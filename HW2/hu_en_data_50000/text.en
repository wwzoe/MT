instead of wearing yourself out about it it s better to not start something that isn t meant to happen

before we re too close and before emotions get deep we should just end it quick
that way you won t be hurt and it ll be easier to forget me

like who are you playing and i ll probably get hit right
sister
i couldn t sleep last night was thinking last night that no matter who i meet i couldn t meet anyone who likes me so much
is this because of yoon and how he s uncomfortable so now that you re just going to grab that dog guy
moonyuk-off the streets and be with him
i understand
chae yoon is mine kang min joo tsk tsk
is it that obvious
when you look at me is it that obvious that i like him when you see it
because you re born as a girl there isn t one girl alive who couldn t love him
how can you not love a cool guy like that
but that cant be sister you can t be with that dog guy
i already kissed him and slept with him are you living in chosun dynasty
ancient time of korean history

hey will
wanted to tell you something but we forgot
okay
thanks for coming
no wait
was it about his hair
yes you already told me that my hair looks like that chocolate topping that hardens when you put it on ice cream
it totally does
our business here is done
wait
i know what it was
trans am
right
my trans am s been acting up again
i gotta take it into the shop
it s lurching and sputtering and making weird noises
sounds like me when i try to dance
will
love yourself man
you need to follow me to the garage
craig you need to bring the booty mug
the booty mug
you still use that thing
course
gives me street cred with guys who do manly jobs
the pipes are corroded
it s gonna cost you 1 000 bucks
1 000
you sure about that chief
you seem like a pretty good guy
i can probably do it for $ 200
all right
i m gonna go look at some playboys
call me when you re done you got it
there isn t anything that mug can t do
kenny you should just work on your car yourself
there s nothing like the satisfaction of fixing something with your own hands
will you know i have no mechanical skills
my only true skills are lick-bathing myself like a cat and shake-drying myself like a dog
one time i walked in on you taking a bath belly-down like a seal
keeps my butt-tocks cool so
i ve got news
grant and i are thinking of moving in together
really well that is great
i got to say this is the healthiest relationship that you have ever had
but first i want to provoke him into having a big ugly fight
there s the girl i know
it s just we ve never fought and i want to know what that s like before i commit
well that makes sense theresa says not meaning it but trying to be supportive
when i was with kenny fighting was the worst thing about our marriage
that and sleeping with him was like being steamrolled by a bag of elbows
well good luck getting grant to fight
it d be easier to get a rainbow to flip you off
i know
the man has no buttons to push
this one however is all buttons
hey kenny
shmermi
shmermi
what the hell does that mean
you re relentless
you guys ready to go
shut up bro
didn t mean that
that was the booty mug talkin
since you re following me to the mechanic s you should know that something clear and sticky is spewing out of the trans am s tailpipe
it is outrageously flammable so keep your distance
i don t know why you keep that piece of junk kenny
i still think dad only gave it to you as punishment for quitting football
i didn t quit football
i was thrown off the team for crying and that car s just a little quirky
no it s a giant quirk that s a little car-y
i worked on it with dad when we were kids kenny i should know
let it die already
it s just showing its age
who here among us hasn t at some point in their lives spewed a clear flammable liquid
my god
am i the only one
compression s out of whack rings are shot timing belt needs replacing
i m gonna nod like i understand but i have no idea what you re talking about
all right try this $ 5 000
craig
booty
do something
you sure about that number big dog
you seem like a good guy
can t help you with the money but i d love to go bowling with you sometime
no
kenny come here
we can totally fix your trans am ourselves
i have tons of car tools
lifts gauges uh one of those wrenches uh what s it called
goes
you re not inspiring confidence
ratchet
yes they re filthy animals but how does that help us
kenny i fix stuff around the house all the time
come on
we can totally do this
okay will
i will fix this car with you
tiny little baby lips
i m sorry
there was a lot of fumes in the trans am on the way over
yeah looks like what we ve got here is some of those steel-belted sons of bitches
nice mug
no
it s just an ironic anti-objectification
no seriously i love it
it s funny
it s great to see a guy who s not afraid to be a guy
i m becky
i m craig
so tell me about yourself
wait i m not interested
because i m a guy
i m taking out the recycling
i ll do it
it s my house
but brenda that s recycling
yeah but i ve been thinking who really cares about the planet
as long as it holds up till i m dead screw the next generation
so grant cleans when he gets mad i know
isn t that weird
he s handsome charming and now this
if you tell me that nagging makes him horny i m gonna kill you
the guy s even ironing my sheets
i feel like the pope
for some reason i ve always imagined that the pope has a hot black guy that irons his sheets
so what happened to finding out if you should move in together
yeah i m putting that on the back burner which by the way is very clean
uncle kenny and daddy are arguing in the garage
they said i could have ice cream if i didn t tell you the bad words they said
chocolate please
how can you mix up my car parts with pieces of your lawn mower
i just put a few pieces in the wrong pile okay
i know what i m doing kenny
who s the one who got the master cylinder out
we didn t need to take the master cylinder out yeah
well then how were we supposed to get to the screwdriver that i dropped
yeah this looks about right
boys why don t you consider this the autopsy and just get rid of the body
i can fix this
i m the one who figured out how to get our hands unstuck from the air conditioner vent wasn t i
we re stuck
does anybody even know we re here
i knew this is how death would find me
that wasn t exactly a challenge
we just had to calm down and unclench our fists
i m serious will
this already feels like one of those projects that you start and never gets done like lucy s swing set
lucy doesn t have a swing set
she only has a bag of bolts and chains and swings she plays with next to her lumber pile
damn it will
i m gonna finish that
theresa just gets impatient
she doesn t understand that sometimes a guy needs a little break to come up with a plan
i don t want this thing in my garage forever
if it s still here in a week i m gonna take care of it myself
honestly kenny you should just let it die a dignified death like we didn t do with grandma
this car is nothing like grandma
it doesn t spit or slap or say racist things
but if you don t put it back together i m-a do all that you lazy lily-white snow devil
so i went on my date with becky the tow truck driver and i wore that belt buckle my uncle roger gave me that just says balls
i never understood that buckle
it needs a verb or something
real men don t use verbs
so i problem becky
you me advice
you need to use verbs
fine
becky s great
pretty firm handshake conversationally vulgar
everything you d want in a woman
the thing is she s a sexist
she has a problem with men
no not with men
stupid woman driver
most women should be banned from the road
and look at her cry
crybaby
what are you on your period
okay
here s my advice
dump her
i need different advice
then put up with her
i can t will
sexism goes against everything i believe
people who ascribe stereotypical traits to a group of other people are all the same and they should be rounded up and treated as inferior
maybe you should talk to her
tell her it bothers you
i want to but how does a guy wearing a testicle-referencing belt buckle talk about his feelings
i trouble
hey i need my car will
what are you wearing
shorts
i ve been riding my bike to go do my rounds because some idiot took apart my car and won t put it back together again
i m figuring it out
i went online to do some research but i didn t find anything helpful
but i did see this really funny video of this fat kid on a roller coaster
you will fix this car will
you will will
the question is can he
what
no i m saying can he
what
can he fix the car
i m not gonna fix it he took it apart
he should do it
who will
he will
i know
he will
you kenny i craig
see this is how real men talk
hi will
what s the matter
does it upset you when someone takes apart your car and doesn t put it back together
weird
so that s what we re gonna do
well remember i m the one with all the tools
except the biggest tool of all you
mr patterson
whales are stupid and they take up too much room in the ocean
these get washed on gentle
it s just you
you almost triggered my flight-or-curl-up-into-a-ball response
i hope you don t mind i let myself in
brenda figured out i clean when i get angry and she s been taking advantage of that
i don t want her to benefit from her extremely effective sneak-ery
so why don t you just talk to her about your feelings
isn t that what you hippies do
i m worried if i talk to her about it i ll get angry and that ll make me clean and around and around we ll go
then why don t you make her angry so she sees how it feels
that s the only language that tiny sack of evil understands
okay
how do i make her angry
well when we were married i discovered a few things that piss her off
accidentally throwing up on her while she s sleeping on the plane accidentally throwing up on her while trying to get an eyelash out of her eye accidentally throwing up on
if possible i d love to get out of the whole upchuck arena
well she does hate being scared
i once jumped out of a pile of laundry
she got so mad it made me throw up on her
scare her
like boo
not quite
let me get a beer and we ll work on it
that was better
what the hell
i meant to tell you will stopped by earlier and disassembled your refrigerator
and you just let him
i don t know what sort of arrangement you fellas have
and that s why i gave up cage fighting
i love fighting of course i just hate being caged in
my brothers love fighting too
you should fight them sometime
yeah
she didn t add the check right
big surprise
a woman who can t do math
you know becky you say a lot of negative things about women
yeah
now let s go home and get those pants off you dummy
okay
now
okay
i m gonna tear you up
i m in
kenny
sorry will
my money s on kenny
so becky and i went out last night and she was god-awful but i didn t say anything because my wiener wanted to have a sexy adventure
anyway i figure it s not wrong for me to keep seeing becky as long as i counterbalance her sexist behavior
so whenever i m not with her i m gonna be extra extra super-duper supportive of women
i started this morning
let me
i m sorry i was about to treat you like an incapable woman but instead i will celebrate your powerful female ability
you go girl
you can do it
you can do it
you can do it
lift that water
you go girl
you do it
you can lift that water
lift that water
i m still fine-tuning the concept
what you re doing is crazy
yeah well from the looks of your desk you certainly know crazy
in fact you re a barmaid sitting on crazy s lap and crazy is drunk trying to unbutton your blouse and you re not doing anything to stop him
how am i supposed to answer that
one second
hi will
sorry we missed you
it s the screws from your desk
we re taking a personal day
- well hey guys
i just got a text from theresa
you only have four days to fix my car before she gets rid of it
my god
what happened to your desk
i would have been done fixing your car by now if you hadn t distracted me by acting all crazy
you know crazy
and once crazy gets your blouse unbuttoned he takes you out to a field by the train tracks lays you down on a dog blanket
you just keep staring up at that moon hoping one day you ll get out of this town and prove your daddy wrong because you re a dancer damn it
that s it
i m outta here
what s his problem
i have no idea
not my favorite suit
no
i hope revenge suits you william j
i m just saying that car s taking up room in the garage i can smell it in the house and i need it out of here
well i m not gonna fix it now
your brother s being too big a jerk
will would you come here a minute
i know you don t want to back down for some stupid man reason but can you please fix my brother s car preferably tonight so i can pee without crouching like an ancient roman
i can t fix his car
you were right about me
i don t finish things
i jus i get overwhelmed and i give up
if i really picked apart my personality i d have to say
forget it
well i m giving up on the toilet too and that s sad since it s been the site of some of my greatest victories
look maybe you just need to pick one thing and follow through on it just to show yourself you can do it
not fixing the toilet because the stakes are too high but this did all start with kenny s car
you re right
i need to see something through to the end
and i m gonna get started on that right now
it s happening
global warming
what are you doing in my sleeping quarters
i m taking apart your bed
i m not gonna quit this kenny
i need to prove to myself that i can finish something and that thing is this ridiculous war with you
why don t you just finish putting my car back together you butt-piston
because i have no mechanical abilities whatsoever
then why did you take it apart in the first place
because i have no reasoning abilities whatsoever
so i m gonna disassemble your life piece by piece until there s nothing left but a pile of beard hair and silly t-shirts
i ve never seen you this way before
you re so determined
such man-like qualities
it s like you have a booty mug inside your soul
okay
clearly you want this more than i do
i m gonna figure out another way to fix my car
really
yeah
i saw something through to the end
take that crazy
you were wrong about me
i am a dancer
you go will
live your dreams for the rest of us
you maniac
wait
what are you doing
i m sorry kenny time s up
i know you have a lot of memories with this car but it s time to let it go sweetie
okay get this piece of crap outta here
no
not trans am-mie
you can t tow it if i m sitting in it
god
ow son of a
hang on
so do we have six more weeks of winter or what
ha that s very funny
let me out
not until you do to this car what we re pretty sure that disgruntled nurse did to grandma
fine
i ll reach the latch myself
i choose to stay here for now
okay
i don t understand why you hate this car so much theresa
because it s a jerk
it s not a jerk
i should know what it is kenny
i was the one who spent a summer working on it with dad rebuilding the engine replacing the gears in the differential
i think i see what s going on here
you re upset
about somethin
i m upset because after all of that work dad gave you the car instead of me and it should have been mine
dad was not a great dad theresa
when i was 10 i caught a frog i wanted to keep it as a pet and he wanted to eat its legs
guess who won
and they were delicious
on my prom night i had a pimple and dad pointed at it in front of my date and called it mount facemore
i m sorry dad didn t give you the car theresa
why don t you take it now
how about this instead i ll help you get it running if you let me drive it every once in a while
like when i have a cold and i can t smell anything
deal
high five
hello and welcome to the first hearthstone insurance career day for girls
our theme is craig empowers future women applaud
no
don t do what i say just because i m a man
hey there you are
i was in the neighborhood
thought i d see if you wanted to grab a steak or somethin
what are you doing
i just wandered in here
wh
mr griffith invited my class to hear a talk about a career for girls
i don t know who that is
you re really talking to these girls about careers
that s a waste
why is it a waste
well first of all most of you should not and will never have real jobs
you ll just find a guy to take care of you squirt out a couple of kids and try and hold on to your looks
wait a minute wait a minute
becky i m sorry but your views about women are absolutely horrible
i thought i could get over it because we had fantastic playtime together
i mean really good creative stuff
but the bottom line is i think women can be whatever they want
like a doctor or a lawyer or
what do you want to be sweetheart
a unicorn
and you will be
you see becky
i m a feminist and while i wish she had said something like astronaut instead of a made-up creature i think that these girls can do whatever they put their minds to
i don t believe this
your booty mug is a liar
and to think i almost let you fight my four brothers
mikey tommy danny and steve
four of em
this is a good man
let s parade him around on our shoulders
i don t think that s a good i
actually you know what what am i saying
if you can dream it you can do it ladies
hoist away
so much for my nine years of karate
my god
why did you scare me
i was trying to teach you a lesson about what it feels like to be emotionally toyed with
i did not anticipate it ending in a stabbing
frankly i m surprised about that too
the truth is i m scared about moving in together
maybe we should talk
good idea
i ll start
sometimes it s important to let go of things so you can move on
will had to let go of wanting to be the kind of guy who could fix things
for theresa it was letting go of her anger toward her dad
for brenda and grant it was letting go of their fears so they could take the plunge and move in together
but while it s important to let things go it s also important to realize that some things are worth holding on to
why are you telling us all this
seriously who are these people
they re my friends and i wanted you to hear what they learned so you realize that you too can let go of anything that keeps you from your dreams
this is boring
i thought coming to an insurance company would be fun
frankly tess with an attitude like that you ll never be a unicorn
anyway i learned to let go of something too
good-bye booty mug
stay sharp guys
we gotta win tonight
we cannot go to game seven
sure we can
the tournament s the best of seven so we definitely can go to game seven
had you said i prefer not going to game seven or we shan t go to game seven
that would have been more accurate
and more eloquent
whatever
these tournament games go on late and i wake theresa when i get in bed which she hasn t been happy about
i d really like to wrap this up tonight so i need you to focus
you got it buddy
so kenny how s the new egg chair
fantasteesh
i put in surround sound and a butt warmer
i got a beverage tube
it s like a giant robot chicken laid this just for my comfort
so we re not gonna focus then
of course we are
hey craigger how s the new girl
does she really just like watching you play video games
yep
she is great
we are talking about you sunshine
focus honey
you don t want this tournament going to game seven yeah
that s how will should have said it
i m taking fire guys
who s got my back
where are you
i m reloading the sangria reservoir
i m totally focused bill
and we re going to game seven
i thought we were gonna try and wrap this up tonight
isn t it fantastic
i ve wanted a family portrait like this ever since we had kids
my goodness
why are you all so small and flat
- i m just kidding
- that s my impression of the first guy who ever saw a painting
looks like the artist got a little generous with your cleavage
yeah he insisted my body type could handle it
he said i ll get used to them
yeah
good morning
that s a nice-looking family gathered around those boobs
how d you sleep
terrible
you woke me up when you finally came to bed and the neighbor s stupid motion detector light was going off again all night shining in our window
our new neighbor is a jerk
it s not just the light
every time the kids lose a ball over his fence he refuses to give it back
i have no tolerance for that
will you need to go over there and get your balls back
i know that sounds like a metaphor but it is not because that man has your actual balls which also sounds like a metaphor and also is not
i talked to him
believe me we really went at it
- hi glenn
- what
so i-i was trying to fish my kids balls out of your backyard with my rake and so n-now you also have my rake and my longer rake and okay
well at least your stupid video game tournament is over so i don t have to worry about you waking me up anymore
yeah about that
the tournament s not actually over
you said it was only gonna be six games
i overestimated my team s focus
in that i thought they had any
but it s okay
i don t have to play tonight
i mean the you know the guys are super excited about it and it only happens once a year but i can skip it even though it s just one more night
thank you honey
i appreciate it
you told her you weren t gonna play
this tournament is as important as anything we will ever do in our lives right why would you do that
if anything you re understating it
you know guys we wouldn t even have this problem if you d had my back last night instead of making out with your new girlfriend and messing with your sangria tank
there was a chunk of orange stuck in my drinking tube
did you want me to just leave it there
it could have choked me will
you are unbelievable
first you endanger our entire tournament and now you want kenny to die
what is wrong with you
i got it
i got the solution
fortunately for you i m a pharmaceutical rep
with a bagful of tricks one of which is
wonunol
when you can t sleep take wonunol
remember
wonunol
take one y all
yee-haw sleep
they re still working on the campaign
anyway it s all natural there s no hangover and it s tiny so you can hide one in theresa s applesauce
i m not gonna hide drugs in my wife s food
come on
but don t worry
i m gonna play tonight
i ll just lie to theresa and tell her i m not going to then i ll wear my silk pajamas and when she s asleep i ll slip out of bed like a ninja a comfortable ninja who s used to the finer things
i finished my homework
can i go to bed early
are you sneaking out tonight
stealing a car
hitting the clubs
no i just ate too much pie and i want to go to bed
nathan it s okay
your father s just kidding
of course you can go to bed
you got a girl up there
mom
it s too easy
lucy you go get ready too i ll be right up
god i haven t slept more than two hours in a row this week
if anyone wakes me up again tonight i swear i m gonna kill them to death and please don t wear those silk pajamas you took out
really
why not
well they get all staticky and then i keep getting shocked
i feel like i m sleeping with someone who s trying to get information out of me
you know i was talking to kenny about your problem and and he s kinda like a doctor and he gave me this
thing
it s supposed to be this great new sleep supplement or something
you trying to knock me out so you can play your stupid video game
what
i told you i am not playing tonight
i m just trying to help you sleep and this pill s supposed to be amazing
i don t like pills
it s not a pill
it s really more of an organic sleep vitamin with metabolism-boosting uh anti-aging molecules
i think one of the actresses from mad men takes it
really
that is a smart show
we are good to go and we still have an hour to practice before the tournament starts
so theresa s sleeping
yep
i got her to take the wonunol
that thing was originally developed as a horse tranquilizer
they just changed the formula for humans by cutting it in half
you gave my wife a horse tranquilizer
no you gave your wife half a horse tranquilizer
will it s fine
trust in science
pills make everything better
in ten years we won t even need people anymore
it ll just be pills giving each other pills
yeah there ll be pill police officers
there ll be pill firemen
the pill president
he ll be pill clinton
dad
i threw up pie
lots and lots of pie more pie than i ate
did she say she threw a pie
it s all right honey
guys i might have a situation
dad i don t feel so well
will what s going on over there
i definitely have a situation
that sound
god i miss college
just gonna throw these sheets in the wash kids
stay in the bathroom and aim for anything porcelain
what are you guys doing here
we knew your hands were full so we brought the tvs over so you can play
and we ve still got a half an hour till the game starts so we re gonna teach grant how to play and then he can sub in for you when you get distracted by the disgusting vomitorium that is your home
although i ve never done this before i will not let you down
my only question is
i deplore violence is there a button on here for diplomacy
we ve got your back will you just don t want to bail on the tournament you don t have my back
don t do this will
not in front of gina
this is gina
hey will i m gina
don t do this in front of me
i drove all the way here with my egg chair on top of my car
if that s not having your back i don t know what is
that s not having my back
then i don t know what is
guys the game is not really my priority right now
my kids have a stomach bug somebody drugged my wife
you
and i m gonna go start some laundry
you have a lovely house
do you mind if i look around
yeah sure
i just met you
wander around my home
dad can i have a glass of water
i got this will
i have a soothing effect on the infirm and for some reason the downtrodden and every once in a while the misbegotten
so do you like gina
yeah sure
why not
she told me not to tell anybody but she s a kleptomaniac
she has claws instead of hands
no that s not what a kleptomaniac is
it s somebody who has a compulsion to steal things
it s a disease
well if she has a stealing disease should we be letting her walk around will s house looking for things to steal according to her therapist
i m supposed to show her that i trust her
besides will doesn t have anything that great anyway
i m a bumblebee and i need to see the moon because it helps me navigate
karate chop
that was weird
and she s naked from the waist down
that s very unlike her
i think i need to check something online
hey
so um craig s keeping an eye on the kleptomaniac
what
right
let me back up
hey will
gina s a kleptomaniac
- what
- i know
but you ve got a bigger problem
theresa s up god
what no
did she see all the game stuff
i am so busted
you said she was gonna sleep all night
i didn t say she s awake
i said she s up
i just went online and i did a little research on wonunol
one of the occasional side effects is walking around in a dream state with no pants on due to an insatiable urge to air-cool the lower torso commonly called winnie the poohing
and that s what she s doing
very much so
that s a nice vase
man will and theresa would really miss that vase if anybody took it which i m sure no one will
thank you
it feels so great when you trust me
i want to give you back your meat thermometer
this is not mine but thank you
don t steal the vase
don t steal the vase
don t steal the vase
don t steal the vase
don t steal the vase
don t steal the vase
hello
no
where s theresa
she sent me an e-mail asking me if i wanted to make pancakes with sting
obviously yes i do but something just didn t seem right
everything s fine
false alarm
go back to your witch farm
is that my egg chair
did you take that out of my garage
no that is my egg chair that you spitefully took in our divorce that you never use
you told your friends i have kleptomania
it s nothing to be ashamed of
it s the most common mania to have after wrestle and beatle
what was that
that was craig
you know craig
the kids are back in bed
why are you here
hello brenda
i won t insult your intelligence
there s some tomfoolery going on around here and i m up to my ankles in it
you
brenda
theresa and i we were uh just out for a walk but she s tired and so won t be speaking
good evening madam
your table is almost ready
except for that
well good night
give us back our balls
hey will
we got your back
god
now what did you do
they told me everything
we tried not to but then she asked
look wonunol s been tested extensively and patients don t remember a thing the next morning
of course most of those patients were horses but still we should be fine as long as brenda keeps her vodka chute shut
yeah that s winning me over
brenda it would really be good if theresa didn t know that i talked her into taking an all-natural clydesdale roofie
i won t say a thing
daddy i threw up in my bed again
coming honey
i ll even help with the kids as long as assquatch gives me back my chair in its original condition before theresa wakes up
what
no way
that s a terrible deal guys
let s walk
hey wait
come on kenny
you re on the hook for this too
if theresa finds out what happened she will hold you down and force you to slap your own face just like she did last christmas
yeah why wouldn t that happen to me
hey
did will ask you to do that to his floor
no i was looking for some tools so i could dismember my chair so my sister won t make me slap myself in the face again
have you seen gina
no
do you know how to clean paint off of a hardwood floor
no
see you don t like it when i yell at you
good thinking
you got paint on the floor
i knew i could count on you
my god
and some got on theresa s eye
so i got a little paint on the painting
that s like spilling water in a swimming pool
you ve got to fix this and restore the chair and clean the floor and find the kleptomaniac
we got your back will
and stop saying that
what are you doing
where s theresa
i don t know
i ll tell you what
you check the rest of the house
i m gonna wait here for her
help me find her
you re leaving
well i have to
you are really disappointing me a lot this evening craig
that s an ominous thing to say
that s not any better is it
nope it s worse
so gina is getting a little weird
really the kleptomaniac you met on the internet is getting weird
here
you re an artist
go get nathan s paints and fix this thing while i go look for theresa and you strip that chair down so that brenda keeps her mouth shut
will s house is kinda hectic at night isn t it
yeah i couldn t live here
take that you light-lovin ball thief
now i ll never get my rake back
or my longer rake
hey i need an allen wrench so i can keep murdering my chair
take care of this while i get theresa inside
rickshaw
what
goody
another task
okay so theresa s sleeping again or still or whatever the hell she s been doing
and i finished that painting hang on
great
and i developed a pretty good move where i spin in a circle firing indiscriminately
i call it the tornado of death so if you hear me yell tornado of death find a ditch and pray
maybe this will work out
brenda s with the kids
the game starts in five minutes
i think we might have pulled this off buddy
couple problems
i m hoping they re not related
the painting has disappeared and gina s car is gone
are are you kidding
that s it
i m dead
theresa s gonna kill me
no will
the four of us are gonna go get that painting back
but your precious video game is about to start
this whole evening is my friend kenny s fault
should we forgive him
don t see how we can
should he be punished
unmercifully
i think what craig is trying to say is he brought the klepto over and so the whole thing is his fault and even though that is without doubt or controversy the only explanation for tonight
i m gonna help you too
i agree
kenny s entirely to blame and this conversation is over
no restarts infinity
even though i have no responsibility for any of this because i am in no way at fault i want to help too
again summing up grant helpful but blameless
now let s do this
gina honey
i think there may have been a misunderstanding about whose painting of will s family that is
you hurt my feelings craig
go away
baby
okay
no more coddling
listen up you psycho
my god
my beautiful eyes
kenny aah
they re ruined
guys come on
there s an open window
but what
i m going in
shh kenny
no
god
shh kenny bees
rose-scented bees
kenny no shh
it s rosebushes
look we need a ladder or or suits of leather or a-a japanese garden bridge
that would be lovely
here s what we re gonna do
i m gonna lie down
you guys grab my arms and legs swing me back and forth build up some momentum and then toss me as hard as you can
i ll twist in the air grab the window and pull myself in
any questions
nobody
really
okay i ll go
are you insane
will i can do this
i did gymnastics in high school for like six weeks
watch
god you sound so nimble
the trick is to let go of my arms a split second before you let go of my legs so i twist in the air and i can grab the window frame with my hands
remember arms and then legs
it s critical that you do it in that order
otherwise this might not work
come on
i ll call it out
all right
here
here here here
okay hey
and swing
and keep swinging
remember it s arms and then legs
here we go
two here it goes
arms legs
arms legs
no
did he make it
is he in
- wrong
that was wrong
- craig
gentlemen
what s going on here tonight
how you doing spider-man
truthfully i m in a lot of pain
it was nice of gina to give us the painting back
the police made her give it back because she stole it because there s a monkey in a wedding dress jumping on a trampoline where her brain should be
she has a disease kenny
would you talk that way about somebody who had freckles or an itchy trigger finger or a case of the munchies
you don t know what diseases are do you craig
guys please
i just had the worst night of my life
all i want is one moment of quiet before i walk into my house and have the worst morning of my life
keen
get over here
you said fix it
it wouldn t wash off
you know anything about this keen huh
you know what glenn
i do know something about this and if you had adjusted your stupid motion light i never would have treated my wife like a horse and none of this would have happened and yes that does make sense so move the light and throw my kids balls back or you are gonna find all kinds of crazy-ass things
painted all over your house
you understand
yeah
sure
good and no more mowing your lawn in your khaki pants
i don t like it
it s weird
listen last night when gina took the painting you guys really did have my back so thank you
sure
you got it
it was worth it
plus i learned when you run into police in the middle of the night it goes a whole lot smoother if you re with a bunch of white dudes
well here goes
put the painting in the hallway
there they are
brenda told me everything
thank you for taking care of the kids and letting me sleep
god that pill really worked
i feel so much better
wonunol - say
i gotta pop the sheets in the dryer
you didn t tell her
i love theresa and i figured it would break her heart if she found out what an idiot she married
it would
it really really would
but where does she think we were
i told her you all got up early to clean out my garage which you will be doing today
also i hid all your adolescent crap around the side of the house including the egg chair that you can keep kenny
it was enough just to watch you destroy your precious nerd capsule
i shall rebuild it and it shall be stronger faster with a sunroof and a thing to pee in
will could you come here for a second
look at my eye
what happened
i have no idea
but i think your body type can handle it
get in the car
who are you
i m the man whose money you took
he ll get done sooner or later
i made a call
there s one thing nobody can escape from it don t matter how big a master criminal you are

they picked us off
they re probably using the money for some extremist movement
so now we re funding terrorists

dear god please help me see danger coming my way and forgive the body count i will be sending your way

we should go en masse and demand to speak to whoever s in charge and make them understand they can t just keep us here
there s laws and protocols
you think they ll care about that
they still have to abide by them
says who
woody this is our government
governments can t just hold us indefinitely for no reason
what you on about

posted some things on the web
things i thought people should see secrets
there are no secrets
only hidden truths
nah
just bitching about the food and the way they treat people
now they think i m bloody wikileaks
dickheads
how long do they usually keep people in here for
as long as they want
that s the point
this place don t exist

fortunately for you we re not actually interested in what you did over the last few days
all we wanted to know was who you were financing
we weren t financing anyone
we were just trying to get home
with five million euros
we have at our disposal dna databases forensic analysis satellite imaging technology
if that doesn t give us what we need we employ enhanced interrogation techniques
if we want to find out the truth we do
and now we have
we made a mistake
it happens
so you can go
just sign these and we ll get you to the airport and on a flight
hang on
does that mean that we can
please don t ask if you can keep the money
do you want us to do anything for you back home
little candle-lit vigil
coloured rubber wrist bands - free mercedes

mrs peters 101 bridge road crawley
it s my mum
just let her know i m all right
don t mention this eh
you take care of yourself
seriously
did you really think we were going to get out of there
two nights in nah thought that was it
what went through your mind
well first of all my kids
carmen and then just like stupid stuff like
i thought i d never get to see united play again
i kept thinking of my kids
kept seeing their little faces
then i thought about nina
i started to think about all the things they d find out about me you know when i was dead
and what if they stopped loving me
i wouldn t be there to tell them that that s not what i m like
be honest kid you were worried about her finding your porno collection
nah i don t know
things that might be misinterpreted
you know e-mails receipts
yeah i didn t think of that
i wonder what people would really make of all this back home
they might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together saying they were going to spain and actually ending up in morocco
if anyone so much as mentions bad luck they re walking
be a long walk back pal we ve been driving for nearly an hour
haven t seen so much as a camel
he s gone
he s not coming back is he
two stay two go and get help
shouldn t we all go
why
or stay
we ll double our chances if we split
halve them you mean
who wants to stay
i do
i do
i do
i ll go
come on
you two stay here if the driver comes back just all stay with the car all right
do you believe in destiny bax
no
so shut up
fate then

this is just a series of misunderstandings ok
could have happened to anybody
no more no less
who s
come on
get in
you are about to be shot get in
bax get in
woods
quinn
hey
slow down slow down
- we had some disturbing intel
- well if it s bad news can you just lie to me
i d like to know what s going on please
a covert department of the cia the special activities division has activated a kill contract on you
sorry
what are you talking about
evidently you ve intersected a line of narco-finance and
wait
stop hang on
now this might be because of the sun and this whole desert shot at scenario thing but i m just finding it a little hard to concentrate
would you mind talking to me as if i m five years old
your man in majorca has operated successfully for so long because he gives huge kickbacks to the american security services
what
he s paying the cia to protect him
narco-finance is a major revenue stream - for american black ops
- like a five-year-old please
dirty tricks
security activities they don t want people to know about
drugs deals have been financing dodgy us foreign policy for years
not really new news
why would they want to kill us
one of you tipped off the authorities in the uk
a contact inside customs and excise
your man here retaliated by telling the special activities division you were about to blow their op wide open
so now they have to take you out
no this this is crazy i mean
why can t you just tell them all right that we re not the people that they think we are
this goes higher than us
this kind of thing brings down governments
iran contra anyone
which is why removing you is an easy piece of damage limitation
they can t just shoot four blokes who just happened to go on holiday together
under the aegis of the global war on terror they can shoot anyone they like
and do
that s who shot at us
the cia no
they d have tasked local contractors
so nothing can be linked back to them
you got lucky
but this isn t going to go away
ok let s get practical then
so what are the options
well there must be something
right
right - there may be a solution but we have to act now
like this minute
your presence here is getting a little itchy for us
excuse us for the inconvenience
we may be able to get you out take you to another country new identities
then what
then i m afraid you re on your own
how long would this be for
maybe for ever
- we can never go home
- it s the only offer on the table
no no no that s
that s not an option
no
i m going home and
if you go back you ll be putting your families at risk as well
that is a guarantee
ok let me just see if this is even logistically possible
stand up
get up
ok
we can do it
we have a scrambled phone link
you can each of you make one phone call home but you must not under any circumstances tell them where you are and what is happening
amy
yeah i know i m sorry that i haven t rung
listen to me for a second love
nina
just stop just let me talk darling ok
right
there s no easy way of saying this ok so i m just going to say it straight out
i m not coming back
wait wait wait -
i don t know who to phone
well i do i want to speak to my kids but i don t know which one to choose
if i ve only got one call which one do i call
you can t make me choose
i need you to phone my folks i want you to tell them that i m fine and everything s ok that i m just going to go travelling for a little bit
rachel are the girls with you
where are they
shit
i want you to tell the girls that i love them both very much

yeah just take care
yeah
i love you dad take care
bye-bye

i know you all think it s my fault don t you

i don t know the universe conspiring against us or something
and has been since we set foot in alvo s villa
a fly saved my life
what
out in the desert
if it hadn t been for that fly i d have had my head blown off
and the weird thing was we d met before we d bonded

yeah why don t you marry me and take me to england
your name isn t newhouse is it
how dare you and how dare you try and blackmail me
help
previously on siberia
a tiger
a fucking tiger
i couldn t believe it
it was like something a seven year old would tell me oh i saw a tiger in the woods
- what are you doing
- wondering what would do that to a tiger
oh hell
it s on fire and it s green
- what s on fire
- the sky
you know there s something about carolina
i feel like i recognize her
- fire in the woods man
- got to get some water
i told you this was a mistake
that s all we had man
that s all we had
does anyone recognize this
we found johnny s shirt
and it was full of food from the shed
i get what it looks like i see that but i didn t steal the food and i didn t burn down the shed
someone obviously doesn t like me and they re trying to set me up
people weren t taking too kindly me being at camp cause apparently i stole food from the shed and then burned it down
someone framed me
they wrapped my shirt around some food hid it in the woods
i don t know who did it
you know frankly i don t really care anymore you know
i don t really need them anyways
you know obviously i can take care of myself
took them how long to build a fire
i did it in five minutes in the dark
i can t believe johnny s gonna just stay out in the woods
that s crazy
and why shouldn t he after all the crap that he s pulled
he ll be fine
and if he s not you got a better chance of winning
and you can keep his bed
i want to make it to the end but i want to do it as a team kind of like how neeko s doing it you know
can i tell you something
sure
you re a smart guy
you know that neeko is a professional athlete
he plays game for living
how about maybe he s playing this game that he s a very nice guy everybody trusts him just to win the game
have you ever thought about it
i don t think you should trust him
can t trust anybody
guys
i get up early and as soon as i open the door i practically ran into this spear that s stuck in the ground
it felt like a threat
let me see
what does it say
it says
what is that
it means get out
it s just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell s going on here
it s a nice prop
look at it
it s not real
nice scare tactic
they re watching
i m sure they re loving this
why is it in front of our cabin and not yours
who wants you guys to get out
well this is here on purpose
that s for sure it s here on purpose
it s here for a reason you guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this really
who else could ve left that spear besides production who could ve done it
we re the only people out here
aren t we
- are you okay
- i m fine
i mean aren t you still scared
the spear this morning telling us to leave that doesn t scare you at all
i think at this point it s just all mind games
i miss home i miss my family i even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend
this place is- - it s getting to me
i don t know
i m thinking about pushing the button
i don t want you to go
you know what i mean
i think- - i think we can win this
we just need to- -
but i don t need to stay
i don t understand why i m even staying i don t need the money that badly
i do
annie
i ve been a lone wolf for a while you know
i ve been on my own for a while
i m probably without knowing it less lonely than i have been in a long time because i m interacting with people more often than i have in many years
now i consider daniel a friend
he s a good kid
if i had a son i d be proud if he was like daniel
what are you looking at
- just watching those two - mm-hmm
i don t want to overstep my bounds you know
i don t know how she feels about me and so i m just kind of- -
i m taking it slow but at the same time it s really hard cause i really want to you know see where this is gonna go
i don t know
at the same time i don t want to get hurt
don t worry she knows you exist
how would i really get her to
i don t know like
get her to what
like me like me
you can t get her to like you
either she does or she doesn t
you know

i m not going back to a life or a job that i like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend and i get that you re sad about that
but you re forgetting about who s here for you right now and you re turning your back on me
no i m not
i like her
it s been a while since i ve been with anybody but i- - we get along so well
i just feel like a dumbass now
i mean she s probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time if she does stay
- hey - there you are
- how s it going
good
i just wanted to talk to you
uh-huh um so victoria s gone um i m just wondering what s going on with her bed
oh it s- - well it s free right now
so no one would mind if i moved in
i mean i don t mind
i don t know what the other girls other think but it s good with me
awesome
all right i ll go grab my things
it s not that i didn t have fun with the boys i don t know i just feel like my time there is done
it s served its purpose and i want to- -
i want to get to know the girls a bit better
- hey - what are you doing
- i m leaving
you mean the show
no you idiot
i m gonna move into victoria s old bed
wait
why
why because it s free
i know but i thought you liked it here with me
you said we are great roommates
yes we were and thank you for letting me stay
just i don t know i want to be with the girls now
come on esther
don t you think we should team up
we are both smarter than everyone else here
we can win this thing- - together
ohh i like your style
i will think about it
but hold on hold on
hold on i was just thinking that we could have something
you thought what
that we could get romantic a little bit
don t laugh
really i don t do romance
look we re playing a game
what do you mean
i m playing a game- - for money
i don t do romance and i m not playing a dating game
i m sorry
you re not going anywhere
get the fuck off me
i m kidding
i was just kidding esther
i m just kidding esther
don t you fucking touch me again
come on i m just-
- i was just kidding
i think i was in shock i-i don t know
it happened so quickly
but he grabbed me here pushed me up against the bunk and then he backed off esther is a player
we all know that
and i played with her too so she was on the way out
i just pushed her a little bit on the bed just jokingly like pretending that i m like scaring her
you re gonna stay here or something
she just like freaked out she pushed me away
she s like don t talk to me like that
stormed out like mad
and i was just telling her i m joking you know me
i always joke around
i was just joking with you i didn t get it seriously
she just freaked out and it was just a pure joke
what are you showing me it was right here
are you sure
big huge carcass
guts hanging out and everything
look
look at what the blood
it could ve been anything it could ve been a bird
it could ve been a deer why would i make this up
why would i lie
there was a huge- - there was a huge tiger there
i guess they took it
the producers took it
the producers
i think she thinks that i could ve been trying to scare her play a sick joke on her
i was kind of a bit shocked because i didn t think she saw me as that kind of person for all i know johnny took it
johnny took it
he probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something
i don t know
oh now johnny does everything
not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us we got to worry about that guy
hopefully he s done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here i don t think he s as bad as you think
why are you always defending him why are you always defending him
i m telling you that guy s dangerous
you need to watch yourself
i m kind of baffled where it s gone you know cause this thing was pretty big you know
it would ve taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there and there was no trail
there was no kind of like a trail of where it could ve been dragged to
it s like it was almost picked up and gone
got some traps set up along this way somewhere i found some deer trails i scouted earlier
hope they catch something
the first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome actually had a nice little fire
weather was nice
you know wrapped up
it was nice being on my own
it s what i wanted to do originally too is you know be by myself take care of myself do my own thing and i got that so pretty content
what the hell did this man this thing s
i mean it obviously it ripped the deer while it was standing here it was strong enough to rip it off- - rip the like rip its bone in half
what do you want
what are you doing
i m trying to catch some food but something got to it before me it looks like
what do you want
i just came to try to convince you to come back
try to convince me to come back to the camp
yeah i don t think it s safe for you to be out here
i think it s safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don t like me thanks to you making those wild accusations just whatever happened
i don t think it s safe for you to stay out here well you know what
i really don t need you trying to be nice to me
i ll be fine on my own okay
i can take care of myself
y all try taking care of yourselves too all right
okay fine
if that s how you want to be then fine fine
nah that s- - that s not good enough
that ain t good enough
hey irene
hey dan whatcha doing
collecting some acorns
if you mash them up you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it
- really - yeah
is it- - does it taste good
i think so
you want me to help oh sure
that d be great yeah
they re kind of scattered all over
daniel is a really really nice really sweet person and he has such a gentle- - a very gentle spirit
it s a siberian squill
i m not really big on flowers
why not
well you know they re pretty but it s kind of odd the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower cause it s like oh you know i like you so let me give you something that s dying
it never really made sense to me
something more permanent would be nice you know even a rock would be better
she s got so much complexity to her you know
i find out something new about her every day it seems like and it s a pretty big thing that i would ve never expected out of her
she s just- - she s amazing
where are we
i can t find the path
we re lost
- we re not lost - no we re lost
i don t know where we re going
in the middle of the wood very close to the river i found this really weird-looking tree
i mean it wasn t a tree
it was something different
it had a face shape it had hair
what my name is miljan
it s really nice to meet you
what is your name ogdee
this is my friend ogdee
we go way back man
he s so bad
i spoke to it
we had a little conversation
ogdee is my old friend from high school

i heard it come on
there might be something out here come on
oh oh god
what are you doing out here
sorry i m going to get water
where are you going
home- - where the hell is it
that way
why is she being such a bitch
why are you here by the way alone
no reason
that s suspicious
shut up miljan
guys have you seen carolina
no she hasn t come back
you mean she s not back yet
she s not back i have no idea where she is
i haven t seen her
you do know she s out there with johnny
yeah tell me about it i know
well i don t know about you but i feel like i should go and look for her
i don t- - i don t feel comfortable with her with johnny
before it gets too late i think we should
i m game yeah
- you re gonna come with me
- yeah
gentlemen
where the hell were you
i was in the woods
have you seen carolina
she s out there with johnny
oh she ll be fine guys
- come on - are you serious yes
they re probably having sex or something
oh you re a funny guy
don t be naive
you didn t notice the chemistry they had
hey guys listen
i m gonna look for her i don t know about you
just sitting here talking
hey it s dark outside
oh fuck
get on the bed get onto the bed
the bed
oh my god
what is this
the cab started shaking
ran outside and the sky this just this odd color that i ve never seen in my life and i m thinking it can t be the show doing this because that s way out of their powers and their control
it s like- - it s like the sky s on fire
what
it s like the sky s on fire
the sky went from dark to light and it looked like it was on fire just like victoria said
if this is all part of the game it s beyond me at this point
i don t understand how they could pull it off
i feel like i m on another planet
i feel like i walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare and nobody- - nobody has any answers i don t have an answer
i could sit here all day long and just- - it s way above my pay scale
- is it moving
- it just keeps moving
carolina never came back today did she yeah where- - where are they
she s still in the woods- - the forest
well this can t stop us
we still have to find her
we can t leave her out there
we better go now
we re just gonna go look for her- - me and sam daniel miljan as well
oh my god
carolina
carolina are you okay
what happened oh my god
carolina
- what happened
are you okay
- are you okay
then we see carolina stumbling towards the girls cabin and the girls go rushing over to her
are you hurt somewhere
- what happened
- look at all the blood what happened
she s bleeding
guys don t don t- - don t go to her back up
oh my god look at her arm
look at her arm
what happened to you you re okay
carolina what happened
carolina shows up and she s battered and disoriented
she couldn t even speak she s trembling
i don t
she doesn t remember
you don t remember
what do you remember
she didn t know what was going on
she was saying she couldn t even like remember what she d been doing out there
she was just talking nonsense and it was really jolting to see her come back like that
_
you were with john
- and what happened
- where is he
what were you doing with johnny get her some water
get her some help
carolina were you with johnny she said she was
what were you doing with johnny
_
_
she said the name johnny
at that point i just you know lost it listen to me
listen to me listen to me for what
here just come here
come here
i want to say something to you - what
- listen to me
it s important
you got to make sure
you look at his hands okay
his hands are a tell-tale sign okay
his hands will tell you if he did something what are you doing
where are you going
stay here with the girls
stay here with the girls
i m not wasting any more time with this guy
everyone wants to keep him around thinking oh yeah he ll turn around and be a good guy
no i don t think so
i m not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back
- she s been through a lot - yeah
we re gonna look after you okay don t worry
we don t know where johnny is
carolina sort of- - she couldn t say much but she said that she was- - they were fighting- - her and johnny were fighting
and then now she looks like this so johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because sam and neeko went after him
let s just keep moving
move move
_
the whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that you know- -
we stop and we look and there s nothing there
it s just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you re being watched you know
whether you know whether you re in the woods or in the cabin you always feel like something is watching you and the past two nights
i haven t slept very well you know
so i m just- - you know you re always looking over your shoulder
you always think something s there and like the whole thing with the sky now
i don t know
well he s obviously around here somewhere
yes you keep saying he he
look how thick the brush is here
if there s somebody around here we d see them
we hear other things
all of a sudden something goes flying
i think we should be talking more in the sense of what
i ll go see if the water s boiled
thank you
i don t want to die
i didn t ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show and every day that i m here
i feel like i m an idiot for staying that i am gonna end up like tommy
i don t deal well with- - abuse is not something that i can handle right now
i m scared
and johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food
i just- - how could he do that to her
it didn t make sense
she s such a nice lady
johnny
hey what did you do
- huh - what did you do to carolina
i don t know what you re talking about
what do you mean you don t know what i m talking about
- what d you do to her - i didn t- -
she s all cut up and shit
i don t- - i don t know i
what s wrong with you
i don t know i just-
- i kind of came to i was walking around and
i don t know i was- - i saw her
you saw her where
you got to tell me what happened
we were in the woods and i don t really- - i don t really remember
i get approached by daniel and basically started accusing me of hurting carolina
i didn t know what to say
what did you to do her
the last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you so you can t come back here and tell me that you didn t touch her
i don t
then what happened to her
i don t know
that s not a very good answer right now man
i don t- - trust me
hey you hear that
at the camp
let s go
i don t know
are you serious you don t know
you re such a scumbag
oh what
so she just fell down and ended up that way
are you kidding me
i was in a complete haze
i had no recollection
i was like blacked out like i drank too much
he doesn t look like he knows what s going on i don t
- then what happened to her
- i don t know
i don t know
you were together weren t you - you said that
- shit
neeko
neeko
guys he doesn t know
- motherfucker - come on
stop it - stop
stop it - come on stop it
he didn t do it carolina starts screaming it s not him
he didn t do it
stop it
what do you mean you said you don t remember
you said you don t remember
you re a dead man you re a fucking dead man
listen listen
hey hey hey
calm down
listen - what happened
- i don t know
talk to me
i don t know
johnny doesn t know anything
he doesn t remember anything
it was just her and him in the forest
i know that i know that i saw it in his eyes okay
all i remember is i talked to her
we were arguing
and then i-i came here and i started getting accused and i don t even know what the fuck is going on if we caught him in the woods he would ve been dead
when i saw that look in his eyes
i just felt that i needed to take a step back remember the way she came into camp
he s got the same look on his face does she remember anything
show us your hands
i ve seen that before
what s that from
nothing s making sense here
and just to be angry and become a bunch of animals- -
we can t go killing each other
we re still human beings
i don t like things that i can t explain and that i don t have at least some sort of control over
the sky changing color and looking like fire- - the producers the show can t do that
we re talking supernatural stuff now
regardless of everything else that s real and that scared the hell out of me
it seems like everybody at camp was convinced that i was the person that hurt her i ve never hit a woman in my life
i don t know why i would
i don t remember anything but
i can t say that i didn t cause i don t- - i don t know what happened but i know in my heart i wouldn t do that
all i remember is that i was with- -
went to get johnny he was in the woods
i found him and i
it s all one big blur like one big blackout
i have all these marks on my body and my shirt is broken and i don t remember i don t understand
so you re telling me this is real yes
it looks like it s native handmade
it looks like it s just a prop to me
well if it s a prop it s really well-made cause you see the barbs
that s exactly how it should look
this is ox
it s real ox
and it s balanced for throwing
it just looks perfect
it s your choice to believe in it or not but this is real so
i don t have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true what is not i have to know the environment i m in
i have to know what s out there in order to protect myself and survive
look at this so i found this symbol that is really strange
it has four lines and little triangles on the ends
then i found another one and another one and i realized it s a path i should follow them
at the end it was very close to the settlement
i found the last one
and i found this box
it was a metal box i opened it and it was a book
i didn t understand anything because it was in a different language
i would assume it s russian because it s cyrillic letters
it was a person he s staring at me and he just disappeared in a second
so there are people out there
i was just gonna try and make things better and like apologize and just wanted to let her know that i didn t you know i didn t want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her
i guess i was in a weird mood and i just want to apologize because i don t want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything because i m really glad you re- -
when i realized what annie s real feelings were for me
i just thought i m sort of open to love in any form right now
so i kissed her
which i kind of surprised myself at to be honest
i m okay you
i wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing cause i knew she had scratches and stuff on her and she was sure freaked out like i was
do you remember anything from last night
no
i don t remember anything either
but i know you didn t hurt me
♪ people in life they will come and go ♪ ♪ like the boats sailing by my door ♪
♪ you can be the ocean you can be the shore ♪
♪ this mystery wind she will always blow ♪ ♪ don t worry don t worry dear no more ♪

why d you set me up
with the shed and the food

episode 1
tae yang
tae yang
yang = a title meaning young miss
miss tae
yes
this afternoon room 404 left again
go clean up
room 404
i don t understand why that room can t go for long without being vacated
is the chest of drawers unlucky
tae yang take the dresser from that room out too
yes
pretend you didn t see
pretend you didn t see
mom
go away
i told you to go
excuse me
a grandmother told me to give you this money
our mother
this money
it s ten million won
it really is
omo
she said to use it to help fund the funeral and use the rest to pay off your debt
mother
there was also something else she wanted me to tell you
please tell me
you rotten bastard
if you ever touch gambling again i ll come and cut your hand off you bastard
don t gamble anymore
is what she said
it really is mom s account book
my word ten million won
how did she have this money
give it to me
that s not all yours half of it is mine
how is it yours
mother told her to deliver this to me
why
so you ll take this too after using everything else
half of it is mine
what did you do to deserve half
what did you ever do for mom
then what did you ever do
you lost and sold everything by gambling
you even took my depos house deposit and i got divorced because of that
was your divorce my responsibility
was it my fault
of course it s your fault
who else s would it be
it s was your fault that s why my fingers got chopped off
is your finger getting cut off my fault
fine then
hit me with that hand
hit me
aish
real
it s not like you did anything right miss to be yelling at oppa
unnie you have no right to say that
who was the one who told him to co-sign
omo
then do we leave oppa to die
for now we have to save him at least
i m so sick of all this really
be quiet
it s not his fault
miss
as if you were ever good to us for you to come and take it all
you re saying that there is a dead spirit here right now
that s right
my dead wife is still here
i ve thought about the kids and i ve even thought about selling the house
but that is not what my dead wife would have wanted
so you ll remain as a stumbling block in the middle of my golf course
fine let s negotiate
if my wife is here right now how can i drive her away
the dead person is here
fine
if she s really here let s negotiate together
what does she say
you will know if you look at that flower
my wife treasured that flower
when i had decided to sell this house that flower wilted and dried up
but just when i decided not to sell it bloomed beautifully again like that
your wife expressed her opinion through that flower
that s what you are saying right
that is correct
if that s the case i guess i ll have to negotiate with the flower
flower wife listen carefully and respond
your husband does not wish to sell this house but i must buy this house
can you really never sell this house
if so please nod your flower neck
if not i ll cut your flower head
what do you plan on doing
can t you see i m negotiating
i will give you 3 seconds to decide
1 2 3
are you crazy
the crazy one is you
trying to overturn a deal closed between living people by dragging in a dead person isn t that crazy
since i cut off your dead wife s wishes for you please follow the wishes of your living children
please sign
you cruel bastard
no matter what you say my wife is here
no she isn t
please come to your senses
if you think lightly of a person s heart and ignore it like this because you can t see it you ll be struck by lightning
i m going to continue to live smartly and well ignoring the things i can t see
if what i say is wrong i ll readily take that lightning strike
there is no lighting that struck me
you just sold this house
congratulations
if there are spirits they ll definitely come to take someone like you
are you really not scared of ghosts joo goon
goon = a title meaning young sir
why should i be afraid of a dead person
the living are scarier
i ll have to re-confirm the contract s contents
please give me the recording
yes
i read the entire document and saved it on file number 4
kingdom golf course purchase contract
seller
kim wan yoong hereinafter first party buyer
kingdom hereinafter second party
the purchase agreement between first and second is agreed upon as follows
what is that
is it a person
looks like they re hailing a car
should i stop
don t pay any attention and go on
what is it
no it s just that there was a bright light
did lightning strike
scared me
thank you
aigoo
i thought you were just going to pass by without seeing me but you stopped
what should i do
just keep going
why are you outside in the rain at this time
just now some lady came and talked to me
that lady really got it right as if she were a ghost
right she must be a ghost
she said even if you avoided lightning you wouldn t be able to avoid me
i guess she was right
but is this car perhaps going to seoul
yes
- no
let her off somewhere near here
yes boss
kingdom
is this you mr ceo
you felt that tingle right
no
oh there was a really strong tingle just now
it was a strong tingle wasn t it

my chance is kingdom that really big shopping mall
you see i live nearby
if you re going there -
that intersection up there looks appropriate
please get out there
yes i ll do that
just keep going please don t stop
miss
miss are you okay
yes thank you
just a moment
in the midst of the confusion of that woman screaming we happened to bring her all the way here
didn t she scream on purpose because i told her to get off
that s not what it seemed like
what did she see that made her so scared
what
you said you got into that accident after drinking
i really don t understand how you can still long for alcohol after that
no it s fine
i can t drink right now i m sorry
it s fine i haven t gotten married either
i m pretty
really
uh
pres
don t follow me go away
i told you not to follow me
he s not following me
he left
oh there are two things that i dislike
one is someone touching my money and the other is someone touching my body
i cut the flower that touched my money but what should i do with the hand that touched my body
oh i m sorry if i made you feel uncomfortable
i did it because that man who was following me scared me
i don t see anything
he was here and he was following me when i touched you like this he disappeared
but he s still listening to us my back is tingling so much
that lady ghost is she friends with that man who followed you
go have another drink with the lady and that man
right now there isn t anyone
i think it s because of you
then again i have a particular ability to get rid of annoyances that stick around
want to see
let go and stay here
don t get scared and watch closely
hey
she s following us
she s crazy
just keep going
she said even if you avoided lightning you wouldn t be able to avoid me so that s why i m here
it s not here
why isn t it here
where is it
i wish the rain would stop and the sun would shine
the marriage between soccer player yoo hae sung and top star tae yi ryeong has been the center of much attention
we will follow closely for the location and details of this couple s wedding
did you see this morning s news
there was an entertainment news report saying that
tae yi and yoo hae sung s wedding will take place at kingdom
there were exactly 15 seconds on kingdom
that s because it s a report on tae yi ryeong s wedding not an advertisement for our kingdom
if it s a wedding i sponsor for an advertisement model for my company it s a company ad
glean as much publicity as we paid for
we ll get ten times as much
speaking of which there s been a problem
an anonymous piece of mail was sent to the wedding hall
this guy is yoo hae seong
that s right
however these two people in the picture doesn t it look like they are having a wedding
if this photo isn t a fake then yoo hae seong has just found himself a past that will be quite expensive to deal with
send her an invitation
you must absolutely not send one to her
tae gong sil
this girl
if it s tae gong sil then the last name matches yours
she s pretty
were you close
we weren t close
even still invite her
my goodness
just that if you just open the can we can eat on our own
no since i m eating already let s just eat together
what about your mom
she didn t come home yesterday either
mom came back but she s busy so she went back
but the lady in 202 said noona was weird
she said you re a crazy hobo
no
it s because after a big accident in the past i became a little different from other people
even so i even tried to live normally going to work and everything
i have prepared the coffee
hey
what are you doing right now
but so many scary people found me even at work but even still there were some guys who were after me
oh my
but the scary apparitions kept getting in the way but somehow i try to live and i try to work
welcome
where shall i take you
because i don t know when i will set my eyes on those scary people following me i m always scared
it s difficult to keep going with my head held high
i wish there were at least one place in this world where i could run away and hide
get a man
my mom said that she s seeing a man because she s tired and lonely
you should do that too
a man
please don t follow me
will that man see me
this woman was the girlfriend i was with before my fame and then she abandoned me
to think she d send this even to the wedding hall
please be careful that it doesn t get leaked to the press
this woman here is malicious
if it s malicious you should cut it off
why do you live on with it
i m keeping this on out of spite
the hate for the woman who abandoned me became fuel for me to keep going
if you kept going for her to see and if you re marrying for her to see then that woman will probably come to the wedding
please pay close attention to security
the additional charge for paying extra attention will be added to your bill
this marriage is a hot issue even abroad
on the day of the wedding reporters from many different countries will be present
there will be worldwide publicity and kingdom will become a milestone of korean tourism
especially if we can attract chinese tourists by word of mouth from chinese fans kingdom s profits will skyrocket
it s an important soccer player
who are you
why are you doing this to me
so i just have to tell that soccer player about that thing that s buried under the tree
we might be able to talk if we ride the elevator
just a second
wait a minute
what are you
who are you
it s me
what s going on
it s a suspicious person
send her out
mr ceo it s me
mr ceo
ah wait a minute
we met on a rainy day
that day you were upset because i touched you
don t you remember
we even had that tingly moment in the car
i even left my clothes that day
you remember don t you
i came to meet you but i happened upon a reason to see yoo hae seong
you have to meet the ceo and you have to meet the star
you must be very busy
i m not going to meet yoo hae seong because i want to
the one who s special to me is you
if you re around me i don t have to meet that person
are you a vixen who latches on after one encounter
or are you a crazy lady who s supposed to stay at home but escapes from time to time
if it s the former i ll call a police car for you
if it s the latter i ll call an ambulance
what kind of car do you want to go home in
huh
i ve ridden in a police car and an ambulance a few times too but i don t want to ride in either of them again
then go quietly
if you keep sticking around you ll get to see a rougher method of getting around
sticking around troublesomely is really something to hate isn t it
you just make eye contact once but they creepily follow you
and they keep asking favors that have nothing to do with me
i know since i didn t like meeting those people too
i ll leave
oppa says he s in spain
hyung-nim s girl is even younger this time
oh she s pretty
i guess ceo jo doesn t resemble hyung-nim very much seeing as he doesn t have very many women around
i wonder if he doesn t have any because the ghost of that girl who died has latched onto him
do i need to do a ritual for him
i need to take a bigger part and find him a partner
it ll be difficult
haven t you heard that kingdom s master is caught in the curse of his first love
everytime ceo jo s marriage is discussed the woman s family falls into ruin gets injured or arrested
word s out that all of that s because of the curse so it ll be difficult to have a regular marriage
what do you mean curse
a curse on your nephew
i know right
curse
no it s because of his personality he has no girlfriend
he s never called me uncle
that s because you re so young dear
the stars spill out
the sun is shi - ni - ng

tomorrow will - become colder - probab - ly
resume kang woo
this is the best room we have
but are you really staying for a month
yes
if you go to the roof top you can do your laundry and exercise
the view s great too
go away
go away
are you a person
yes
you re a person
oh you re staying in room 404
since the grandmother left you ll be able to sleep well
there was a grandmother living in that room
she wasn t living there she was just there
i have lived here for a long time so if you have a problem let me know
also i m sorry if i scared you earlier i thought you weren t a person
i didn t think you were a person either
i thought you were a cat
happy and sleeping peacefully like a cat
so it was like that
why did you have to bother a sleeping cat
meow
he is good looking
that person meet him for me
let s see an intimate pose
yes good
bride lean on the groom s shoulder
after this marriage will you forego your re-entry to the european league completely
no i will be making contact with a new agency
you said you weren t going to europe
you have your injury and your age to worry about
if you go again you ll just detract from your stardom
you ll get flamed and downgraded
before i m a star i m a soccer athlete
and it s given that i want to run on a bigger stage
hae seong
people say we are the korean victoria and beckham
victoria doesn t want to encourage beckham to self-destruct
you don t have the confidence either
let s talk later
i heard there s no one seeking you out anymore
didn t your manager tell you
hyung
weren t we going to continue to search
give up
rather than imprudently heading for europe it s much safer to live here with tae yi ryeong as a star couple
forget it
if you re not going to look i ll look myself
you can t be worrying about such things right now
this came again
why are we doing this
later if you ever you get rid of me it s something to blackmail you with
what are you talking about
why would i abandon you
you keep the key
when i was with mi kyeong it was during my hardest time
i d done a lot of things that if they found out people would point fingers at me for
all my ugly past is probably in there
ah did you look for it
where is that thing
it s not there
she must have taken it out
do you think she s blackmailing me with that
don t worry
just trust me
as long as you re with me i ll take care of everything
you scared me miss
i have a favor to ask
by any chance will the president be meeting yoo hae seong
as far as i know they are scheduled to meet today
but i can t take you
i guess you can t huh
then perhaps can you give this to yoo hae seong
when yoo hae seong sees this he ll come to meet me
please deliver it to him
i wish this would end quickly so i could sleep
this must be where she kept looking out for that person
look at what
i thought he was a nice guy
what is this
i ll wait beneath the tree at sky park s central plaza
who is this face
is this girl perhaps kim mi kyeong
how do you know kim mi kyeong
she s the woman that has been threatening yoo hae seong
what do you mean threatening
that s not it
where is this girl
she isn t here right now
where did she go
she died
she died
then are you the one threatening us
no
i just wanted to relay her feelings
the whole time she has been wanting to protect and encourage him is what she said
so he knows how she really feels please give this to yoo hae seong
you can t
if she s dead that s the end
don t bother a living person
mother
ahjussi
you re that lady from last time
thanks about that
isn t this a gambling place
grandmother said not to gamble her money
mind your own business
ahjussi
how can you do this
grandmother asked you so many times not to gamble that money
i even got you that
why do you care so much about my late mother
let go
yeah
i m going around doing useless things
what s so important about what the dead have to say
no one ever even listens
oh my
get lost
don t follow me
stop bothering me
people treat me like a crazy person because of people like you
just leave me alone so i can live
are you sure you were being blackmailed by kim mi kyeong
i think you re mistaken
no it is that woman
he saw her standing outside near the office
you saw it personally
that person is dead
i ll stop her so don t get so worked up
i ll stick with you and everything will be solved
i loved her so i don t know why she s doing this to me
probably for money
is there anything a living person wants aside from money
aren t you doing this because you re afraid of losing what you have now
i m afraid of how she feels
why fear the feelings you can t see
you should be scared of the people you can
anyway i think you are going to do well
i just applied for kingdom and got in
yes i will keep watch
wow
i got the occasion to meet yoo hae seong thanks to yi ryeong
today is not tae yi ryeong s wedding day but the day we make kingdom s advertisement
we ve positioned the kingdom logo so when photographing the bride and groom there s no avoiding it
even if they can see just one hang a large one so everyone can see clearly
make it as big as the money we put in
big
yes big
kim mi kyeong
you should come too
i don t know if this is going to work or not but you ll be too pitiful if we let him keep misunderstanding
that woman even came here
why is she so keen on meeting yoo hae seong
something about relaying a dead person s feelings
get security to take care of her so she doesn t get in the way
yes
team leader the guest in the fourth camera from a-block we have orders to follow that guest
lee yeon joo watch out for the female guest passing there
meow
the cat
you can take pictures
and it s ok if you share with others that we re colleagues
thank you
you look pretty
tae gong sil is not here yet
gong sil
big sun
she s coming
tae gong sil was the big sun and you were little sun that s right
that s right
i wonder how she is now
i heard she turned really strange
why
tae gong sil did
i am friends with the bride
you re on the list
come in
confirm her
yes
that woman is a guest attending yi ryeong s wedding
she is
is she on the guest list
did you check
yes
she went to the same high school as tae yi ryeong
they call her tae gong sil
tae gong sil
so did you let her in
excuse me
who are you
this
why do you have this
the person threatening me was you
what about mi kyeong
where is mi kyeong
mi kyeong must have come with you
where is she
so you blackmail me with this and what do you want money
fine
i ll give you that money
where is mi kyeong
where is she
mi kyeong passed away
what
she was already sick when you left her
she hurt very much until she passed
you were so frighteningly mistaken so i came to tell you mi kyeong s true feelings
why isn t hae seong coming
what about hae seong
yi ryeong yoo hae seong has disappeared
what
they said he went outside for a while
did the groom possibly run away
ah
that blackmailer must have shown up
there s no way she could show up
she definitely died
ah that s not what i meant
i knew you have been blackmailing her
if you were going to do that you should have done a better job
seems like you are the one that is blackmailing him
but
what are you looking at
tae gong sil
i must have relayed your feelings wrong
you held onto your memories here all alone
i wonder how you must have felt
hae seong
i miss you
i miss you so much
let s stop here
going further is a little
mi kyeong
what are you talking about
i can t pick up after you anymore
go on by yourself
mi kyeong
mi kyeong
mi kyeong wanted to show you how she felt
just go
my life is over anyway
it s not over
you have to continue soccer okay
i know you like soccer
is that a good thing
those cleats were the first things she d ever given to you
mi kyeong
i miss you
and leaving you was the last thing she could have done for you
oppa
hae seong
i ve been waiting without ruining everything
so talk to me
i i know it s too much but i want to keep playing soccer
the woman inside my heart keeps encouraging me to
i will compensate for the damages
because of the blackmail scandal my manager agreed to take responsibility without complaint
as the dead lingers around the living person suffers in the end
though your event may have been ruined my wedding was saved
this was my real wedding
at your age and with your injury it won t be easy to return to playing in the big leagues
you will come to repeatedly regret this moment
that could happen
that is what will happen
the romance that the dead brought may have given you courage but it doesn t give you skill
i m going to enjoy watching you fail in every match
watching soccer s about to become much more enjoyable
are you cursing me
yes
so take that grudge against me and try to live well so i can see - just like you did last time
you can go
tae gong sil asked me to tell you something
please no one come to me today
i m so tired to death
i wish i could run away somewhere and sleep peacefully
don t come
go away
what did you say tae gong sil said
that the dead have no power but their feelings remain
there s someone like that for you too
joo goon do you also have someone in your heart that is dead and you cannot forget
hee joo
cha hee joo
hee joo
tae gong sil
tae gong sil
what are you saying is next to me
what do you see beside me
i m so sleepy
tell me
what is it that s beside me
i want to sleep next to you
episode 2
who are you
- i really just want to sleep
- wake up and open your eyes
- please just sleep with me
- what
are you asking me to sleep with you
with the way you look right now you re standing there asking me to sleep with you
let s sleep
i can sleep with you
i can t sleep with you
stop dreaming
you just because you keep touching me and asking me to sleep with you you think that i ll fall for you
when did you last wash your hair
if you re going to try to seduce someone try washing your hair first
it s not like you re even going to sleep with me
why did you come here
i heard that you were going around talking about me
what is it that you heard about me
or do you really know something about her
did you and hee joo know each other
that woman s name was hee joo
what is this
how do you know hee joo
i saw her
that woman i saw her
what
are you still not fully awake
- that woman - she s dead right
that s right
hee joo died a long time ago
so when and how are you saying that you saw her
i saw that woman standing next to you recently
i see dead people
the master s woman is a ghost
it s a pretty famous story at kingdom enterprises
our president joo is still living with the memories of his dead first love in his heart that s why he s still not even married
whenever he even thinks about getting married the dead woman s ghost appears and breaks up the relationship right
a dead woman are you talking about the female student that died in the car accident that was related to president joo a long time ago
that s right
that was a pretty well-known accident
i remember it being all over the news when i was younger
the rich boy and his girlfriend both were kidnapped together
it was the ten billion won kidnapping case
they lost the ransom money but never caught the culprits right
ten billion back then would be about equivalent to 100 billion won now
- 100 billion won
- billions
i m sure the guys who took that money are living very well somewhere
but
do all the employees call president joo the master joo joong won is the king of kingdom enterprises
that s why he s called the master
he also known as the tyrant
the master is living well while acting like a tyrant so it s understandable that the unfortunate girl who was kidnapped along with him would become a restless ghost from the injustice of her death
master
find me my justice
the rumor has it that she crys like that while roaming around kingdom enterprise
and because of that i can t even sleep at night
- let s toast to that cheers
there was an incident where i almost died but i somehow came back to life
ever since then i see dead people
so you re telling me that you saw hee joo who died 15 years ago the day before yesterday
that day when you got mad at me and left that s when i saw her
if she s dead then it s all over
stop pestering someone who s still alive
even though it was just for a moment i still saw her
you re telling me that you see ghosts
are there any ghosts here with us right now
how many of them are there
see that chair over there
do you see how it s rocking back and forth even though the wind isn t even blowing
so what
there s one right there
you re telling me that there s one on that chair over there
sometimes they come looking for me or they find me on the streets
i try my best to ignore them but they keep following me around
sometimes they want to talk to me
and sometimes they ask me for my help
they always cling onto me so that i can t even sleep
i m so afraid of them and can t stand having them around but i can t help myself from seeing and hearing them
but when i hold onto you like this i don t see nor hear them anymore
i ve never met someone like you
that s why you re so special to me
i wonder what you mean to me
i have a feeling that i ll be able to sleep well and live a normal life if i stay with you
i want to remain by your side
you want to be with me that badly
why don t you just tell me that you own this building then i ll look you over since this building is expensive here
i really am so miserable
you may not know what it s like since you can t hear them or see them but i m so terrified
i m not scared of something that i can t see nor hear
you re scared of this chair because it keeps on rocking
what do you think does this scare you even more now
you if you ever try to make another pass at me then i ll really destroy you
no matter what kind of scary things that you may do to me i don t think it could be any scarier than what i m looking at right now
i m just going to run away and stay right next to you
so it s not because i have an immense amount of money or because i m unbelievably good looking you want to be with me because you re afraid of ghosts
that s a very refreshing approach
it s more like a desperate approach
it s too lonely and sad for me to continue to live on like this
look here ms tae gong shil
even when that infamous girl candy makes a pass on a rich man no matter how lonely or sad she is she always ties her back hair neatly before she comes onto the man
wash that smelly head of yours and wake up to your senses
you see me as a penniless girl who s trying to seduce a rich man don t you
i m still going to do it
can t i just be your candy
just because you try do you think that you can seduce me
fine why don t you try your best to lure me with your ghost friends you perverted candy girl with your dirty hair
it s ms tae
tae gong shil
my name is ms tae ms tae translated as the sun
ms tae
if you re the sun then i never want to see the morning again
the sun is going to rise and i m going to come to stay by your side
i ll make sure to wash my hair the next time i see you
mr joo mr joo translated as the master did you get to see ms tae
i meant did you see ms tae gong shil
i never should ve came here
let s go
what was he doing here
he probably thinks that i m crazy
but i really can see them
hee joo
i really did see her too
there
there s one right there
if such things as ghosts really does exist i wish i could conjure her up just once
cha hee joo
spirit spirit
come to us
spirit spirit
come to us
spirit spirit
come to us
spirit spirit
come to us
what are they doing
they re calling eun seol s dead spirit
spirit spirit
are you here
she s here
are you
lee eun seol
it says it s eun seol
they re just joking around don t pay them any attention
why did you die
is the person responsible for your death in this room right now
tell us
is she here
we asked if the person responsible for your death is in this room right now
what are you girls doing
get back in your seats
do you think that eun seol was really here
don t respond to a prank like that
let s just study
[ lee eun seol ]
- it s eun seol - what
was this picture taken in front of our kingdom enterprise s fountain
yes
this picture is all over the internet right now
are you sure this isn t some kind of a mistake
you know how sometimes there s a glare in the picture if the camera isn t focused
but look at how all the other girls in the picture came out clearly
and don t you think that the position that the girl is standing is strange
look closely
it means that she was standing right here when this picture was taken
yes i see
i doubt that she went into the water to get in the picture
then does it mean that it really is a ghost
if this picture is real then it means that she s a poltergeist
what do you mean a picture of a poltergeist
- how does that even make any sense
- i tested it myself unless she really is a ghost it would ve been impossible for her to have been in that picture
i m sure that it was fabricated
our company image is already in trouble after tae yi ryung s wedding got called off and now we ve got this garbage to deal with too
vice president is this how you manage things around here
i did make a request for the picture to be deleted off the website
no matter this incident has put kingdom enterprise at the top of the search site
kingdom s poltergeist and kingdom s ghost
all the employees are talking about how exciting it is to have a ghost on our premise
you find this funny
you find this situation to be exciting
well the ghost is pretty scary but it s kind of fascinating too
this is no time to be fascinated with ghosts right now
a giant mall that s going to stand in the path of kingdom s success is going up floor by floor each day
they re going to be opening in two months
a giant that s even scarier than a ghost is rising up in front of our very own eyes
there s only two months left
they sure built it fast
you need to get your head on straight if you don t want to be out of a job in two months tell the employees not to be lured by the ghost story tell them to lure in the customers
make them open up their wallets and spend their money their money
i know a guy who works at a tv station
should i submit this to him
i heard they give out prizes if the story gets picked up
sir this picture is mine she s my ghost
mine
you are being so absurd
okay fine
[ seeking part time employees ]
- hi - oh my goodness
gong shil
what are you doing out in the middle of the day instead of sleeping
- did you come here to see me
i i just got a job at kingdom enterprises
what
gong shil it hasn t been that long since i became a manager here if you get hauled off by the police or taken away in an ambulance
i won t be able to work here gong ri that may not happen here
because i ve got something special here
why you don t see those things when you re here
i have a place that i could run off to so that i don t see those things
but why are you drinking two cups of coffee
it s because you re too sleepy staying awake during the day isn t it no it s not
some kid keeps following me around telling me that he wants some coffee i ordered one for him too
gong ri i m going to get going
hey
hey gong shil
this is the picture that we took on the day that eun seol died isn t it
yeah
but why is dead eun seol in this picture
do you think that the dead eun seol sent this to us
to show us that she hates us
i m sure that someone s just playing a prank
some kids are saying that eun seol died because of us
it was a car accident
it wasn t because of us
the truth is i think it is our fault that she s dead
if we hadn t done what we did to her that day she probably wouldn t have died
i think that eun seol is still with us because she hates us
who is this supposed ghost in the picture
rumor has it that it s the girl who died awhile back because of president joo
that s just absurd
- who s going around saying things like that
i m saying that s what the employees are saying to themselves
everyone knows about that incident because it was so well-known they always said that president joo has that girl s spirit attached to him
that girl died a very long time ago
is that image of the ghost really the same girl
i do remember her having long hair
and i think she was around the same age as these girls when she died
but i can t remember what her face looked like
it s understandable that your memories would falter at your age
i heard this is where the ghost was seen
- a ghost
let s try taking a picture
okay let s see
is that poltergeist picture still causing a lot of talk
even though the vice president and his team are trying to take care of it but stories like this isn t going to be easy to quiet down
and on top of everything else there s an absurd rumor going around too
what is the additional absurd rumor that s now going around
the thing is
- what the heck
i m soaking wet - are you okay
come on and get back up here
i shouldn t have got on this ghost fountain
sorry
ghost fountain
do they even know how expensive this fountain is
there are four goddesses pillars in that fountain
so you re telling me that those goddesses are being pushed out by a single ghost
a scary ghost is more shocking than beautiful goddesses
beauty helps people feel relaxed but fear keeps them nervous
they have the ability to keep them drawn in so that they can t help but stare and wonder
i m sure that s why people are lured in by such stories
how truly shocking and frightening
what do you think you re doing
what are you doing here
i m cleaning
i just got hired here
i m sure that there are plenty of other places that needs cleaning so why of all places are you here cleaning
because you re here
you really are pulling out all the moves
when a woman is trying to seduce a rich man she always starts by getting a job where she can be seen by him
use the job as an excuse to lock gazes and share their meals together at times
is that what you were thinking
i know that you don t believe me but you know that s not what i m expecting from you
ah you said it s because of the ghosts didn t you
ghosts
i heard that there s ghost here
did you come here to see your friend
you say there s a ghost here
no there isn t
there isn t
no there isn t
if there was a ghost i m sure that i would ve grabbed onto you
there really isn t one
are you sure
that s what i thought
this fountain is way too expensive for a ghost to be hanging around in
yes i m positive that there aren t any ghosts
that s a relief
president joo so you believe me now
right you believe me now don t you
believe what it s a given that there aren t any ghosts
it s not because i believe you but it s because there are no such things as ghosts
and you i don t want you cleaning here
why not
it s also a given for me to kick you out of here
get lost ms tae
president joo
president joo
we ve got a problem
i don t know how the tv station got ahold of it but that poltergeist picture is being broadcasted on their news today
why would a picture that some kids fabricated be broadcasted on the news
the rumors just kept on spreading until the story blew up
i think the incident from your past got mixed into the rumor that s floating around
there s a picture that s been floating around all over the internet lately
an image of a young girl s face can be seen behind these brightly smiling girls
a picture which catches the image of a ghost like you see in this picture is what we call a poltergeist picture
in that case who is the girl in this picture
while investigating the mystery within this picture we were able to unearth a terrifying link between the location where this picture was taken and a tragic incident from the past
do you remember the ten billion won kidnapping case that shook the nation in its wake 15 years ago
mr joo was kidnapped along with his girlfriend while the police were staking out the culprits who were making their ransom demands his girlfriend who was kidnapped along with him lost her life in this extremely tragic case
the kidnapped young mr joo is the current ceo of the shopping mall that this poltergeist picture was taken from
there is a very peculiar rumor floating around the mall
the ghost of president joo s ex-girlfriend haunting this mall is a rumor that all of us employees have already known about
i don t know if it s because of that but security at night can get pretty eerie and to be honest all the female employees that we have at the mall
the ghost of the dead ms cha who s rumored to haunt the grounds of this mall
that s not the same girl that i saw
one of our writers went to visit the detective who was in charge of that accident
the statute of limitation for that case is expiring soon
since we closed the case without having caught the perpetrators i m sure that the dead victim has more than enough reason for her to feel angry
who could the girl in this picture be
could it be the ghost of the late ms cha
or could it be just a prank that someone is trying to pull
but one thing is certain the place where this picture was taken roams a spirit of a young girl who died too young before her time
excuse me
it s not her
the girl in the picture isn t cha hee joo who lingers by your side
there seems to be some sort of a mistake don t you think
shut up and get out of my way
you saw that on tv right
they said that this is just a ghost that s always been around kingdom enterprises
but you know that s eun seol
we all know that
should we go there
what were you thinking giving that interview and getting involved in such absurdity
the statute of limitation for that case is going to expire soon i was hoping that the interview would bring some new piece of information on the case
did you think that shocking people with that ghost story was going to scare the perpetrators into turning themselves in or something
if the perpetrators saw that i m sure they would ve felt some sense of guilt
in some ways cha hee joo died because of you
don t you feel the least bit sorry to her
you seem to be living a very nice life as the president of kingdom enterprises
of all people shouldn t you be the one that never forgets her
you seem to hate me because i ended up living a normal and nice of a life
forget the past the living must go on living
all i ve done is not forget those words that you told me 15 years ago and i m living the way that you told me to live
did i say that
anyways i m never going to give up on this case
in that case my money that you lost make sure you get that back for me as well
is it that you re truly okay with all this
you experienced a post traumatic disorder after that incident didn t you
can you read about it now
i m all better now
so you re not really well and living the good life are you
i wonder who this is
didn t you say that she s a ghost
i wonder if she really is the spirit of some dead girl
didn t you say that you see those people
can t you just search for her
that s true
if i can find her then i could help her
and maybe if i help her she may be able to stay with them right
is your mom not coming home again tonight
no i guess she s too busy earning money
okay then eat as much as you want and sleep in my bed when you get sleepy
even if she seems weird we have to act like we believe her
that way she will continue to feed us
here eat
i saw a few while i was cleaning
excuse me can you show me your face
i m sorry but i don t think you re the one
by any chance have you seen this girl
um can you please just take a closer look
it s the girl who was hanging out around the fountain over there
they never listen when i tell them to go away
so why would they answer me when i m asking them something
i m so sleepy
are you human
what are you doing sitting there like a thieving cat
ah it s room 404
ah i forgot you told me that you work here
when i saw you from the security room i noticed that you kept wandering around
i m one of the cleaners here
i started working here a few days ago
but the cleaning team are already all gone for the day
i lost something while i was cleaning so i was just walking around to see if i could find it
i m just going to go look around some more
i ll come with you
no it s okay
but it s too scary for you to go around in the dark by yourself
there s that rumor about the ghost roaming around here too
i ll walk around with you
let s go since there aren t any people around
what if eun seol shows up
then let s ask her
let s ask her why she s tormenting us
so what is it that you re looking for
it s not something that you can see
my vision is very good
you still won t be able to see it no matter how good your sight is
it s not you
my name is kang woo
kang woo
and my name is tae gong shil
you can hold onto me if you re scared
thank you
eun seol we came to see you
we have something to tell you
are you here
over there - they re people
- yes you re right
they look like young female students
what are those four girls doing over there
there are only three
hey girls
what are you doing down there
girls
is it you
things would get a lot more complicated if we are caught
we never should ve come here
it s you three isn t it
this place hasn t changed a bit and looks exactly the same as it did 15 years ago
the reason why you came all the way down here is it because you re bothered by the fact that the statute of limitation is almost expired
did you really not see any of their faces when you were held captive 15 years ago
no i didn t see them
i guess if you had seen their faces i m sure you would ve ended up just like miss cha
that s true
it s because she knew who the perpetrators were that she died
is it true that kingdom is cursed
no that s just absurd
i heard that the reason why my wedding was broken off is because kingdom is cursed
no it wasn t a curse it was a change in his heart
yoo hye sung i m going to put a curse on him
but the girl who brought the stuff from hye sung s ex-girlfriend to shake him up like that do you still not know who that was
my husband said he saw her
once he finds out who it was i ll make sure to reprimand her for you
tell me who it is first
because i ll take care of her myself
to see the sun first thing in the morning when i wake up is offensive enough but now as soon as i come to work i have to see your face
i told you to quit working here didn t i
i figured it out
figured what out
the ghost in that picture i found out who that girl is
who is she
but if i tell you who it is will you allow me to continue to work here
but if you re wrong you re going to end up cleaning up the floors in a lockup
that seat over there is that girl s desk
her name was lee eun seol and she was a student here who died a month ago
and those three girls over there they were lee eun seol s friends
they came to the fountain late last night
then i bet those girls are responsible for it
is this really you three
eun seol was your friend why did you play a prank like this
we didn t do it
it was just a picture that we took of ourselves and eun seol s image got captured in it too
and it was dead eun seol who sent this picture to us
she s just trying to torment us
stop with this absurd ghost story just tell the truth of what you three have done
you are tormenting her dead soul just like you did when she was still alive
that s why you pulled this prank isn t it
we never tormented her
eun seol was the one who always ruined everything and made things difficult for us
- hey
- hey
you should ve been more careful
what are we going to do now our grades were going to be based on that
what are you going to do about it now
i m so sorry you guys i feel so awful
she was always so ignorant and clumsy and she was always a nuisance whenever she was around us
hey guys i ll buy the drinks
hey lee eun seol
you re only buying for drinks again
i m sorry but i m a little short on my allowance lately
here apple orange and lemon
each of your favorites
this looks so good
she always mooched off of us and she d only pay for the drinks we still didn t say anything to her
lee eun seol was nothing but a nuisance
so you killed lee eun seol because she was a nuisance and fabricated this story about her becoming a ghost
she didn t die because of us
that day when our midterm grades were ruined because of what lee eun seol did we were all so annoyed with her
that s why we all decided to just hang out by ourselves without her but she was too dense to realize that and followed us there
we just want to hang out by ourselves today
what i said we just want to hang out by ourselves
you should just get going now if you re done with us here
ah that s right i forgot i have something else that i needed to do
i have some things to do so i need to get going
have fun
ga young don t you think that was a little too rude
she s so dense that being straight with her is the only way she ll understand
can you take a picture of us
one two three
this is the picture that the three of us took
but eun seol sent us this other picture
that s the day eun seol got into the car accident on her way back home
that must be why eun seol cursed us and sent us that picture
i m not going to go easy on you just because you shed a few tears
if the picture was sent to you by her cellphone then i m sure it was sent by the person who has her cellphone
since it was eun seol s cellphone i m sure it was eun seol who sent it
it wasn t eun seol
it wasn t eun seol who cursed you out of her hatred for you
you have eun seol s cellphone don t you
excuse me
i know that you found eun seol s cellphone when she lost it that day
i know that you still have it so hand it over
it was you
you re the one who pulled this prank
how could you do this
do you know how shocked and scared we were
i did it to shock and scare you guys
because you guys were so hateful
who do you think you are
on the day that eun seol died i saw the three of you with eun seol
orange apple and lemon
okay
lee eun seol
it came out so pretty
you know how dense lee eun seol is
what if she comes back with drinks in hand no kidding
i wouldn t put it past her i don t think i d be strong enough to tell her to go away
let s make this picture our new profile picture let s call ourselves the three musketeers and put it up as our profile picture
so that she can t try to butt in
okay
let s go
that s how lee eun seol died
how is that our fault
that was just a car accident she used up all the money she had for her bus fare to buy those drinks for you guys she died on her way walking back home
and watching the way the three of you acted after she died you guys were just so hateful
lee joo yeon you placed first in class again didn t you
kim ga young you got yourself a new boyfriend
and ha hyo jin i heard that you re taking special treatments to help you grow taller isn t that right
i did it to make you guys suffer you guys seemed so unaffected
ever since eun seol s ghost appeared you haven t been able to study you haven t been able to date and you seem to actually have been shrinking
you re feeling guilty because you know you did something wrong
what do you think you girls are doing
this isn t what eun seol wanted
keep your mouth shut
the living are just trying to survive
it s not something the dead should get involved in
did you check it out
i saw that it s not my fault
a very strong proof of it
excuse me
forget it all that matters is that i found out whatever it is that i need to know
i m not curious to know how you found out about it
i know because i can see
eun seol is so sad
i think i need to let her friends know that
do you think that what we did was that bad
enough to be cursed for it
she said that eun seol died because of us
because she hated us
what do we do now
it s not like we can even apologize to someone who s already dead
[ i really am with you guys right now ]
[ i ll listen if there s anything that you guys want to tell me ]
it s eun seol i thought that lady took eun seol s phone earlier
then this is
it s eun seol
let s just think that it s eun seol
i m sorry
i m so sorry
i m sorry too
i used to think that you were annoying
i treated you so badly
i m sorry
i m so sorry
i wish that you could just smile at us and tell us that it s okay like you used to
apple orange and lemon
apple
orange
lemon
my friends
it s okay
eun seol
i m sorry eun seol i m sorry
what do you think ms tae is looking at right now
she s just staring off into space
is that how it looks to you
for some reason i can t help but look at ms tae as she stares at something that we can t see
let s go wait
- what about ms tae
- i m sure she ll just go away
are you going to keep the promise you made her about not kicking her out
so can i continue to clean here
yes
i m too busy of a man to care about the management of the cleaning crew that s what he told me
then would it be okay for me to go thank him myself
make sure that nothing unsavory happens on the fourth floor where my office is that s what he also told me
he doesn t want you to come up there
why do you look so disappointed
he s going to have to come down here anyways
yes you re right
um what s going to happen to those girls
are they going to be punished for fabricating that picture
he decided to just let it go
i thought that he was really angry with that whole ghost story
he s actually very happy at the moment because of that whole ghost story
a rumor has spread that the fountain is haunted by a ghost who grants people their wish and people are just flocking over to it
take a look look at how much coin has piled up in the past few days
maybe i ll throw one in there myself
hey kiddo
do you want to make a wish too what s your wish
i want a new toy and a new pair of running shoes
really
i ll give you this coin so go stand in front of your mom and shout out your wish in a loud clear voice
your wish will come true if you go up to the kids mall up there on the second floor
- go on
- mom i have a wish i want to make
most people s wishes are just a form of one s desires
as long as it results in a rise in my profit i don t care if it s a goddess or a ghost advertise it let people know their wishes will be granted
i m just going to bury the fabricated photo incident
why
because of that ruse the story about your past came back to light
the bigger deal i make of it the bigger this story is going to get but if i just quietly bury the story then it s just going to go away
can you put it away
are you still not letting anyone into your life because you still think that you re responsible for her death
do you still feel that guilty about it
joong won
yes i know i know what you re going to say i ve already heard it more than a thousand times
the ultimate excuse that a living person can make
that the living must go on living
that s right the living must go on living
i know that very well myself so stop giving me that advice
the fact alone that i m still alive and well is a testament that it s not my fault that s what i m afraid others will think
i know that s how you also view me right now
- it s just that i m worried about you
- yes i know
you don t need to worry
one thing that i can tell you with absolute certainty is that i never not even for a single moment thought that it was my fault
is that the spirit of a young girl who died too young still roams around this earth
don t you even feel the least bit sorry to her
do you still feel that guilty
you didn t see the perpetrator s face at all
cha hee joo
are you okay
what s going on here
are you okay
joong won
i m sorry for all of this
joo joong won
because you ended up dying like that it put me in a very unfair position
cha hee joo
this incident had nothing to do with that other incident
but there s someone in joo joong won s vicinity that s causing me some concern
it s a woman
hey new girl
you said your name is ms tae right
how old are you
new girl why don t you tell us a little about yourself
no i don t want to
excuse me
ma am
isn t today your father-in-law s memorial
that s right
oh my gosh i had completely forgotten about it
i should get home early today
but ms tae how did you know about that
i just i thought that i heard you speak of it earlier
thanks
i m going to have to rush
i think that there s something strange going on here
should i do an exorcism
- wait that woman
- woman
no that lady over there
i think it s that lady from that other day - who
- the girl that ruined tae yi ryung s wedding
really
tae gong shil
i ll remember that
ms tae gong shil
are you going to be done soon
yes we re almost finished here
then why don t we go home together
excuse me
we both live at the same place
so let s go home together
i ll wait for you outside
- oh my goodness
- are you two dating
- do you two live together
- you guys are already living together
when did you two get married
- oh my
- must be nice
- they re already living together
- are you living with him
he wants me to go home with him
do you see something again excuse me
do you see something again around my expensive fountain
no i don t see anything
don t show yourself anywhere near me
excuse me
what is it
why are you talking to me
um i m sorry for everything
had i known that there was that kind of pain i wouldn t have told you that i saw that woman cha hee joo hovering around you
pain
i just brought up the old memories and guilt for nothing right
guilt
i m sure that she was standing beside you to tell you to forget the past and that the living must go on living
it wasn t your fault
the thing that you say you can see can you conjure it up
why
if you can conjure her up then do it
i have something that i have to tell her
what s that
you re a bitch
subtitles by dramafever
[ next episode preview ]
your useless senses that no one else can see is absurd
get lost
- president joo
- oh my goodness
- please open the door
- i m not going to open it
get lost
that s my shoe
my shoe
she followed me like this
you really are crazy aren t you
- those tears are a lie
- tae gong shil don t ever show up again
- joong won
- you re a bitch
- joong won
- what are you
it s me
the bitch that you hate
you re a bitch
- did you just swear - that s right
relay it just like that
relay this message to the ghost that you see
you must blame her a lot for leaving you behind all alone
so you liked her that much
enough to swear at her
if i happen to see her again i ll relay it to her i ll tell her that you still like her a lot
don t twist things around in your head
it s an insult just like how it sounds
- you re a bitch
- i know
she s a bad person a very bad person that s what they all say when they miss someone very much
no that s not right
if you re going to relay it to her like that then just get lost ms tae
but it still makes me so happy to know that you believe me
no i don t believe you
so don t be happy
i ve been so lonely and scared all this time
meeting you was like a ray of sunshine
you have no idea how reassuring it is to know that i have a place to escape to whenever i get scared
that s not right either
you re telling me that i m your place of escape
go ahead and try knocking on my door
i will never open my door to you
please open it
- no i won t open never
- you re the only form of escape that i have
i m just so scared
please open up for me
episode 3
it s a designer brand
what is this doing here
is there only one shoe
i wonder if the lost and found department is still open
give it back
give it back
- that was
- i heard it too
are you okay
- yes
- what happened
i tripped on something up there
what s going on here
hi kang woo
she said she fell down the stairs
can you try moving your foot
it hurts a little
i didn t see anything up there that you could ve tripped on
i m positive that there was something up there
the floor is slippery the floor is still waxy
the cleaning team needs to re-clean the floors - right now
- right now
team leader kang woo can take deputy ahn to the hospital
yes i understand
i guess we won t be able to go home together tonight
i have to clean up around here too please take her to the hospital safely
then i ll see you at home
yes i ll see you at home
- kang woo and i live
- forget it i m not curious to know
deputy ahn said that she has some files that she needs to get to the vice president
i think i need to go get them from her
go ahead
i can get myself home - will you be alright
- of course
that startled me
what is this
have i never driven this car before
here i thought i was going to go home like the rest of the normal people
it s a shoe
it s so pretty
i want to go on dates with men wearing shoes like these
i wonder if the other shoe is around
sear ch home
okay i got it
i figured it out i figured it out
you did good
you did good
president joo
please open the door
- please open the door
- i m not opening it - get lost
- president joo
what is it
what is it that you re getting so worked up about
master
this is huge
thank you
what did you do with your other shoe
and what s with the shoe in your hand
the owner of this shoe is chasing after me
the owner of this shoe must be dead
it seems that she died instantly at the moment of impact
you think it was drunk driving she must ve been pretty out of her mind to drive with only one shoe on take a look
- please pull your skirt down
- excuse me
what are you doing
mind your own business and go away
please stop what you re doing
if you continue i will have you arrested
i know you
how could you have manhandled me like that
anyone would agree that your behavior looked very suspicious this is my car
i need to buy something but my manager isn t around right now
when i looked down from my hospital room i noticed that the sunroof was left open so i came down here to get some money
that round container in there
i have my money in there my money
that s what i was trying to get
- that s what you need
- yeah
- there s only 1 000 won in here - huh
really
what is it that you need
two bottles of soju one dried squid and one dried cuttlefish
did i get it right
you even had the squid grilled how very sensible of you
if you can handle drinking two bottles of soju by yourself why are you staying at the hospital
fine i m faking it
i m doing it because i was stuck in a jam and i had no other choice
why
- are you going to tell the reporters
- no
i understand that you were stuck in a jam
are you pitying me right now
if you re pitying me because i was left at the altar then don t do it
aren t you doing all this so that you could gain people s pity just tell me what your number is
i ll send you the money for this
no forget it
i hope that the soju will be a better remedy for you than your hospital stay
did he just refuse my offer to exchange numbers how nonsensical
- are you choi yoon hee s husband
- yes
is that my wife
i m sorry but she didn t make it
yoon hee
are you sure that the woman who died is in there right now yes
should we go
you
are you really going to go in there like that
i don t have my other shoe
it s actually rather cushy and comfortable because there are still some tissues left in there
i m not talking about your sense of action but i m talking about how you look
aren t you even embarrassed
no it s okay
there was a time when i got so scared at the bathhouse that i just ran out of there and had to go home wearing a cardboard box
so something like this doesn t embarrass me at all let s go
you
if the owner of that shoe isn t in there you re going to admit yourself in this hospital with that tissue box on your foot
i really don t like coming here unless i absolutely have to
where are you saying the owner of that shoe is
there
now that you ve seen with your own eyes do you believe me imagine how scared i am all the time
i m telling you that ghosts really do exist doesn t that scare you
no i m not scared
what does it matter when i don t see them myself
i don t use my imagination on useless stuff
i m telling you she chased after me like this
- don t do that
- don t do what - she appeared out of nowhere like this
- don t do that
okay fine i bet it s scary for you
but when i hold onto you like this i don t see them anymore
can you now understand why i m always hanging onto you
joong won doesn t let just anyone get close to him
he s calculating the feasibility and the fit of the type of women that he wants to be with and he won t relegate himself to spend his time with anyone he doesn t deem worthy
and just like anything else he does with his life and business he s rather picky
so what you re telling me is that you don t think that he s distancing himself away from women because of hee joo
in other words it means that he has yet to meet a woman who ll be beneficial to his business
since he has a calculator for a brain i m sure he ll make the right choice
but there are those rare people who just can t be figured out with normal calculations
it s not because of your money or your good looks it s because i can see ghosts
i m not a candy girl who s out to seduce you
are you a christian
sixth sense or intuition are you telling me you have that
yes it s unexpected isn t it
i thought you were some gold digger but it s just your intuition
if the reason why you stick yourself to me is because of those ghosts i mean those beings then what s the reason for those being hanging onto you like that
they come to ask me to do things for them
they re not like living people who can formally explains their situations and asks you for your help
they always show up out of nowhere to tell me what they want me to know and they keep coming around me until i do what they want me to do and torment me to the point where i can t even get any sleep
what is it that the owner of that shoe wants from you
she wants me to give this shoe to her husband
she told me to tell him that she ll be watching over him
that man probably is the shoe owner s husband right
i know that guy
he s one of the shop owners at kingdom
really
then she must ve lost her shoe when she came to see her husband
this must be very special to him
she s dead
i m telling you she s dead
this truly is a miracle
she took it upon herself and died
the way her husband was smiling was even scarier than the ghost herself
when i got so scared earlier and ran away i forgot to take one of my shoes in my haste to run away from the ghost
that s what it must ve been like for her
what do you think it was that she saw when she left her shoe and ran away
i don t use my imagination on useless things
i have a feeling that she saw something that made her very angry and upset
she s dead
i m telling you she s dead
this truly is a miracle
she took it upon herself and died
if i told him that his dead wife was watching over him then i bet he wouldn t be laughing like that right
let s go
okay good luck with that
go find out what injustice he did to her and get revenge for her too
where are you going
you have to come with me - why would i
- i can t go back there without you
i m scared of her i don t know what other ghosts may come up to me
- i need you - ah
i m your special shield isn t that right
you said that you can t see them when you re touching me right
you said you want to run to me and cling onto me when you re scared
but by any chance do they ever give you any useful information
like what the stock market is going to be like in the morning or where i can dig to find all the oil or where are all the countless numbers of lost treasure chests buried at and if nothing else do they tell you what the next lottery winning numbers will be
then i don t need you
your intuition that only sees and hears useless things holds no value to me zero
but let me give you one piece of advice based on what i ve seen and heard here
because you go around doing what you do in other people s eyes you re just a crazy woman walking around with that tissue box on your foot
someone who doesn t even know how to be embarrassed
get your head on straight and just worry about yourself
president joo you know that i m not crazy
- you saw it for yourself and believe me
- no i m only going to see what i want to see and believe only in what i want to believe in
i m just going to see you as a crazy woman and i m not going to believe anything you say
seriously
do you know what s going to happen with the stocks tomorrow
can you even tell me what the winning lottery numbers are
you can t even tell me anything
why don t you let me know some of these things before you ask me for my help
2 000 won
again
what s this
i did have the shoes
it is sturdy
nice and cushy too
they don t seem bad to wear
what is this
it fell apart
it fell apart what do i do
all the tissues are falling out
tae gong shil
kang woo
what are you doing here
i m on my way home after dropping deputy ahn off at the hospital
i was at the hospital too
is she okay
yes
- what s that - this
i lost my shoe
i look like a crazy person walking around like this don t i
wearing a tissue box to protect your foot is a proof that you re a quick thinker
right
i wore it because i had to
i m not wearing it because i m crazy
but it s falling apart and i don t know what to do
what do i do
i think that tissue box is dead now after having completed its mission
i think we need to call in some reinforcements
i see a taxi heading this way why don t we share it
my defense line is wounded but i found myself some new reinforcements
no nothing
you re diverting from your path
i know
be quiet
i shouldn t have seen those
but did she sprint home with the tissue box on her foot
where did she go
you re diverting from your path i got it
i m just going to go on my own
turn right
what is this right turn again
then it wasn t the right place earlier
your wife was driving with only one shoe on her foot i thought she was drunk driving but she wasn t
- is there a problem
- no i just thought that it was weird that she was driving while wearing only one shoe
kim
is he saying that something bad happened to my daughter which caused the accident
please calm down mother-in-law
i m sure she must ve lost her other shoe somewhere
i ll look for it
did you look for the shoe you didn t find it
okay
thanks for bringing me back home
if you re thankful would it be okay for me to ask you something
what is it
the special person at kingdom enterprises that you spoke of the last time is it president joo joong won
yes
is he also the reason why you started working at kingdom
well yes
i saw that he came all the way here to visit you the other day do you two have a special relationship
i wanted to know if it s okay for us to be coming home together like this
we wouldn t be able to do that if you re his special woman
i m not that kind of a special woman
to president joo i m just a crazy woman
then let s continue to go home together like this
thanks for everything today
who is that man
he s the team leader of the security team at kingdom enterprises
- and he lives in room 404
- yeah
does that man know about your mental state
if he knew i doubt he d suggest going home together after work
gong shil the reason you re like this
may be because you lack energy
why don t you get closer to that guy and charge up some of your energy my energy
you see it all the time in period dramas
when a righteous woman sleeps with a man she is said to have dirtied her energy and kicked out of her household
the fact that you see those things could be a sign of weak energy
who knows maybe if you receive some of a man s energy things might get better
maybe you re right
i wonder if that man is special to me because he has really strong energy
that man who would that be
- there s just someone
- whoever it is just let him give it to you
suck him of his energy okay
how am i to do that when he won t even let me touch him
let s suck on 404 s energy for now
hurry up and go to sleep
you have to get to work in the morning so that you can come home with him tomorrow
i can t go to sleep
what if i fall too deep in sleep and have it taken from me like the last time
is something in here right now
our summer revenue figures are doing great kingdom is really climbing up
giant mall will be opening soon
we need to come up with a plan of attack to make sure that they don t defeat us
this store has the third highest revenue volume in this place
hello
the revenue in this shop isn t all that great let s just keep going
this store has the highest revenue volume - president joo
- hello thank you for all your hard work
if there s anything that you ever need please don t hesitate to ask me
- yes
- but please keep up your great work thank you so much
that poster was made when we thought yi ryung was going to marry the soccer player
do you think it s still okay to be hanging that up now that the wedding is off
look at how fierce it looks
that poster is going to be a great piece of advertisement
i don t think that tae yi ryung is going to like this
we ve already paid her for the modeling fee
even if she doesn t like it what can she do about it
i like it
[ temporarily closed ]
she said this was the place
the owner of this shop s wife died in an accident a few days ago
yes i know
this shop is our fourth highest revenue grossing store
i think that giant mall has approached him about opening up a store at their mall but i doubt he ll make his move over there since he signed a contract with me
i ve seen something that makes it difficult for me to trust him
look into him some more
look into it
that shop owner s wife did you hear that she died last week
i heard that he was so devoted to his wife
that s too bad
i ve seen that couple too
i saw that couple here on a date and they were planning on taking a hiking trip somewhere on their day off
the husband seemed so kind
the wife is extremely rich she even opened up that shop for him so of course he should be nice to her
i heard that his mother-in-law is even richer
i heard that she owns a few buildings in gangnam
then let s think about this
her one and only daughter is dead and the only person she has left is her son-in-law
then all her money will go to the son-in-law
he s hit the jackpot - awesome
- he s hit the mother load
anyways he s a nice man who was really good to his wife
so i guess he deserves the money
- gong shil
- gong ri if i m the only person who says he s bad when everyone else thinks he s a good person then no one would believe me right
did you did you see something again
no
gong shil
let s stay here for a while and try to make a life here
you have to do well so that you can continue to go home with that man and you can receive his energy too
okay
i m sorry gong ri i m going to get going
bye
i always feel like there s something lurking whenever gong shil stops by
is someone there
go away
- go go away
- by any chance is that woman your little sister
yes she is why do you ask
it s just that i want to become friends with her
let me help you clean this up i don t know why these things fell down
doesn t he have any sympathy how could he have hung these up when she had to be admitted in the hospital
let s go protest this right now
- this is it
- what in the world is this
it s not bad
rather than getting pitied while dressed in hospital gowns being seen dressed like this while kicking that ball seems to suit me better
are you really okay with this
i like it
since we re already here should we find out who the woman that ruined my wedding was
- let s think about it over lunch
tae gong shil why
is she someone you know
no it can t be her no way
um
yes
- are you doing okay
- yes
i can t take a day off of work over a small injury like this
um you said you tripped on something when you fell down the stairs the other night
by any chance did you see this shoe when you fell the other night
that s the same shoe that i picked up in the hallway that night
where did you picked it up from
my yoon hee
so did you come from that way
no
that way
so you fell down like this when the shoe came off
she told me that the shoe was found right here
this is very close to her husband s shop
that s where the shoe was
then that s just garbage and you re the cleaning crew
throwing trash away in the trash can is part of your job
you know that this isn t trash
you know exactly what i m trying to do here
no i don t know
in my eyes you re an employee at the risk of getting fired for your strange behaviors and for being lazy enough to sprawl yourself on the ground like this
those shoes
don t they look like the same pair of shoes as this one to you
right aren t they the same
so what
even if i keep denying it and say that i don t want to know i can t just ignore it when i see it
that s just how i am
again again again
i just saw something that i shouldn t have seen
honey do you have to go hiking with your wife again on your next day off
i have to keep going with her so that no one will suspect me when she has an accident
does your wife like to go hiking
yeah she likes it
since she has no idea that she s looking around for her death spot
honey
yoon hee
yoon hee
hear me out
honey
so you re wearing those shoes out in the open now
your wife is dead
i haven t been able to wear them because i was afraid of getting caught wearing the same shoes
but there s no risk of that happening now
be careful
my mother-in-law is still alive
once that old lady is dead who do you think is going to get all this
she still looks perfectly healthy
who knows when she ll die
she s not doing so well since the death of her daughter
it ll be soon enough
we ve got the luck on our side
giant mall is eyeing all our high revenue grossing stores for their own
we have to protect our stores
you went around and met with everyone today
my mouth feels like it s about to rip from all the smiling that i had to do
but it was important for you to go see them since they produce all that revenue for us
i don t know if my mouth feels like it s going to rip from all the useless things i ve seen
the woman that tae gong shil went after earlier is the employee at the dahlia shop
i heard that the owner of that shop recently lost his wife and has sunken into despair
it worries me that ms tae may do something wrong
mother-in-law what are you doing here you should be at home resting
yoon hee s no longer around to take care of you now
so i brought you some food for you to eat
mother it s only the two of us now
we need to lean on each other
would you like to go hiking around the mountains just like how yoon hee and i used to go to together
- that s
- she wants me to give you this shoe
this belonged to your late wife
this belonged to my yoon hee
she came here right before she got into that accident she came here to see her husband and she ended up seeing the awful things that her husband was doing
she was so shocked and flustered that she lost her shoe along the way
ji sung what is she talking about you re saying that my wife came here
no she didn t
and that shoe didn t belong to my wife
don t lie
i have no idea what she s talking about
mother-in-law i already found yoon hee s shoe
what
the police brought it to me and told me that they found it at the scene of the accident
this is my wife s shoe
no it s not
that shoe belongs to another woman
and that woman is in here right now who are you
what is it that you re after why are you doing this to us
she told me that she would be watching over you
she told me that she has to protect you he s a bad man
look here
why are you doing this to us
it hasn t even been a week since my wife died
i wish i could follow her in her death
i can t even follow her in her death because i have to go on living so why in the world are you doing this to us
could you still say the same thing if your wife was here watching over you right now
if my wife was watching then she d know just how much i loved her and how i m suffering without her right now she d know all that
that s a lie
- those tears are a lie
- lady what are you doing
- have you lost your mind
- i saw everything
i saw you laughing at the hospital
- and i can see that you re lying
- you need to get out of here
- aren t you even sorry
- please leave
ma am that man is a bad person
- your daughter wants to protect you
- get out of here
team leader
the woman causing trouble at dahlia shop is a member of the cleanup crew by the name of tae gong shil
tae gong shil
- that man is lying he s a bad person - what are you doing
- ma am wait that woman
- he s a bad man
- please stop this - let go of me
- it really was tae gong shil
the big sun who everyone said was prettier and smarter than you
i heard that she s gotten really weird and i guess the rumor was true
she s completely ruined
- that grandmother is in danger
- this woman is crazy
excuse me you re a security guard right get this woman out of here
is she crazy
did you see what she did in there earlier
let s go mother
tae gong shil
why are you sitting down there like some crazy person get up
i said get up
did you find the owner of that shoe yes
over there
i did find her but he s lying and telling everyone that the shoe doesn t belong to his wife
it s not a lie
this is my late wife s shoe
that woman is talking some absurd and crazy gibberish
then we ll just see if this woman is crazy or if you re the one lying
this is the shoe that your wife was wearing when she died
i picked it out of the trash after you threw it away at the hospital
- the size of the shoes doesn t match
- oh my goodness you re right
your shoe doesn t match
these are a perfect match
you re telling me that these are yoon hee s shoes
then what was the shoe that you had
- bring that woman out here
- yes
oh my goodness look at her shoe
the shoe that you lied about to keep the truth hidden is right over there
you deceived both yoon hee and i
are you okay
she said she s going to continue to watch over you and see you again in your death just like you did to her
do you think that my yoon hee is watching right now
yes
the president of this place is pretty decent
to stick himself out there to take his employee s side like that
that s how normally president joo joong won behaves
i m tae yi ryung let go of me
let go of me
i m tae yi ryung
i was trying to defend myself because you grabbed me so suddenly
you did the same thing the last time
i guess you re always on guard
is this where you work kang woo
your name s kang woo
yes that s correct i m glad i ran into you
- with what happened the other day
- i m working so i have to get going
- someone you know
- did he just diss me
- what happened
- master came and took care of everything
- the president himself - yes
i m positive that ms tae is the master s secret girlfriend
- i m sure of what i saw - i guess you re right
but you don t think i grabbed her too hard earlier do you
i don t want to upset her
you told me that you weren t going to believe anything and just going to ignore me but i m really grateful for the help you gave me
there s no need for you to thank me
all i did was get my own revenge
it wasn t just his own wife but that man betrayed my kingdom as well
he went against his contract and signed a contract with giant as well
the bastard
all i did was get my revenge on him for his betrayal
was that why you watched over him at the hospital because of your own suspicions
all i did was see something i shouldn t have because i went down the wrong path
what is this
i m back at the hospital
let s just go home now okay
i went and retrieved it because i went down the wrong path and saw what he did
sometimes people find the most unexpected things along their path there are times when they find themselves in an unexpected place during their travels
they think of it as unexpected luck or even perhaps a sign of misfortune
but they re not all just coincidences
you re telling me that it wasn t a coincidence that i got lost
it was a right turn
- right turn
- what is this
another right turn
then that place earlier wasn t it
stop right there
don t tell me any more useless things
president joo
i ve been giving it some thought
and i think i ve figured out a way to make myself very special to you
you say you re going to make yourself special to me
why
are you going to tell me the winning lottery numbers
cha hee joo
she s a very special person to you isn t she
i can see cha hee joo
that s right
you told me that hee joo is around me
so if you continue to stay around me then i guess you may get to see her again yes
if i can see cha hee joo again then i ll become special to you right
if i see her again i ll make sure to tell her
thank you
see
hee joo again
is there anything that you realized after this incident
what about me
even if the first thing you noticed about me was my money it doesn t really matter to me honey
all you need to do is make sure that you always keep your eyes on me
even though beauty fades over time and perky breasts will come to sag but my money will never dry up
so just remain loyal and faithful as you were to me in the beginning and don t look at anyone else
that s enough to satisfy me
i ll never change the love i have for you i see only you
okay
if i see that you re turning away from me even in the least i won t show you any mercy i will just get rid of you
that will never happen
never
hello
here why don t you drink this
our security team is going out to dinner tonight why don t you come join us

then you re coming okay
i don t mean anything else by it but i just want us to be friends i m serious
come on let s go
let s go
cheers
the atmosphere seems so much livelier with you here
what do you think of me gong shil what do you think of my style
are you trying to flirt with her
settings like this depends heavily on the compatibility between the men and women here
how about i take this opportunity to make you a frequent fliers card
if you come to three outings you get a free meal
if you come five times you get a free night of drinking on us
and if you come ten times blind date
how about a blind date
since ms tae gong shil can t drink how about a soda for you instead
here why don t you have a soda
non-alcoholic
- everyone grab a drink and cheers
- cheers
hey gong shil you look tired why don t you go relax over there
come on get up can you scoot over a little
here lean back and relax
i wonder if i m just tired
why does my head hurt so badly
are you okay
yes
i m having a great time
it s been a really long time since i ve been out with other people like this
are you not feeling well
- could it be that you re drunk
- i didn t have anything to drink
i m too scared to drink
because i become a whole different person when i get drunk
most other people gets that way when they re drunk
but i really do become a whole different person
cha hee joo
what you said about you liking me because i come from a rich family did you mean it
are you hesitating right now
that s pretty offensive
i just pretended to think about it so that you don t feel offended
if i admit it right away then it would only hurt you
joo joong won are you angry
i know that you ll stop being mad at me if i call out your name three times
joo joong one
joo joong two
joo joong three
it s not the least bit funny
even though you may not find it funny you re no longer mad at me right
bitch
it s that woman
i told him that i d get him to meet her again
that woman i reported to you about the last time does seem to have a special relationship with president joo
i will continue to watch her and see if she has anything to do with cha hee joo and what else she may know
tae gong shil
why are you here
how did you find out where i live
you hitched a ride in my car and came into my kingdom and now you dare to ring the doorbell to my house
didn t i warn you
did i not tell you to stop
joong won
joong won
you ve completely lost your mind
- you re mad at me aren t you
- yes i am i am mad at you
you re fired
don t ever show yourself in front of me again
get lost
will you stop being mad at me if i call out your name three times
joo joong one
joo joong two
joo joong three
that s not the least bit funny you
what are you
it s me
the bitch you hate
thank you
sorry i have to keep holding on to feel calm
let s go
- is this far enough
- yes
is this far enough
i don t think a ghost followed me
there aren t any
then why are you still holding on
my hand just keeps going towards your body
i m not an object that you can touch however you please
of course you re a very expensive man
i thought you wouldn t let me touch you because you were mad
thank you so much for helping me
i m valued at a very high cost
so be careful
that s right i m just someone valuable who sees ghosts
you re valued high for now but if you go overboard your value goes down
then there will be serious consequences
yes i m sorry
i was just trying to make you feel comfortable
don t bother
all i need is your sixth sense to get in touch with hee joo
i understand
i went overboard
i ll just focus on using my sixth sense nothing else
you ll start work tomorrow i ve found you a position
really
i ve always gotten fired because of the ghosts
i never thought i d find work again
thank you president joo
i ll work really hard to look out for ghosts from now on
i ll be here to protect you so do all that you can
yes i ll do well
but the salary will you really deduct from my pay if i touch you
holding hands is 100 000 won hugging is 1 000 000 won
i took it all out from your salary
wait i think that s too much
100 000 won
i won t touch you so carelessly
i m warning you to be careful
if you keep touching me you ll never see your salary
you should only touch me when absolutely necessary calculate well
i understand
so expensive
doesn t matter if you re uncomfortable
the truth is you need me
no matter how expensive my body can protect you
but if you put it that way you need me too
i m the only one who can connect you with cha hee joo
that s right
i do need you
that s right
you feel like you d die without me right
without you i d feel inconvenienced
- then hear me out
- get lost
president you were joking about the salary right
if i were kidding you would be laughing
100 000 won
not even worth a bottle of champagne
1 000 000 won
i hugged her for not even the price of a refrigerator
i was too cheap
was president joo here
he was so cool before
hey come to your senses
he didn t hug you because he liked you
he was making the ghosts go away
if you keep thinking like this it ll get dangerous
well i guess it s possible for two people to feel nervous around each other
you see ghosts but that doesn t mean you are one
okay
today i ll hug you a lot
1 000 000 won 2 000 000 won i love you
hey ghost go away
like it

this was a room for the vip members but there isn t any use for it anymore
so now we use it as storage
what will be my responsibilities
officially your title is advisor for special customer services but in reality you ll be cleaning up the storage room
ms tae seems disappointed since it wasn t what she expected
really
but it suits her just fine
advisor for special customer services
how can i advise any customers here
why is my first customer a ghost
i said i d get you coffee
do you know that woman
she s chinese and she s renowned for her matchmaking skills
she only arranges marriages for the wealthy dead

she s a ghost matchmaker they call her madam go
wealthy families sure do strange things

i spoke with the president of giant mall yesterday
i m guessing you weren t just exchanging greetings
we also exchanged information
the president of giant mall has a lot of business leverage
he s thinking of partnering with mrs wang for the shanghai distribution
mrs wang of the shanghai distribution
i heard she gave up on business after her grandson died
the president of giant mall is making an empty partnership
is he trying to build a lie
but still it would be worth looking into
mrs wang could be kingdom s vip member
oh about the center for special customer services that you set up
someone had paid her a visit already
just letting you know not bad right
your aunt stopped by to ask me for a favor
work
she said to go visit chairman wang
chairman wang i heard her grandson died not long ago
what if you see him there
do you think so
then i don t think i can go
no if you see him there go meet him
what
ask him about his grandmother s business plans
ask him if she has any plans to join giant
but i m scared
is president wang an important person
very important
ask her no matter what
since she s important to you i ll go
but i won t be able to sleep if i see something scary
you have me to protect you
do well
if you re scared i ll hold you
madam this is the lady
can you please change into these clothes
you want me to wear this
it s a favor
i m not mentioning that girl because it s better than hanging onto hee joo
she seems a bit lacking but she seems pretty normal
she s definitely not normal
she s doing work i ve asked her to do so please don t give her extra assignments
i didn t give her extra work
madam go asked for her particularly which is why i sent her
madam go
she s the woman who arranges spirit marriages for those who ve passed
seeing that she s taking her to mrs wang the rumors must be true
what rumor
i hear she s on the lookout for a wife to pair up with her dead grandson
this is amusing ghost rumors
but why would she insist on taking bang shil with her
president joo
i was a bit scared but now that you ve called i feel better
are you okay
what did you see there
oh her dead grandson
i think he s inside this house
i saw his portrait and he was very young and handsome
his grandmother is sad he spent all his time in the house sick

i ll just say it verbatim
grandma are you senile

and tell that lady to get lost she makes me want to puke
it s my ji woo
we have to take measures of precaution before joong won falls for bang shil
i m thinking of slowly pairing him up with a better woman
who
there s someone
explode like the fire from the propane
raise it
raise it up
as if you re the fireworks
passionately like it s consuming your body
raise your dress up
- raise it up
- way up
stretch it up
- then wither down - i m not doing this
wait a minute
let yi ryung drink some water
- how much left
- just one more scene
what
my arm is about to fall off
i m only going to hold the lid
miss yi ryung
the original concept was a wedding since my wedding was called off we had to changed it
you have a lot of issues now that you re wedding is canceled
if only your friend had not interfere with your marriage
my friend
didn t i tell you
i meant to tell you
the lady who got your wedding called off was your high school friend
she works at kingdom now
is it tae gong shil by any chance
so it was tae gong shil
a business deal fell through then someone in the family got sick
all the misfortune was blamed on ji woo
the business didn t do well because of the global economic crisis
everyone has a sick person in the family
how did it become all about ghosts
because of that
it s because of that
it s been 100 days since ji woo passed but the flowers are still fresh
as time passed everyone began to fear this fact
he s waiting for someone he likes
that never even crossed my mind
he was sick since he was a child
he had no friends because he was always in the hospital and this house
he also had a temper so no one got close to him
this is too hot
he was always a sensitive child
that child had this girl that he liked
i want to meet her for once as well
you will be able to meet her
right
i don t know i only know this kind of person
my employee will visit here back and forth and find out about it by talking a lot with your grandson
didn t you say she s an important employee so you have to take her with you
not at all
the only thing important to me is you ma am
anyways i will say it again i did not open the door
how much are you looking into the investment in china
i will need definite details from kingdom then i will consider it
our team will
miss
i think my employee saw something
excuse me who is the person that came here just now
the kid who came to deliver milk
was the milk delivery kid close with the grandson here
i didn t know who he was
oh the boy who delivered last time spoke a lot with the young master and they also played games together
did you find out who it is
i think so
who is the woman that this family s grandson waited for day and night
it s not a girl it s a guy
i think he s waiting for the milkman
a guy
miss
- did you figure something out
- yes well
no ma am she says she still doesn t know
we will come back tomorrow
let s go
president joo
how can you just leave
she s waiting shouldn t we let her meet him
are you telling me to drop a bomb on that grandma s face who s expecting to see her grandson s beautiful first love
no i m not trying to find the ghost s first love
the important thing is to make that grandma feel happy
so what are you going to do
the first love with the eyes of a pretty nurse in the hospital or with a teacher who taught piano let s split the fee with that in half with the ghost
but that s a lie
you said you didn t like lying yourself
when i made up the story about hee joo didn t you say that you didn t like lying
that kid is so pitiful
he has no one and he s waiting for the person that he liked
i want to let him meet her
but i ll do what you say
either just leave like this or go inside and tell her make a decision
go
find the milkman
instead let s not make it sound like it s his first love let s just say it s a friend
tae gong shil come fast
i will crush you
- are you the stalker
- what is this
tae yi ryung you again
get off you jerk
i m acting like this only because i shot my commercial today or else you ll be sued
there s no scratch
it s going to swell up
then why did you come to vent out on your friend about your canceled wedding
i didn t come to vent out but to take revenge
but looking at it it doesn t seem to be a victim s revenge
what are you going to do
i m going to tell her to watch out i m going to steal the guy
the guy
president joo
i m going to flirt with him and declare war to make her cry her eyes out
you don t think i ll be able to do it
i m tae yi ryung
so you re going to war but a secret weapon is important for battle
should i do that
you re going to help me
but there s a condition
find out the reason why president joo is interested in tae gong shil
why are you curious about that
do you perhaps like tae gong shil
well let s say i do
wait i think it s turning blue
hey why are you talking down to me
i could just tell you look younger than me
you sure do look older than me want me to treat you like an old person
fine talk in that familiar form
now that we re on the same side want to go for a drink to commemorate
drink by yourself
it s that guy from before
excuse me i d like to ask you something
you deliver milk in the neighborhood up there right
do you happen to know the person who delivered there before
the person s over there
it looks like him
he looks sturdy
excuse me
yes
you know ji woo right
ji woo
who s the person that used to deliver milk to that house
i did i m the one who used to bring deliveries to ji woo s house
he said it was a guy
there was a lot of misunderstandings like that before i grew my hair out
she may look like a girl but she s totally a guy
she s the one right
so you re the one that ji woo is waiting for
hey delivery
shouldn t you deliver it properly
the milk is all squashed
even though it s squashed it still tastes the same
even though it tastes the same i don t like it looking ugly just like you
i don t like being unlucky either just like you
what
what are you doing
delivery you re really a girl after all
an ugly girl
it s fortunate
that she s a girl how fortunate
i am aware of what happened to ji woo
i don t want to really talk about it please leave
there s something we really wanted to show you
it ll be great if you can go and take a look
it s a very pretty flower
a green rose
there are many kinds of roses
and many colors too then are there green roses as well
i like the color green
we do have green roses
awesome they must be pretty
they re not pretty at all
they look like cabbages just like you
hey if i grow out my hair and doll up i m fine too
why do you keep saying i m ugly
you look ugly
i can t even tell if you re a guy or a girl
i think being weak is girly
as i expected it was not good with a tomboy like you
hey
don t cry
if you cry you ll get uglier
i don t cry over a guy like you who s weak and grows flowers
i really don t like guys like you
ji woo
ji woo
they re very pretty
you lied saying they were ugly
i wanted to show you too so i grew out my hair
but you died like a fool
farewell
farewell my baby
farewell
the meaning of a green rose is a noble love that exists only in heaven
it s fortunate that ji woo that girl and the grandma found out about the truth right
we unveiled a very big secret today
you did your part too so i ll drive you home today
oh no
i don t want you to go all the way to the front of the study room
if i ride in your car it may be awkward if i bump into a certain person
oh you mean kang woo
- you guys live together right - yes
kang woo has a lot of interest in me he s really curious about what i do next to you
it s a bit awkward to give him an answer
it seems like you re hiding the fact that you have unique radars from kang woo
that s right
he keeps asking me what i m afraid of
i told him that it was a stalker
so he said he ll be my bodyguard
are you perhaps bragging right now
it s all thanks to you president joo
going to work and meeting people
stop the car
- i could go a little further
- no i don t want to go any further
i shouldn t have been too accommodating to you
get lost here
okay
well then
what the heck
you said it was free so i didn t want to just leave
then goodbye
let s go
how come i don t feel afraid after touching his hand
why is that
they don t look like ghosts but why are they following me
- miss come with us
- what are you doing
who are you
let s go
let go let go
kang woo are you okay
are those people the ones following you around
they re people but why did they follow me
that s enough
i came to see you again but it looks like i won t be able to
you shine too brightly
that s why the creatures of the darkness follow you
i shine brightly
they may complain and make a request you must be alert
amongst them there are some who are looking for a chance
the chance to come back by using you
darkness will swallow the light [ chinese phrase ]
darkness will swallow the light and death eventually swallows life
be careful and don t get swallowed
mom said she was coming now
seung joon didn t you hear what i said
seung joon
seung joon
seung joon
seung joon where are you
seung joon
seung joon
you have to tell me where you re going
it s a doll
you can t
we don t know if someone left it there
if it s still there later on then that means it s been thrown out so let s take it then
let s go
how did you meet that swindler
while working
you re not explaining in detail once again
anyway it was worth waiting over there
do you really like me
you like me so that s why you want to know more about me
the reason why i can t say everything about myself is because i really like it when someone likes me
they might run away if they find out
you re thinking what kind of big secret does this woman hold that she s trying to scare me away right
is she perhaps a spy
a criminal
or is originally a man
various things come to mind right
but you re going to be even more surprised than whatever it is that you re thinking of
i warned you don t come any closer
thank you so much for today
don t say thank you
it just makes me feel bad
you re not the only one who has a secret
there could be something i m not saying as well
after listening to your warning i am kind of scared that i might disappoint you as well
sleep tight
he says he likes me so much should i just tell him
kang woo i see ghosts
how can i say this
chairman wang will be holding hands with my kingdom
it s an innate choice
she said she ll hold my hand as well she said to go to china with her
so - are you going
- i can t
you re here
it s too bad but i declined
so is that why you don t have any strength
do you really regret declining chairman wang s offer
it s not that it s something else that i got rejected
that was very regretful
and what is that
the person who likes me
thank you
thanks
hold onto your mom s hand well
thank you
come this way please
i can t say that i can see ghosts
he says that he likes me so i can t say it even more
if it can t be then i just want to pretend to be an a normal person
but i m so depressed why do i have to see ghosts
tae gong shil
you look more like a normal person than the first time i met you
probably think it s because you re arrogant
i m so funny right
it s because i have some room to breathe so i have a lot of time to think about things i got greedy too
humans want more if they can live
that can happen
thank you president joo
you have become an air defense for me and a counseling room as well
you brought chairman wang and broke off the deal with giant mall
so i ll give you a discount
thank you
but i feel so depressed today i really don t want to see ghosts today
can you tag along when i go home
humans bite into it when they think it s the right time
that cannot happen
okay
- what s the occasion - there wasn t enough
but you know tae gong shil who worked with us
the reason why she went to customer service was because she received president joo s special attention
- president joo
- they re that close
there are a lot of evidence already and also a number of people who saw them
lee han joo s mouth is quite loud so the rumors are spreading faster than expected
president joo should probably hear it by now
we have to connect like
- didn t gong shil have a lover
- she did a lover
oh you know she comes to work and leave with that employee who works on the security team
then it s a love triangle
who is it
the security team
hey
there s guy who lives together with tae gong shil on our security team
who is the person she grabbed and dragged to go home together
not only that he s also her personal bodyguard
really
tae gong shil is trash
but with her dark circles hanging how can she seduce men
right
i ve been watching from afar but looking at it closely it seems they ve grown very close together
possessing the mind is the way to seduce them
in that loreley hill myth men jumped in to die
anyways who is that guy
it s me
pardon
the one preparing to dive on the hill is me
it s not easy jumping in
i would need to brave
you would need enforcements
what is trash
sorry
only deliveries are coming in instead of the customers
this is a storage house
tae gong shil
- mr kim
- yes
when we leave later we re taking tae gong shil with us
yes sir
i want to know you
i will bring up the courage so you should cheer up i will bring up the courage
so you should cheer up
president joo
the person who likes me said he will bring up his courage for me
he told me to cheer up
and so you re going to cheer up and go
yes
i want to try to go
i want to go
subtitles by dramafever
when i touch you like this
it doesn t affect you does it
right
you do you really think that i m just a deflective shield made out of marble
there s no way that can be the truth
i m not totally unaffected by it
then do you you know something happens to you too
i ve always felt a little something
you just with me you just touch me much too freely
i haven t said anything before because i didn t want to sound weird since you seem to think nothing of it but now that you re finally starting to react like a normal person i m going to ask a favor of you
when you use me as your shield i want it to be a casual touch so that people will think that we re good friends
i don t like it when others look at us as if we have something going on
this is to be used in friendly terms
and this stuff it makes people question do you understand
yes i understand
to be honest i didn t give much thought to whether you liked it or not all this time i pushed myself on you just so that i can survive
i think that i will be more careful from now on
careful i have to be more careful
yes be more careful
be more cautious of stuff like this too
from now i ll listen to all your ghost stories so don t go trying to face things alone and end up like this anymore
worrying about things like this is what friends do
any closer and it makes people wonder what s going on
- do you understand - yes
let s go i ll take you home
no it s okay i ll just go home on my own
you were locked up in jail
you even got yourself hurt today that much concern is allowed
get in the car and i ll take you home
i have to be cautious
i just picked up something strange on my radar now
that s why you should grab onto me
use me
no it s okay
are you being cautious because you don t want kang-candy to see me bringing you home
no i m just being cautious
i have nothing to be cautious of
if we run into kang-candy on our way he s not going to wonder because i m going to tell him that we re just close friends
so don t worry about it and come
do you know what a good thing it is for you to be good friends with the boss
even kang-candy won t be able to do anything about it
it has been confirmed that president joo got himself involved in tae gong shil s issue that s why he was taken to jail earlier today
i m positive that tae gong shil has something to do with the late cha hee joo
i didn t pick up on that sooner because i let my personal feelings get in the way
i m sorry for the slip-up
cha hee joo was an orphan
if that woman also lost her parents early then could it be possible that they met in an orphanage when they were young
i ll look into it and one more thing
see if that woman tae gong shil has ever spent any time in europe
yes sir
kang woo i sensed that you may have developed an interest or feelings for that woman
are you okay
i will be
don t try to be too strong and tell me if it gets too tough
when you re not being honest with your heart the pain you feel will give you your answer
do you think this is going to pain you
i will put an end to my feelings for her
president joo
thank you for everything today
since you stayed in a jail today make sure to eat some tofu when you get home
i don t eat stuff like that
okay i ll be going then
goodbye tae gong shil didn t you say that you picked up something strange on your radar earlier
- did something follow you here
- ah that wasn t anything scary it s just something that needs to be scolded
so i m going to talk to it and set it straight
drive home safely
let s go
he s not the candy and you re just his radar
get yourself together
ever since meeting tae gong shil i m popping these bitter calming pills like they re regular vitamins
ugh so bitter
i need water
since you stayed in a jail today make sure to eat some tofu when you get home
does this look like tofu
when i touch you like this it doesn t affect you does it
that woman only holds my hand when she sleeps she sure does worry a lot about needless stuff
ugh so salty
since i m not picking up any scary ghosts with my radar lately am i resorting to other absurdities now
touching him on the face like you did earlier is a form of sexual harassment
it s no different than touching someone s butt in the subway
grandmother from the supermarket why are you here again
how am i supposed to get any sleep when you re standing there staring at me like that
since you re already here can you just scare me once so that i can come back to my senses
enough enough that s enough
no you can stop it now
stop just stop it
president joo
i heard that you were dragged off to jail because you got yourself in something that doesn t even make you any money
i was really shocked when i heard that
i was really shocked myself
i don t have much to say since i heard you did a good deed but ever since bang shil came into the picture you re doing things that you never used to do
even your father has somehow heard about it he asked me who she was
that s an even more shocking bit of news
do you keep him updated with reports on me
no not me we only talked about golf the last time we spoke
i m sure he was asking others about you he must ve heard of it from someone else
it s a given that a father should be interested in his son s affairs
receiving such obvious interest for the first time in 34 years is throwing me into a shock i don t even know how to handle it
i m sure it s because your father s getting older now so he s starting to get more interested in what s going on in his son s life
don t you think so honey
yes of course
he s at an age where he wants to become a grandfather now
president joo i hope that you really succeed this time
i m not sure
i don t know if meaningless physical relationship would produce a grandchild for my father
grandmother
i ve returned to my senses so can you step out of the trash can
okay no don t please don t roll your eyes back into your head like that
please get out of there
kang woo
are you heading out to exercise this late at night
yes i m going out for a run
i know that we were supposed to come home from work together tonight i m sorry for having left without you
something suddenly came up that i had to tend to
tae gong shil
i m going to tell you this because i think it would be best to set things straight
when i told you about me liking you that was just a misunderstanding
excuse me
i said it as a joke to the other guys but you took it to be real i felt really bad about it so i didn t tell you the truth
and when you told me that you were grateful that i liked you i tried to see if i could make myself like you but i don t think that i can do that
i m sorry
ah i see
i knew something wasn t right about it
this is embarrassing
then you should ve told me the truth from the beginning
when you gave me that candy and those musical tickets it threw me into a tizzy of my own i just ended up making a fool of myself
even though you accepted that candy and those musical tickets i know that you don t really like me isn t that right
someone i respect once told me that when i m not being honest with my heart the pain i feel will give me my answer
and it seems to me that you re not in any pain over me
then is it okay for me to feel less sorry
you have to go get the ball
hey what s wrong
someone we need some help over here
over here
wake up
please wake up
this is the third pool accident at kingdom enterprises
she said that there was something under water that pulled on her leg but there was nothing in the water
it s not like there s a water ghost just what could it be
are you positive that someone else just didn t play a prank on her
i saw the video footage of the incident it wasn t a prank played by another person
it s still the middle of the summer and a weird rumor like this is floating around this could mean that we may lose all our customers to giant mall
we can t allow for that to happen
i should put my radar to work in the swimming pool
giant mall is taller than my building
chief secretary kim
hi my ten billion won radar
i need you to turn on your radar
you were you up getting bothered all night
your dark circles are about to dig their way into the ground
the grandmother from the supermarket came to visit me last night so i didn t sleep a wink
president joo
do i look sick
you always look sick
but especially today you look like a zombie
it s not like you ve ever seen a zombie in real life
you ve never said anything about a zombie but you have told me that you ve seen a water ghost before haven t you
yes
once i went down to han river with my sister to eat some rotisserie chicken i almost drowned when i got lured into the water by a water ghost
water ghost
i never want to see the water ghost again
never again
i really hate the water ghost i really hate it
it s so scary
grab on
no one s ever caught a water ghost before
water ghost
she s really terrified by it
i almost feel bad about sending her in there to catch the ghost
president joo wanted you to use that to go there on your next day off
gift certificate for kingdom hotel
- isn t this a really nice place
- he put several of them in there for you he wants you to take some friends and have a good time
he was telling me earlier that i looked like a zombie
he s sending me to a place like this so i can go and get some rest
yes he is
i m so happy
i gave it to her
she was very excited and told me that she d go tomorrow
okay
i ll get her to go there first and tell her to look once she s already there
okay
kingdom s hotel is super fancy
i can t believe it
i have a few more certificates if you want to take some more friends you can take them with you
in that case should we ask 404 to come with us
okay let s just pack our bags
make sure to pack a lot of pretty clothes because we ll drive up in my car
gong ri i ll take lots of pretty pictures of you okay
gong shil i m so happy right now this is so great
hey isn t there a swimming pool at the kingdom hotel
let s pack up our bathing suits too okay this is so great
doesn t it creep you out knowing that there could be something in the swimming pool
there s nothing in there it s not like we have a loch ness monster
what did you call me out for
i m not someone who can be called out so easily for a meeting
thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to come meet me
what is the favor that you have to ask of me
i need you to find something about tae gong shil that s not in the records
you can find out who her close friends were and find out if they ve met her parents and what kind of relationship they had right
why do you want to know about her family
do you want to marry her
if i wanted to marry her i wouldn t check up on her like this
- i ll just ask to meet her family
then is this work related
surveillance
if that s the case then i will help you
why don t we talk about this some more over a meal
do i have to have dinner with you for you to help me
no it s not like that
i was just offering to let you tag along since it s almost time for dinner
if that s the case you don t have to include me
find out what you can and call me
hey
i already made the dinner reservation
why is he being so picky for someone so average
- chief secretary kim - yes do you by any chance give my father reports on me
i haven t spoke to him since he went back overseas after his trip home last year
why do you ask
a father who never once showed interests in the women i might have consider marrying is all of a sudden showing interest in tae gong shil
- and i find that very strange - i m sure it s just a fatherly interest
that s just absolutely absurd
what about tae gong shil is she on her way to the hotel
gong ri this place is amazing
hurry up and get down here okay
i ll get on the road as soon as i m off work
enjoy yourself until then okay
where are you going
you don t need to know
i m a career woman myself
why do i have to go around doing background checks on tae gong shil
look at what i ve got
come hang out with us and bring kang woo okay
you want us to tag along to where the tae sisters are going to play
i want to hook gong shil up with kang woo
i ll owe you one if it turns out well
should i report this to the vice president or just go play
let s just go play
yes i should just go play
i don t know if it s because this place is so big but for some reason i don t feel scared here
there s a fireworks show tonight
they can t have a firework show in the middle of the day and i m too scared to go out at night
that s nothing but an impossible dream for me
president joo
where are you
i m at the hotel lobby
this place is really nice
of course it is
the place belongs to me the painting that you re standing next to right now is a very expensive painting
yes it does look expensive
but how did you know where i was standing
because i m standing right behind you
president joo
- what are you doing here
- i followed you here
did you come here alone
what about dinner my sister isn t here yet
is that right
let s have dinner first
he followed me here
why
- are you finished with the preparations
- yes i will forbid anyone from entering the pool area after dinner hours
i guess we can have dinner first before we head over there
- where are we going - i ll tell you after dinner
president joo must be planning a surprise event for that woman tonight
how nice it must be for her
i bet he rented out the whole swimming pool so they could watch the fireworks alone
is there anything specific that you d like to eat
tell me i ll buy you whatever you d like
are you trying to buy me something good because i look weak and frail to you
yeah
then i want you to buy me everything
okay let s go
it s been 15 years since hee joo s death
i really appreciate you not forgetting that this is where she grew up and showing us such generosity
i can t believe it s already been 15 years since miss cha hee joo died
i felt doing this is like repaying her for her death i ve considered severing off ties with this place
but now i feel like i did the right thing by continuing to come here for joong won s sake
this was where master joo first met cha hee joo isn t it
yes it was
team leader kang woo
what is he doing here
chief secretary kim
- what are you doing standing there
- yes i m coming
tae gong ri and tae gong shil our orphanage never had a pair of sisters by those names before
why are you coming along when you can t get kang woo to come
team leader kang woo had to work and i never back out on my plans
then why don t you pay for the gas
maybe next time
it s kim dong soo
someone you know
you two have the same thing
who is he an asshole who disappeared after scheming me out of my money
i think i just got a whiplash
are you following him
you can t do that
- we have somewhere else to be
- shut up and hold tightly onto your seat
it s carbonated water since you can t drink alcohol you can just drink this instead
thank you
getting some rest at a nice place like this is helping your dark circles diminish
- it s nice to see
but don t you have any other clothing
my sister is bringing my luggage she just called to tell me that she s going to be a little late
excuse me a moment
she needs something to change into once she s out of the water
do i have to get that for her too
hey i heard that president joo joong won closed off the pool tonight to host a special event during the fireworks
wow i don t know who the woman is but it must be so nice for her
- to be jealous is to lose
- i wish i can just go on a date
a surprise event
could it be possible that he s planning something for me
are you heading back to your room
let s meet at the lobby again in two hours
but we ve already had dinner
is there going to be something else
there s something very important that we still have left to do
i don t want you to get too angry even if you re really caught off guard
okay
president joo rented out the swimming pool and i m the one he s going to be meeting in two hours
then did he rent out the swimming pool for me
make sure that no one else can come in once i m in there
yes sir and send all the prepared items to the guest room that i mentioned earlier
coming
- what is this
- it s from president joo joong won
it s so pretty
so pretty
then the important thing that president joo mentioned
president joo
did you prepare all this for me
that s right
there s more
look
you may go in
president joo is waiting for you inside
did he really rent out the swimming pool so that no one else can come in
yes that s correct he s instructed me not to let anyone else other than the two of you in there
i m here because there s a problem with the hotel swimming pool
i m not here to play
yes
i ll figure out what s in the water and will be back once i take care of it
yes
it shouldn t take long
hi my ten billion won radar we need to turn on your radar
you told me that you ve seen a water ghost before right
yes
tae gong shil
tae gong shil where are you going
give me a minute
that was a close call
i almost totally humiliated myself
good thing i didn t fall for that act
but why why do i feel so upset
when your heart isn t being honest your pain gives you the answer
can i get you anything else
like what
flowers champagne or whatever else you need just say the word and i ll get it for you
forget it
i think she s misunderstood about something
- she must ve been kicked out of there
- i guess it wasn t a romantic event for her
you changed your clothes
yes i figured this would be more comfortable
you looked pretty in the dress
let s go
it s okay there s nothing scary around here
there may not be ghosts here but there are people s watchful eyes
those people are wondering about what s going on between us and you know we can t have that
i don t care whatsoever what those people think
all i see is how what those people are saying is getting to you
tae gong shil
you re upset aren t you
yes
you really did look like a candy girl the way you ran out of there all dressed up
yes you re right
think about it if you invite a girl to a place like this and buy her fancy dinner and clothes then any girl would think you want her to your candy girl
you should ve just told me to do my job as a radar
- why go through all that trouble
- you told me that you were scared
i am your shield after all
i felt bad for forcing you in there when you told me how much you hated it
was that what you were doing
if that s the case i do feel a little better
let s go catch the water ghost
let s go
i m okay now president joo
let go of my hand if you think you can do it
this doesn t bother me at all
i think they re all expecting a heartbroken girl
but i don t want to give them what they want let s go
you re quick
i asked all the girls whom gong shil is closest to
they told me that gong shil and her sister had really caring and loving parents
i recorded the phone conversations
- want me to play it for you
- no send me the audio files
anyways thanks for your help
hey
this makes me feel like a total spy
i ve always wanted to be in a movie like that
aren t you a singer
i ve been in a movie too
have you never googled me
you can find me easily on the internet
how long are you going to keep following me around
salary man you don t even have a car do you
i ll give you a ride in my car
come on i ll give you a ride
i m going to take the subway
that brat
taeyang we ve been sitting here for a while now
have you seen anything
no i don t see anything
i wonder if it s in the water
i think i m just going to look for the ghost in the water
just wait a little bit longer
it could show itself once it gets a little later in the night
just like how the anticipation of getting a shot is the scariest part it s the same thing with the ghosts they re scarier when something is about to happen rather than actually seeing it
and i want to get this over with before the fireworks starts
i m just going to go in and look for it
will you be alright
water ghosts are really scary
once they get a hold of you they drag you down and never let go
if i don t resurface you ll pull me out of the water right
forget it don t do it
go back to the room and get some rest while you watch the fireworks
what about the water ghost
we should just take care of it while the swimming pool is empty
i ll just drain the water out of the pool and wait it out instead
let s just forget it and go
you almost fell in the water
it s right there there s a lady over there
i m so scared
that must be his house
i ve got you now kim dong soo
i m going to get all my money back and tear you to pieces
he s married
but i thought you were going to tear him to pieces
honey have you seen tae yi ryung s latest video
ugh i don t like her
she can t even sing but she flaunts herself around as a singer
she was pretty when she was younger but now that she s older you can tell how many plastic surgeries she s had
i know you totally can
she s a has-been
she s totally getting shoved aside by all the younger and prettier girls like iu
she s over the hill now
let s get off at the next station
hello my name is tae yi ryung
- it s tae yi ryung
i m still pretty successful
iu
thank you
please show your support for tae yi ryung
why
i was having fun
you re really a bad singer
you think but i still looked pretty right
- you re a total lunatic
- yeah that s why i ve decided
let s date
no i don t want to
how can you cut me off right away
you have dog-like manners
hey
- wow it s tae yi ryung
- wow it really is her
the water ghost is a lady
yes
she s right over there
over there
- yes - what is she doing over there
she s putting her makeup on
her makeup
who is a ghost going to impress by putting her makeup on
something feels very strange
the lady is leaving
if she s a water ghost then shouldn t she just stay in the water
i don t think she s a water ghost
what
what is it
she went that way
what took you so long
that lady took a shower took a steam bath in the sauna and she even knocked on the bathroom stall before going in
- are other ghosts that polite
- i don t think that she knows she s dead
where is she right now
she s heading up the stairs right now
the lady is seated in that chair over there and is having a meal right now
so she s not staying just in the swimming pool
she s wiping off her mouth right now
i think she s getting ready to leave
- where is she going now
she s reading a magazine
what is this is she taking a tour of the hotel right now
she just went into that room
that s the most expensive room in this hotel
- excuse me
- yes are there any guests staying in that room right now
no that room is vacant right now
open the door
what is that lady doing in this expensive room
she s sitting over there by that window and elegantly sipping on a glass of wine while staring out at the skyline
she s acting like she s still alive
if she s acting like a living person instead of a ghost then why is she doing in the swimming pool
since she doesn t know that she s dead i think maybe she s just shoved people out of her way while swimming in the pool
go tell her that she s dead and tell her to check out of this hotel
- go on
- okay
ma am
i really am sorry to be the one to tell you this but you can t keep going around doing what you re doing
what did she say
did she get the point
she says she won a contest for a stay so she has the right to be here
she showed me the same voucher that i have
she s a contest winner for a weekend getaway here
he name is kang gil ja and she won a spa giveaway contest
- is it her
- yes it s her of all the guests we ve had here i remembered her the most
- hello are you ms kang gil ja - yes i am
please follow me
it s so nice in here
i wish i could live in a place like this every day
i remember how happy she was the whole time that she stayed at this hotel
if she was that loyal of a customer i understand why she still hasn t been able to forget about this place even in her death
what do you mean dead
- who s dead
- ms kang gil ja
we know that she passed away
no you must have misunderstood
she s still alive
- what do you mean she s still alive
- where is she i heard that she s at the hospital
is that possible
i ve never had this happen before so i m not sure either
she s perfectly fine so why isn t she waking up
what do you mean she s fine
she collapsed from exhaustion while getting your birthday dinner ready so how can you speak of her like that
why are you yelling
dad you re the one who got drunk that night and just passed out
you have no room to talk
you were always being a brat to your mom
but why isn t she waking up
ma am you can t continue to be like this
you have to go back to your body or you really could lose your life
i don t think she wants to go back
what did you say her daughter s name was
joo yeon
she s responsive to the name
excuse me lee joo yeon s mom you can t stay here
your family is waiting for you
you have to go back to the living
would you like to go
you ve made the right decision
it no longer fazes me at all to see her acting like that
- okay okay
- okay
i guess she got the point
the lady is going to go back to her body
she says she wants to see tonight s fireworks before going back
i ll go down to the swimming pool and watch the fireworks with her
she already changed her clothes
i ll be back
tae gong shil
the ghost got herself all dressed up for the occasion you shouldn t let her show you off
since this is her last time should i dress for the occasion with her
she looks really excited
it s been forever since i ve seen fireworks
i bet it ll be really beautiful
ma am
ma am wait for me
i ll come with you
people are watching
instead of speaking to the lady pretend that you re speaking to me
shall we go
this was a wonderful dream
but i guess it s time for me to wake up now
mom
- honey
- gil ja are you okay
are you finally awake
mom can you see me
mom i m so glad that you re awake
i ll be a really good girl from now on
thank you so much for coming
thank you so much
is ms kang gil ja liking this
yes
she says she loves every bit of it
this feels like a midsummer night s dream
she said that being here was like a dream that made her forget everything else
it felt thrilling and made her happy but she said it was painful too
because she really loved what she saw here
the lady s gone
since when
just now
since i can t see i can just take your word for it right
yes
the fireworks is over
tonight i i shattered someone else s nice dream
tae yi ryung s surprise subway appearance
i had no idea that he would be married
hey
i got the schedule for your business trip to china
- how long will i be gone for
- for a week
a week is a pretty long time
should i tell her about it
ms tae already knows about your trip
she knows and she s fine with it
this is what ms tae told me
president joo is like a special gift voucher that i won at a contest
it s unbelievable luck on my part
but that s not a place where i can stay forever
if i m to be able to live well on my own i have to get used to being without him
i knew it
all that nonsense she spouted off the other night wasn t about her own feelings but kang gil ja s love for my hotel
i let it affect me for nothing
are you upset by it
no not at all
hearing that she doesn t need me makes me feel lighter and happier
when you re not being honest with your heart the pain you feel is your answer
ms tae also told me that
she told me that s how she found her answer
when you re not honest with your heart the pain you feel is your answer
i ve heard those words before from someone else
who would that be
cha hee joo
when you re not being honest with your heart the pain you feel is your answer
i have to be beaten back to my senses is that what you re telling me
that s right
since you like me much more than i like you it s a given that your heart should be in bigger pain than mine
you re saying that if i want to like you i should be in pain
yes i d like for you to be in an awful lot of pain joong won
where did you hear those words
did you by any chance hear them from hee joo
no i haven t seen hee joo
how did you know the words that hee joo used to say to me
i heard those words from kang woo
bring me team leader kang woo s resume and portfolio again
yes by the way president joo
when i went to drop off the donation at the orphanage where cha hee joo grew up i saw team leader kang woo there
team leader kang woo had a stellar resume and he came highly recommended so that s why i scouted him
is there a problem
who gave you the recommendation
- that s
- was it my father
you ve known about it
your father told me not to tell you about it i didn t think that you d like knowing that he had a hand in who you hired so i stepped in as the middle man i was just trying to considerate of you both
from now on don t split your consideration in half and whether you choose my side or go to his side just pick one side and stick to it
i heard that you were sent here by my father
i was instructed to investigate those that surrounds you in your life
why he said late cha hee joo s co-conspirator may try to approach you again
why
he believes that someone that cha hee joo knows was a co-conspirator of the kidnapping and may come around you again he believes that cha hee joo was a co-conspirator of the crime not the victim
is he right
did you really not see the kidnapper s face
i want you to give me your honest answer first
the ransom that they demanded did you really pay them
do you think that hee joo died because i didn t give them the money
if that s not the case then why are you nervous that i might ve seen the kidnapper s face
you believe whatever you want to believe
and you father you can believe whatever you want to believe as well
why is he so curious about that again after 15 years has passed tell him to come and explain his reasons to me
and one more thing since he told me to believe whatever i want to believe tell him that i believe that the lost necklace wouldn t be found in my father s possession
and there s one more message that i want you to relay to him i m working hard to find the necklace so i hope that he s not the one to find it
i wonder what kang woo s relationship to cha hee joo is
cha hee joo
what s wrong
what happened
cha hee joo was just here
she told me she told me why she s a bitch
i knew that you d find out one of these days since you can see her that she was one of the kidnappers
who else did she say it was
did she tell you who are her co-conspirators
she won t tell me
what
she told me that she needs to protect that person
okay
i want you to be in a lot of pain joong won
tae gong shil
don t go
stay here with me
i don t want her to see me like this
since you can see her stay with me and protect me
subtitles by dramafever
you will get strength
kang woo
kang woo
in order to come tell you my secret i got strength
say it i will listen to you with courage
i
i see ghosts
over here is a ghost
over there is a ghost
the ghosts pop out everywhere
that s why i ve been running away like a crazy lady
is it okay with you
even if you tell me that you got abducted by aliens i don t care
♫ i m all about ♫
kang woo
isn t it possible for dreams to come true
episode 6
since you compare it to a dream you must be acknowledging that the possibility of it coming true is slim
but it s not impossible right
a long time ago at a hospital i met this crazy man that claimed to have been abducted by aliens
but even such a man found a wife who understood him so they built a fortress in the mountain and lived together
are you as someone who sees ghosts looking down on a person who claims to see aliens
he was the one that called me crazy first
at first i listened to all of his stories about aliens
i even agreed to go with him to take pictures of a ufo
i thought we had gotten close so i told him that i m able to see ghosts but he just called me crazy
alright so you must have felt indignant
for me it s too bad
if you followed that man and got captured by aliens at that time there wouldn t be a reason for you to be here infront of me right now
anyway there are such things as ghosts so there could be aliens as well
but it could have been dangerous don t you think
no
this isn t it
with you something that was meant as a joke turns serious
i feel like i m turning into an idiot
why am i listening to this kind of story
do you think that person will listen to me too
like you mr ceo
will he listen to me
i don t want to lose this hard gained opportunity
i thought there were no opportunities like this before but it feels so good to have it
don t start with seeing start with believing
pardon
don t just start telling him you can see ghosts
ask him if he believes it
make him curious about it first
so there will be greater chances to make your dream come true
ah i will keep that in mind mr ceo
from now on have the crazy talks with manager kang after you ve broken ice about ghosts
so go and work it out with the sweet kang candy
get lost
yes
i see she s happy
tae yang who usually leaves after i tell her to get lost three times gets lost at the first this time
mr ceo
what now
if i tell you to go you should go
what is it
thanks for not laughing at my dreams and listening to me
i didn t put effort into hearing it
i just listened because i have ear holes
if you also have things you can t tell others tell me
i will have my ears wide open and listen
i don t have anything else to say to you i m going to work
get lost
yes
mr ceo
what
what
what
are you listening to music while you work
no
then what is it
i said i had nothing else to say
please get lost
yes
she always makes me tell her to get lost 3 times
if she gets stuck on the sticky kang candy she won t have a reason to bother me any more
how do i start the conversation
ghosts
no
souls or spirits
what s the easiest to do
that was just a prank
are you okay
that s why i said don t surprise gong shil
what to do
you said let s go visit her out of the blue and then you go and scare her
i was surprised too
i m really sorry
you came out so suddenly i didn t know you were a person
then if it s not person then would i be a ghost
it s not that
she has her guard up because of a harassing stalker
that s why you were scared like you saw a ghost
oh my my
ghost
what kind of a person can see those
why not
i ve seen one before
it s hot today
do you want me to tell you stories of the ghosts i ve seen
don t
why would you do that to someone who s scared already
no
it s okay
go ahead
what kinds of ghosts have you seen
hey
why
which one should i tell first
there are many
the elevator ghost the bathroom ghost the army ghost etc
yes vice president
just like lee han joo said
manager kang and gong shil live in the same place
and this place is really cheap
keep watching them
that cheap ceo joo said he s opened his body but he didn t open his wallet
if he hasn t opened his wallet then he couldn t have possibly opened his heart
it couldn t possibly be that he s opened his heart to tae yi ryeong right
the tallest building in shinsadong belongs to my grandfather
to your maternal grandfather you said your mom is the only child right
yes and to my mother i am the only child
that means that that building will soon be yours
i told them to clear the table after we eat chirashi but let s order the full course meal
longer
let s eat for a long time
auntie
the best of the all ghosts is the headless ghost that follows you like this
out of all the ghosts i ve heard of the best one by far is the kong-kong-kong ghost
there will be no ghost scarier than kong kong kong ghost
- i think the scariest is the statue at the school that sheds bloody tears at midnight
because of that we couldn t spend our night at school
we have a statue like that at my high school too
was there a mirror ghost at your school too
you know the grudged spirit of the student who was always second place becomes the mirror ghost
we also had that ghost in our piano classroom
the student who always got second place at competitions showed up every night and played the song
fur elise
but
kang woo you don t like stories like these
yes i don t find them fun
it s not that you don t find them fun isn t it because you are scared
look the lettuce is shaking
but i heard that if you talk about ghosts they come and listen
what
they are already here
there behind you
ah stop it now
i really hate these kinds of stories
how stupid
we are just doing it out of fun
you are really scared because you believe that they really exist
i do not believe that they exist
i hate people who try to scare others by convincing them that they exist
i really hate it
ghosts spirits people going around saying they saw those things i find them the most pitiful and i can t stand them
he detests it
don t ever tell him alright
that scared me
why do they keep telling ghost stories
making me scared
i m goint to go talk to uncle and come back
let s eat
were you taken aback by your aunt calling you out here without forewarning
not at all
when my aunt arranges dinner dates i come and eat when i have the time
but don t i make you uncomfortable
since i m gong shil s friend
not at all
i was hesitant because you two seemed very close
i feel better knowing that it doesn t bother you
you worried for no reason
if you say so i ll carefully tell you something
gong sil that girl is out of her mind
you don t know her from the past but that girl she was pretty normal back then
but seeing how she crashed and burned i can only assume that something dramatic happened to her
keeping someone so unlucky like her close by
tae yi ryeong is the purpose for you coming here was to place tae gong shil on this plate and fillet her
of course not
then let s continue our conversation about real estate
your story about your uncle s resort was very interesting
oh yes the land actually belongs to my father so i guess you could say it is a family business
where should we go next
i ll be there before the fish stew comes out
yes
ceo joo is spending quite a bit of time with tae yi ryeong
what was that
was it over there
what is that
it was a dog a dog
there s a big dog in kingdom
honey what should we do
a dog in a shopping mall
i alerted the security team so if there is anything they will find it
it s a dog a dog
i even heard the sound
we have to catch it before we open tomorrow
go to your assigned areas and search in teams of two
yes
really a dog came in here
i don t raise dogs
vice president got bit by a dog here
darn why did this happen while we were out eating barbecue
check if you re missing anything
yes
who did this
did a dog really come in here
are you sure you didn t lure it here
oh mr ceo
you take care of the poor ghosts did you bring a dog to raise it here
no
what is this smell
did you leave meat here
did the dog come here smelling meat
you really have the nose of a dog
i came from eating meat with kang woo
oh my candy
where could it be
did it eat it
ah it s here
i found it
ca -
it broke
what to do
this is a dog s collar
there must really be a dog
i was at dinner with ceo joo and i followed him here because i was curious
things must be going according to your plan
we had a deep conversation about your topic of interest tae gong shil
but i don t think tae gong shil means anything to ceo joo
when i brought her up he cut off talks of her
there must be a reason why he gave her a job to keep her close by
why are you so curious about their relationship
are you concerned about their relationship because you like tae gong shil
let s say that s it
i think things will go well for me
i ll let you know if i need your help
i guess you ll have to work overtime to catch that dog
do you get overtime pay
a few bucks
you know the car garage
take that elevator and go downstairs
what do you mean
you should escort me to my car
i need to find that dog to get paid
go now
dog like manners
it must be dangerous to have a dog who has bit a person running around right
if we don t find it tonight we cannot open tomorrow
the summer festival that i invested tons of money in will get cancelled
i organized it so that they can all gather and spend a lot of money
this cursed dog will ruin it all
it ate the chips and kimbap i left
the dog must be hungry
what are you going to do
mr ceo the name on the collar
pil seung must be the dog s name right
it must be
mr ceo let s catch that dog and have the summer festival
i ll make sure to find that dog
pilseung
let s win
pil seung
pil seung where are you
what is this
i thought you would come up with an impressive strategy
but you are just going to try to lure the dog with two sausages
dogs like things like this the best
that s enough
just go home
wait a minute mr ceo
mister
mister did you see a dog
alright
what did you just do
over there there s a male ghost who always sits there and goes through the trash
there s such a thing over there
that man looks really scary
his mouth are split wide like this and his eyes
wait what if the ghost hears you talking about him like that
i have you mr ceo
there s also a female ghost in the women s restroom who is always sitting on the toilet clogging it
should i go ask her
it seems like you have become intimate with many ghosts while working here
there are ghosts that tend to stay in one place and not leave
i was scared of them at first but i feel bad for them
and now that i ve seen them a few times they re like my coworkers
does that mean you guys get together occasionally and go out to eat
why are you making such scary jokes
when they get together it s scary
going out to eat with coworkers should be like tonight grilling meat while laughing and talking
although tonight s dinner got ruined once the topic of ghosts came up
tae gong shil
something smells fishy
you weren t able to come clean about your ghost-seeing ability with sweet candy kang right
kang woo says that ghosts are the things he hates most in this world
he says he hates people who say ghosts exist even more than he hates ghosts
what should i do
why are you asking me that
i hate them too
i hate them too but i m letting you stay close by because i find you useful
alright
i guess i ll be useful and help kang woo by looking for that dog
i ll go check out that restroom over there
stay here and wait
am i a mutt who waits for his owner
i m not going to wait
if the dog had a collar he should have an owner
is the owner here with the dog
a man dressed in black is escaping towards district a
the restroom ghost says she didn t see it
should i ask the storage room ghost
did you lose him
he went outside
that guy he s a bit strange
why
why
what
remember that part-time worker hyung cheol who worked at customer service
he went to the military right
hyeong cheol yes
why
it s nothing
i m sure i saw it wrong
are you alright
do you think you can stand up
my legs feel weak
i think i sprained my back as well
i ll take you to a hospital
get up
i sent tae yi ryeong to the hospital with one of our employees
the police have been notified
be sure to check if any of our stores acquired any damages before tomorrow s opening
what about the dog
was there no dog
didn t the burglar bring a dog
we checked surveillance videos but he went around without a dog
i guess you were bit by a burglar a person not a dog
honey it s a relief
at least you don t have to get the rabies vaccine ceo please step outside for a moment
what is it
mr ceo there s a dog
it was a petty burglar
there was also a dog
he s right here
right there is what your saying
yes
it s really there a dog
he s a handsome german shepherd
you sit right there
wow you understand commands
paw
he s so smart
he understands everything
did that dog also sneak in here like the burglar to steal something
i m not sure
i think it s correct that he was with the burglar
when the burglar was running away i caught his eye and the dog started to follow me
then is this his collar
pil seung
i think it s right
he s answering to his name
woof woof is what he said
he has the same tag around his neck
if he carried this around while stealing that dog must have meant a lot to him
the whereabouts of the armed soldier who ran away 2 days ago is still unknown
reporter yoo will give us the details
pil seung what should i do
i think the dog wants us to go with him somewhere
i should go and see
mr ceo if you touch me the dog disappears
i need to follow him
what do you mean follow him
tae yi ryeong was attacked by him and is at the hospital
you don t know what will happen to you if you go there
we ve reported him to the police so he ll get caught
let the dog visit him later
don t you think there was a reason why pil seung followed me instead of following his owner
it can be helpful if i find the burglar
i think you ve gone crazy trying to impress sweet candy kang but he s a criminal
where do you think you re going
it s too dangerous
you can t go
don t give me that face
i said no
if i tell you once please listen
i guess i misunderstood you
i thought you would say go chase that dog and find the burglar
did you say you would find the burglar because you wanted to impress me
thank you for worrying about my safety mr ceo
100 000 won
nothing s for free
i m going to deduct it from your paycheck
you said you were going to give me a discount
then 50 000 won
i went through it again but there was no dog recorded
vice president was mistaken
he was bit by the burglar
you re sure there is no dog right
there is none
tae gong shil
what are you doing
about what
i heard yi ryeong got hurt
no she was startled but she didn t get hurt
but
tae gong shil what did you see
huh
i saw you talking with ceo joo
didn t you say that you saw a dog
no one saw the dog and it wasn t even recorded on surveillance
what is it that only you saw
about that actually
ghosts spirits
i hate people going around saying they saw those things they re pathetic i hate them
did you really see a dog
i didn t see it
how could i have seen something that no one else saw
then why did you tell ceo joo that you saw a dog what was that about
um
mr ceo asked me to find someone and gae dog he / she was here before
i wasn t saying a barking dog gae but gae meaning she / he was here
i think you were mistaken
let s just say i was mistaken
but what were you hiding just now
was i mistaken again
how are you going to explain this time
it broke
i m sorry
you were being honest when you gave this to me
but me i m sorry
he was hiding in tae gong shil s office but he wasn t targeting ceo joo
okay i ll keep an eye out
sweet love
i m sorry
no
i m the one who s sorry kang woo
i m sorry i screamed and got mad at you when you talked about ghosts
no no i m sorry
i didn t realize how much you hated ghosts
i m really sorry i talked about ghosts
it s not that i hate ghosts i m afraid
are you that afraid of ghosts
when i was in the army i saw a lot of horrible deaths
i even got counseling at one point because of nightmares
is that so
so when someone says those things are around it s hard to handle
there are none
there is nothing around you
not a single thing
trust me
i m certain
i ll trust you
oh don t put any meaning to the candy breaking
you re supposed to break candies anyways
let s eat it now since it s broken already
shall we
we should take a half each since it s broken like that anyways
it s sweet
you can feel it you re

i don t care how you live but that dog came out in my dream
isn t it just a dog bad dream that everyone dreams of
nobody
♫ i want nobody nobody but you ♪
look at him
pil seung is dancing and also wagging his tail
he s liking it
right
that dog came out in my dream
i don t ever want to dream about a dancing dog
take this and return it to its owner and send the dog
you were holding me back from going saying it s dangerous
i m going to pretend like i didn t see it
i don t want to see it
follow the dog
i ll go with you
you re friendly with the dog
they re tickets to a musical
it s a vvip seat that a salaryman s paycheque can never get
it s a reward for yesterday s incident
it s today
it starts at 9 so it we ll be in time if we meet up at 8 have dinner and a cup of tea
okay
hey
we have to decide where we meet
why do i have to decide that with you
it s a reward
not the ticket but i am
are you going to ask for it back if i decline you
i m showing you my sincerety since it seems rude to just end it with a material
it s fine
i ll go with the person i want to go with
thank you
okay have fun
that dung manner
let s go pil seung
so why did you appear in that dream
what did
what appeared in a dream
a movie
i watched a movie and the scene kept appearing in my dreams
do you like movies
then do you like musicals too
we re off early today
let s go together
okay
but i can t stay in the dark for so long like i might scream and run out of the theatre
it s not a horror musical
and if you get scared you can hold on
let s go
i ll go
it starts at 9 so let s meet in front of the theatre at 8
let s go
it s hot and we can t even drive
why do i have to follow a dog that i don t see
you said you re scared of it appearing in your dreams again
should we just forget about it
go
pil seung is going that way
where are you going
do i see it
i don t see it
how dare you nag me
hurry up
i have an appointment at 8
i have to dress up
you said you re watching a musical with sweet candy kang right
are you even able to watch it until the end
how would you know what s sitting beside you
i m going to sit beside him even if i have to close my eyes
so let s hurry up it s that way
i don t know
it s too hot
i have to drink something cold
ceo
let s hurry up and eat
i want patbingsu
what about you
i don t see those things
two long blacks
wait
i don t want to drink that though
i only drink the one i have decided on
i don t like seeing other people eat something that looks better than mine
then you can also
- get it off
i don t look at menus
long black please
ceo
has hee joo ever appeared in your dreams
like pil seung it would be good if hee joo appeared in your dreams and told you something
that never happened
after that time i don t see hee joo anymore
a ghost appears when someone talks or thinks about them
talk about hee joo to me
i ll listen
i don t have anything to say to you
do you not trust me
are you worried that i ll run off with your money
yeah
i don t trust you
a person creates their weaknesses when they talk about themselves
i don t want you to know any of mine
you don t trust me
the dog s going shall we follow him
let s go
but ceo
the fact that you re coming with me even though you don t see it that s called trust
it s that way let s go
ah yes this is an identification tag of a military dog
then please look into a military dog named pil seung right away
he must be here
if we find who it is we talk about the dog and return this
don t provoke him by lecturing
we re not the police
but it s scary to meet someone who stole something
why
the dog s giving me its hand like this
it must mean that everything s alright
look at him taking the side of his owner
i think it s over there
yes secretary kim
the dog collar that you have is an identification tag of a military dog that has recently been euthanized
a military dog
pil seung you were a military dog
and also the soldier responsible for the military dog has apparently deserted the military and is armed
i think the one that came into kingdom yesterday was the deserter
pil seung
i m going to follow you from here a soldier must have at least one favorite girl group
nobody nobody but you ♫ nobody nobody but you ♫
i want nobody nobody but you ♫ i want nobody nobody but you ♫
i hate love
i hate anyone but you
nobody nobody nobody nobody ♫ nobody nobody nobody nobody i want nobody
are you not going to straighten up
are you a fool
you can t even do it correctly you loser
my vacation time was taken because of you
why do i have to go through all this trouble because of you
go away
you
run in full combat gear until i say stop alright
answer me
- yes
pil seung
if you weren t here i probably couldn t have decided to hang in there until discharge
are you saying it s okay
don t worry
you re all i have
nobody nobody but you
you re the only one i have
pil seung can no longer function as a military dog
we ve decided to euthanize it
if you let it live i ll take care of it until i get discharged
can t you do something
please spare him
you ll be the one performing the euthanasia
hey kim hyeong cheol you re seriously out of your mind aren t you
can t you do it correctly
aren t you going to get up quickly
look down
what are you going to do by staring
woah woah hey
pil seung
i m so scared
i think it came to ask me to stop him from doing dangerous things
secretary kim reported to the police and military that corporal kim is here
the fact that he has a gun means we shouldn t follow him any further
come out
they ll be here any minute
shouldn t we persuade him before they get here
you i think you don t get it because all you see every day are dead people
but he has a gun
a gun if we intervene at the wrong time we could get killed
pil seung is crying
it s crying
that person must be crying too
tae gong shil
you said even if you see them you can decide to ignore them
i was going to do that but i can t do it well
you can not see them
hold it
you said you had a date at 8 o clock didn t you
right now go home and neatly wash your hair get dressed properly and put on a make-up too
get there on time as a normal woman
you always ask me to hold you so you can do that
i ll hold you so hold me
let s go
i guess i m just a hopelessly crazy girl
i ll be right back
tae gong shil

he s a dead dog
i see that dead dog
pil seung s beside me
yeah
it s a very handsome and smart german shepherd
is it your taste of liking nobody
i played it for him everyday
because we re fans of wonder girls
that friend was by your side all this time
he wants to protect you so you won t do anything dangerous
pil seung died because i was an idiot and he protected such a person like me
that dog is giving you a hand like this
are you telling me that everything s alright
i don t have anyone but you
pil seung are you telling me that everything s alright
corporal kim has disarmed himself and surrendered
no civilians were hurt and the incident was resolved
anyways i will send a situation report to the police since he was also hiding in kingdom
it s a relief that there were no damages
he apparently was a soldier taking care of military dogs
does that mean the dog was with him
i don t know about that but i m just relieved that everyone seems unharmed
i want nobody nobody nobody nobody thanks
i m sorry for alarming you two
we re alright
but what brings you mr ceo all the way here for
we were supposed to see you for entering the kingdom
i came here to buy some couches
i see you are satisfied with what we set up for you at your home
there are still cameras outside right
we re just going sit here until they are all gone
alright
if you two are looking for beds as well it s that way
it s fine
you may go now
alright
ceo you were really good at it
it looked as if you actually see it
i ve seen you do it a couple of times
but are you going to keep the promise you made with the soldier
wait
it s going to be hard getting back up from a slanted life with only a dog ghost s comfort
i m kingdom s ceo
if you come back without any trouble i ll give you a job
don t forget about pil seung
that dog ghost is very smart
he didn t only drag you into this but also dragged me in and gave him a path for the future
i m very glad that i didn t ignore it
you
next time when i tell you to leave you immediately get lost
and when i tell you don t go don t ever go
yes
it s too cramped go over there
ceo read this
what is it it s a confirmation document to confirm that you were not hurt and you are not planning to sue the store in the future after today s incident
i don t mind but you re strict with these kind of things
you can read it over and sign it
it s a tissue that wipes their mouth after scaring me
read it
i already read it
you can read it and sign it
do you know how much my signatures cost
i can t do it thoughtlessly
you read every single line
it s not like you don t know how to read read it by yourself
forget it
i can tell secretary kim to do it
ceo can you not read words
it s that i don t read i can t read words
it somehow just happened that way
why
did you find a weakness
after that incident it somehow became this way
when i was being locked they made me read books
by a psycho
the book that i had to read was about people continuously being killed
i wondered who would be killed next as i read through every single line
and then wondered who would be killed next again
then i felt like when everyone is dead after the book is finished it would be me that would be killed last
anyways i lived
however after that every time i see words i feel like throwing up
i m scared of reading words
what can we do
how should we solve this
what do you mean how
why are you so worried when you can t do anything
that s what i mean it would still be a help if i can say if you re scared hold onto me
do you want to hold onto me just in case
i don t need it
then
i ll help you read from now on
i don t need that either
secretary kim does that
secretary kim s recording was what you were always plugged into
i ll read this for you

episode 7
mr ceo
he said this is the copy of the agreement you signed he said we should divide it up and each take a copy
also he gave this
he said we should each take one as a pair
it s a souvenir gift that the furniture store hands out to its customers
let s divide it up and take one each
why do i have to divide this with you
i don t want to become involved with you as a pair
it s very cool
put it away
yes alright
why haven t you left
why are you still standing here
aren t you going to give me a ride
i m too tired today
i almost got shot while being involved with you
i m sorry mr ceo
i think it s dangerous for me to get dragged into the world you see
i shouldn t go any further
there needs to be a firm line between you and me
are you saying you ll draw a line and tell me to get lost
let s just keep focused on each other s uses
from now on from here to there is tae gong shil s zone
if you need a safety hideout instead of talking to me just touch me here and leave
talk to me only when you see something that is useful to me like cha hee joo
to me talking to you about random things made me feel better
i don t like it so stick to the rules
i ll give you the tae gong shil zone however don t try to touch other places
there are no eyes ears or mouth on this arm so don t expect me to see hear or talk
mr ceo i talked to you because you re not scared of ghosts
that s right
i m not scared of ghosts
i m afraid of you tae gong shil
is taeyang not coming with us
she says she has a date
let s go
yes
well he did almost get shot because of me it s understandable that he thinks i m dangerous
tae gong shil
oh it s you yi ryeong
hi
did you come to see a musical
yep
you too
i m leaving but i just saw something very interesting
ok
well bye then
you know i thought you were going to pretend that you didn t see me
thanks for saying hi - it was so good to see you
bye small taeyang sun
ok good luck big taeyang sun
i guess big taeyang has no grasp of what s going on
per my client s orders i am keeping a close eye on people approaching ceo joo
tae gong shil is one of them
so you ve been friendly with her because you want to investigate her
i m doing this to protect ceo joo
from now on don t interfere and interrupt my job
i won t interrupt
you said you were watching the musical with gong shil right
do your job well
i guess she came here thinking it was a date
too bad big taeyang
kang woo
are you angry that i m late
i think it just started should we go in
let s not watch this
why
i heard it s not funny
i heard it is funny
people say it s not funny
right now i don t want to see people acting about something that isn t real
let s do something else
honestly i didn t want to be in a dark place either
then what should we do
let s do what you want to do
i ll follow you without asking any questions
you signed this
did you check the details
yes
tae gong shil read it for me
did you tell her about your dyslexia did you tell her that you couldn t read
yes
i am not going to be dragged along by tae gong shil anymore
after almost getting shot i gave her a warning
you must have been so shocked
will a single anti-anxiety pill be good enough
this will be enough
tae gong shil also has a copy so if you think there will be a problem call her immediately
i ll do it tomorrow
you said she was on a date
i can t call her and ruin it
that muscial we were going to invite it to the kingdom s fall cultural event
i guess it s a fun show
there s no way she can properly sit and watch
she s either going to run out screaming something jumped out at her or chase after something she finds pitiful
it s going to be one of those
you re wrong
if she had a problem you would have received a call
seeing how it s quiet the date is going well
tae yang is being too selfish
going on a date when master is here in shock and taking an anti-anxiety pill
well i guess she can t skip her date even if she begins to worry about you
have some rest
is there something wrong
i guess you catch colds in the summer if you re old
i ll set an appointment with the doctor so go straight to the hospital
secretary kim you can never be sick
of course i can t get sick until i find someone to replace me
ugh it s bitter
now that i have taken an anti-anxiety pill i need to sleep
while someone is having a hard time sleeping even after taking a bitter anti-anxiety pill i guess someone is fine and enjoying a sweet time
i came here because you didn t have a particular place you wanted to go
is this place okay
oh it s the han river
it s my first time here since the incident when i was here eating chicken with my sister and almost got dragged into the water
did you almost drown in the water
yes
kang woo let s not get too close to the water
then do you want to go over there to the fountain show
yes let s go
oh my
aren t you going
kang woo let s go that way
the bridge is that way
in that direction there is a bicycle rent shop
do you want to ride a bike
yes
let s go that way
is the breeze cool
yes
[ no leave ]
kang woo can t you go faster
hurry kang woo
it was fun riding on a bicycle because it has been a while since i last rode it
should we come back here later to ride it again
i told you i don t like it
why do you keep on asking that
if you don t like it never mind

why did you come
because i feel sorry
then shall we drink this while we re at the water show
let s go
i really hate water ghosts
please don t come out
please
please don t come out
the water ghost was way too scary
he wouldn t have followed me right
would he
that s right
i am not afraid of ghosts
i am afraid of you tae gong sil
he s probably afraid of being bothered with ghostly incidents because of me
hello mr ceo
i was just debating whether to call you or not just in case some ghost followed me
drop that
i only called for a business matter
i m thinking of inviting that musical team you watched today to the autumn festival
report how good they were
i couldn t watch that today
you couldn t watch it
we just went to the han river to get fresh air
oh yeah
but a running ghost kept chasing me
it was hard to pretend to look normal
i knew it would have happened
and also we went to see the water show
a water ghost kept jumping in and out of the water
you have no idea how scared i was
so i thought of calling you just in case that ghost followed me here
but you called me right on time
i am very grateful
i didn t call to make you grateful
and also i told you not to say things like that to me didn t i
okay if you didn t see the musical get lost no
tae gong shil will also need that bitter medicine
i m sleepy
i only got to communicate with the hide-out and i feel much less scared
there is tae gong shil zone i m not allowed to touch anywhere else
but that zone is too small isn t it
rock paper scissor
rock paper scissor

you are going to bother seung joon here again huh
come out

mr ceo
i discovered this
what is this
there are weird kids in here
but
no it s not because i am scared of this
then leave
but mr ceo -
inside the tae gong shil zone no conversation continues after but away you go
vanish
tae gong shil what are you doing
why are you putting it here
this is a bit dangerous so i was going to leave it here for a while
why would you leave something dangerous here
to put me in danger
you aren t scared of things like this at all
there are three children ghosts in here
tae gong shil i almost got shot yesterday
at a time like this you should bring vitamins and say
mr ceo i slept well yesturday
before you sleep you should have taken anti-anxiety pills or if not you can t bring three ghosts here
i can do that
am i allowed to worry about you
i thought you hated me worrying about you so i didn t say those things
am i allowed to
yes tell me
since my ears have holes i have no other choice but to listen
mr ceo did you have a good sleep
you were surprised a lot yesterday right
i carry this with me because this is effective after i see scary ghosts
please take this mr ceo
is this approved by the food and drugs administration
i bought it from a pharmacy
i will share it with you from now on
from now on forever are you telling me to be shocked together with you
while i used to be scared alone now that i have you next to me i don t think i need this medication as much
also this dangerous doll please keep an eye on it since you are the most safe person at kingdom
you say it s dangerous
scary and dangerous things are supposed to be guarded by the security team
shouldn t you give it to kang candy
i can t do that to him
he really hates these things
what if it scares him too much
if he gets scared feed him this and with that get lost
he designated a tae gong shil zone on you
yes but it s too small
it will get bigger
this is what you asked me for
yes
so this is what the ceo was looking for so much
it does look like it s worth 10 billion won
that s cha hee joo
she was even prettier when she was alive
she s pretty
what is this
she left it here
when things are sweet for tae gong shil why do i feel bitter
ah it s bitter
too bitter
i have to look for someone other than you guys
don t make me waste time and come out quickly
you guys are bad kids bothering good kids right
tell me why you re doing bad deeds
you re not going to talk
come out
come out
come out come out
i told you to come out
come out already
tae gong shil
what are you doing with that doll
you can t be actually talking with a doll can you
i know everything
i ve seen you do it a few times
you saw everything
you tae gong shil have even talked to a trashcan and conversed with pictures on the walls
you saw all of that
there was someone like that in my high school
he even named his pencil and talked to it
do you know where he is now
a mental hospital
he works for nasa
he used to say he would make spaceships to get to andromeda
he is really making it
i guess you are really imaginative like him
that s right
imaginative
drink some coffee
coffee coffee you look quite dark hello
have a nice conversation and if black coffee doesn t suit you please add some cream
thank you
andromeda
a man i met at a hospital once told me that he met an alien there
don t tell kang woo that you ve been going in and out of the hospital and the police station
although i can t tell him about ghosts because it will bother him shouldn t i tell him about other things
i was so thankful and happy when someone told me they liked me but i feel bad to deceive someone like this
gong shil you told me that you are doing much better these days
do things like that still appear
they don t just not appear
what doesn t
lee han cheol
what are you doing
why is tae gong shil always like that
i told you not to scare gong shil like a ghost
am i a ghost
- this is a nosebleed isn t it
- no
but i i think i just got a nosebleed
didn t i get a nosebleed from tae gong shil hitting me
this is assault
absolutely crazy
i m telling you that s not it snot came out snot
blow hard but it doesn t feel like snot
aigoo
i can t watch you get arrested for assault
i was so shocked for no reason
why aren t you going to her
even to you me going over there and asking what happened has that become something that is expected of me
didn t you always go when tae yang was like that
always going going too much
i won t go anymore
this year s summer event -
sorry
they re very favorable- -
if you are not feeling well go to the hospital again
no it s nothing i have documents and articles i must show you today
secretary kim are you okay
master joo can t you call someone to take over for me just for today
who
i have experience as a secretary
but back then the ghost next to the president with an ax sticking out of his head kept appearing so i quit
an axe
did you work in a gangster s office
no it was a small but normal finance company
what s the name of the company
sera finance
last year the president there was arrested for instigating murder
really
while you see ghosts do you not watch the news
the stuff in the news and papers are supposed to be all true but after seeing ghosts i found out that not all of it is true
earlier this year there was an artist who appeared in the newspaper for winning a global award
but it turns out that artist stole his dead friend s painting
that artist is
don t tell me
know it for yourself and get away
i just want to know that there is an artist in korea who is good enough to win a big award and end it at that
true or not just read the newspaper you have
okay i don t know if it s true but kingdom s children s summer event is receiving a big response from consumers
that s true
good keep reading
tae gong shil is taking secretary kim s spot right now
really
that girl will eventually become ceo joo s weakness
if the aunt disapproves won t the father disapprove as well
the person that the ceo hates the most is probably his father
i don t know if it s the truth or not but there were rumors that the reason that girl died was because of the ceo s father
at that time there were rumors that because my brother didn t pay the ransom the girl named hee joo died
although it is a ridiculous story
of course it is
what father wouldn t pay the ransom if he knew that his son could get killed
i hope joo won thinks that way
for me my brother going overseas is to find the lost jewelry and fix any misunderstandings
we ll see if my guess is right or wrong
why are you keep watching on your son
it seems like he would have seen the culprit of the incident but he s insisting he didn t see
whether that s true or not i don t know
are you afraid that the criminal would do something to your son
while secretary kim is sick and left his position open
tae gong shil is sticking to him instead
i told you they have that kind of relationship
don t go around recklessly spreading things you don t know the truth about
chief please escape the dark-circled tae yang who is more riddling than the mystery circle
poor you
ah
during the executive meeting be sure to listen well and organize information
do you want me to read the documents that were organized earlier
it s fine
i memorized it all
if i don t want to read it i need to really concentrate and fill it up
since i ve been following you all day i realize that you are quite busy
even while saying ceo ceo
you hardly recognize that i m the ceo of this place
i thought you were idle because you always looked through the telescope in the office
you have lots of work
what are you always looking at through that
you always talked about the world you see
are you only now curious about the world i see
take a look
start it
from now i will introduce the business plan for kingdom in shanghai
to describe the current situations of domestic shopping malls that have branched out to shanghai there are a total of 7 businesses currently operating in shanghai
most of them are congregated in the taipan area and as you can see in the reports two businesses have already succeeded in settling and they re considering expanding the business
the rest of the businesses are in the phase of developing the business plan just like us and they re researching the marketability
go on please
ah yes
currently the rest businesses are researching the marketability in that area
currently the marketplaces market share is thanks for what you did earlier mr ceo
that s because we agreed to do what s needed for each other
my head hurts from memorizing all that like crazy
as for the meeting i ll organize the contents and give it to secretary kim when he s here
can i see through that just once
if you look this way it s my competitor
if you look that way it s a car entering kingdom
and this way it s a car exiting kingdom
i can see everything
what i control and belong to is kingdom
i m already busy trying to make it more perfect
why
did you see something again
i just remembered the long-haired ghost whom i saw earlier at the conference room
i was about to scream but thanks to you the meeting ended well
tae gong shil it must have ended well for you since the hideout came when you caught something on the radar
you there s another thing you thoroughly ignore other than the fact that i m the ceo
i don t ignore you though
no you are
the fact that your safety hideout is a man you re thoroughly ignoring that
that s
if you think the safety hideout is a man you can t barge in asking to sleep together just holding hands so you must think i m a concrete or something
anyway the conference room earlier wasn t quiet at all and ever since you came my world has been continuously noisy
i just barged in to survive but i didn t realize i was complicating your situation
well as for that part i already decided to live with it when i stationed you so i ll take care of that on my own
it s time for the kids mall event
let s go
think of him as concrete concrete
mr ceo
i would still feel very sorry about calling you just concrete
you re marble of the best quality
are you calling that a compliment
i m saying i treasure you that much
marble
this isn t just regular marble
it s the world s most expensive marble
something you could never have if you were just a regular woman
i had it available to you because of your special radar
just one span
he keeps emphasizing it
just one span
you re working aren t you
keeping surveillance
i m not keeping surveillance but i m being jealous
hmm
watching the girl i m interested in go out with another man is jealousy
you said you lied to her that you like her
i didn t say it s still the case
but why do you keep showing up in front of me
are you monitoring me
or
or what
what
do you think i m following you around because i like you
why would i
i m a top star
top celebrity
and you re just a salaried man
if you re a top star isn t it supposed to be hard to see you often
since i get to see it too often you look just like a neighborhood girl
where s that neighborhood
if i was a neighborhood girl is an ahjussi won bin and a grandma go doo shim in that neighborhood
miss top star tae yi ryeong you look prettier on tv than up close so don t come out so often
does that mean
i look so so in real life
does that what it means
he s confusing me somehow
is he saying i m pretty or not so much
as for tae gong shil is he monitoring her or being jealous
my contact lenses float around when i use my brain
ah
you seem to like kids
do you know how many wallets open per one kid
mom dad paternal grandparents maternal grandparents 6 at least
and when you add the aunts and uncles to that the consumption power gets very very very enormous
in our study motel there s a kid who plays with a doll picked up on the street because he has only 1 wallet - his mom
if that bothers you why don t you open up your wallet and buy a toy
i ll buy it somewhere else
did she just curse
i can t even throw away that doll what to do
mom the bag is missing
i think i lost it
go find it
who are you
hello
let s be friends
take us with you
you re the same as us
huh
it s that doll
a doll
the doll that kid with a yellow t-shirt is holding it s the doll i brought isn t it
why is he taking that
what should i do
the kids in there will harass him like they did to seung joon
walk fast
you should be scolded at home for losing the bag
his mother is a member of our department store so i looked up the address
but is that doll that important
yes
i have to find it
i m off from work soon
let s go and find it together afterwards
this is an urgent matter so i have to get it right now
weren t you working for ceo joo instead of secretary kim today
is it okay for you to just leave for the doll
ceo understands what i do
i ll be leaving now
he understands her action of leaving the work to find a doll
president joo does
because of that doll a kid that lives in my house got sick
are you sure that it s because of that doll
i am sure
that kid who took it will be sick too
this is kingdom
did your child maybe take a doll from here
a doll
why
i m not trying to blame you
there is some problems with that doll so i ll be there to pick it up
he didn t take such a thing
he lost his bag at kingdom though
why don t you find that for me instead
well
hold on hello
he took it
why is she lying that he didn t
do you think that kid might be hiding the doll
stop
if it s not going to harm kingdom stop it there
i have the address
can you please go with me
tae gong shil i told you i would only allow this much for you
don t think of dragging me around
do you think my mom is mad
what should i do
you
do you know what you did wrong
mom i m sorry
you didn t find the doll no
you said that the kid lost a bag right
this is a lost item reported today
do you think this is his
it is
so his name is chang min
let s go together after work
i can buy a better doll for him
i ll see you later
thank you
she will let me in if i tell her that i found the bag right
there is a good artist that i m planning to buy some pieces from
do you also want to buy some
who is it
baek hwang sul who won a prestigious world-wide award this year
the artist who was on the newspaper for receiving a global award actually stole his dead friend s work
is it that person
the price will go up
it d be better to buy them now
if i didn t know i would ve never hesitated about this good investment
why
you aren t going to buy
i will think about it a little more
even if that artist is baek hwang sul i m still going to buy it
i m only checking because i feel uncomfortable
tae gong shil
where did she go
what is this
is it that kid s
come out
i know you aren t bad kids
come out

what is it now
kingdom s child psychologist that obligates to reporting child abuse has reported you for child abuse
child psychologist
who is that
me
and the kingdom lawyer claims that what our ceo and worker has done during the process of rescuing an abused child was not an intentional assault
kingdom lawyer
me
your son will be in treatment while you are being investigated then he will be sent to child protection institution
why do you care what i do to my child
and someone can hit their child once a wh -
a mosquito was sucking on you
it hurts
you know what it feels like to hurt
let s go
what did i do wrong
kingdom will pay for all the medical expenses and protection fees
please look closely into any more marks of abuse
ceo joo joong won is at the police station

i don t know
but why would a person like ceo joo be there
i m helping you out
do you want to go together
hey
let s go togeth -
kingdom corporation attorney will solve it
let s go
what about me
mr ceo are you not taking me
i didn t want to tell you because you might get angry but there s a lady beside me
i m scared
mr ceo
i have something to take care of
you should head first
i m sorry mr ceo
i m really sorry
you don t have to be sorry
you did well tae gong shil
thank you for telling me that i did well
you re hurt
oh this i think i got scratched while fighting that lady
that son s mom should really be punished
she made her own child in that state but now she made another person s child look like this
tae yang let s go to the hospital
warmth spreads ceo joo came to the police station because of tae gong shil
doesn t get any closer cha hee joo
lonely love yes i love you like my destiny i don t go to the hospital that often so i always had to hold the pain in
i m glad that i came to the hospital with you mr ceo
i m also glad that i got to take a tour around the detention cell thanks to tae gong shil
but why is heat rising inside of me
is that so
would you like to use this then
it s the one you got as a pair
oh right
you said you don t want to be related as a pair
it s cool though right
mr ceo it s not tae gong shil zone here
it s already a used body
just use it
i didn t do that because of a ghost
i just got a headache because i think i hit my head too hard
it s okay you don t have to hold me
just use it as a prevention since your headache is going to worsen if you see anymore ghosts in that state
i m giving you a reward for doing well today
this is expensive
i thought you d never let me lay a hand on you back in the cell
it kind of feels weird to hear you tell me to use it since i did well
when an insane sun rose in my world i was trying anything to get you out
however i realized that i was actually the one being dragged into your gloomy world
i was struggling to stop and get out but i realized in the cell today i already
you wanted to be beside me right
congratulations
you succeeded
secretary kim s probably here by now
let s go
mr ceo
i get a weird thing on my radar
so use it
it must be you for me you don t feel a thing when i touch you like this right right
do you really think i m an air-raid shelter made out of marble
if you love me that can t be true
you re like the wind that disappears when i get closer
preview
you ve seen a water ghost right
i ve seen
there s a lady over there
go catch it
i can t catch it
tae gong shil
tae gong shil where are you going
you touch me too much
are you possessed
when you truly don t like it pain answers
where did you hear that
kang woo
cha hee joo
did you arrange this for me
my heart flutters
i don t think you re hurt because of me
i feel happy
i don t have to be sorry that much right
what if i go closer
i have to be careful
i like it too much
i was just going to get you a glass of water or something
no it s okay
i don t need any
i ve been on the lookout and i don t see cha hee joo anywhere near you
i guess she went to the person that she needs to protect
for the past 15 years it was her fear that i might find out who the kidnapper was that made her stop by once in awhile just to keep an eye on me
why didn t you tell anyone else that cha hee joo was part of the kidnapping
i would ve told others had she survived
and i would ve done whatever i could to make sure that she was captured
i would ve just hated her
but she died right in front of my eyes
when i thought about how she was used and abandoned by someone else there was a part of me that felt bad for her
but then the other kidnapper that she was with is someone that she needs to protect
i ve finally realized how i was completely deceived by her
fifteen years ago i didn t come to my senses after being smacked in the head now after another slap to the face i am completely smacked awake
it must ve been so difficult for you
you told me that it was okay for me to worry about you and to comfort you
how difficult it must ve been you couldn t even tell the truth
i know that covering up your scars only makes the pain that much worse
the trauma from that experience still prohibits you from being able to read too
that bitch
i promise to cuss her out for you
if i ever see hee joo again i m going to do it properly
you re such an awful bitch
my ten billion won radar you re more useful that i thought
i m not worth the ten billion anymore
i haven t even been able to find anything about where your money is hidden
i m sure that the necklace is in your kidnapper s possession
my ransom that they demanded are you sure that you paid it
you can believe whatever you want
it s possible that even that could ve been just another perfect crime
if we can t locate that lost necklace he told me that he won t tell me anything in regards to cha hee joo
it sounds like he no longer wants to put his trust in me
i should ve moved a bit faster
i m sorry
i was planning on going back to korea soon anyways
i m sure that his story will change once he takes a look at this
then i ll take my leave from kingdom enterprises now
no don t do that i want you to stay there until i get back
now that president joo knows i don t think i ll be able to stay here
no i m the one who started all this
if i know anything about my son i don t think that he ll fire you
i m sure that he ll just ignore everything
i m sure he thinks that i ll just ignore it and leave team leader kang alone
my father is the type of person who ll antagonize me even more and then run away if he sees me squirming in my seat
but if i ignore it with just the right amount he ll come to me on his own and say whatever it is that he has to say
i m someone who believes that playing hard to get is important whether it s with a woman or with your own son
i have to stay in spain until after i celebrate maria s birthday
i ll see you when i return kang woo
i invited my friends to my birthday party and all of them are coming
will the friends that you went on this trip with be coming too
yes
then is it possible that at least one of them will remember this woman
yes
you just wait until i see you again
i need you to explain everything to me
he s really struggling right now
i m sure he didn t want to hear those words
if your father finds out where the necklace is what would happen to ms tae
then i wouldn t have anymore use for her
things have been livelier around here since ms tae appeared
i guess things will quiet back down again
did president joo joong won tell you about me
yes
i was investigating you to see if you had any involvement with cha hee joo
is that why you kept asking me about my relationship with president joo
i misunderstood that and thought that you were just being jealous
- i m sorry
- if that was the case it would ve been better if you had just been honest and asked me outright
i would ve made it easier for everyone and just told you what was going on
kang woo i ll tell you everything
first let s go to that dark corner over there
i think team leader kang purposely approached ms tae with an ulterior motive but it doesn t seem like ms tae is angry about it
even though she doesn t let too many things get to her i m sure that it s still upsetting for her
what is it that you re looking for
you can t see it with your eyes
if i say the wrong thing everyone s going to think that president joo and i are both crazy
so i m searching for just the right thing
kang woo i see things that others can t see
i can see ghosts
when normal people feel a cool breeze of air or a sudden chill i can see and hear what they are
tae gong shil are you just trying to frighten me by telling me these scary stories because you re mad at me
i wasn t going to say anything because i know how scared you are of them but i can t explain my relationship with president joo unless i tell you about this
in order for me to converse with the late cha hee joo i ve been staying close to president joo s side all this time
you see dead people and you talk to them
i think that grandmother just recently lost her beloved cat
a pretty white cat is sitting beside her right now
i don t see any cats
but i see it
grandmother by any chance did you used to have a cat
yes i did but my cat died recently
my little cutie she was white as fresh fallen snow
since i have no use for her i should get her out of here
is she crying
she s sleeping
i thought she was crying
i guess she wasn t that upset
is something here
don t awake her
she needs sleep so that she can look out for ghosts and hear them out
just leave her alone when she s sleeping
this is the defense shield zone
where is it
get lost
i just i just wanted to create a space for you where you could breathe
well
i guess there is some use for her after all
pervert
that was a good nap
have you been there long
why didn t you wake me up like you usually do
okay
that looks good
here
does he make you deliver too now
all the ghosts love me too much
the scary lady that came to see me told me that i have this bright aura around me which draws all ghosts to me
hey
what s good about being popular amongst ghosts
i guess
even that lady told me to be careful
make sure to be careful so that you re not swallowed up by them
what does she mean swallowed up
it means that a dead person might want to use my body to come back to the living
what is this
did you follow me all the way here just because i said something to you
but it still doesn t matter because i can t see or hear you
you don t scare me one bit
if a ghost wants to borrow my body to relay a message that they want do you think that i should let them borrow it
you must be completely out of your mind
i normally don t like to tell you that you re crazy but that s just pure crazy talk okay
right
if i do that and they completely take over my body then that means i ll have to die
i don t want that
honey it s me
let me play the song that i practiced today for you
i hope you like it
it s been a month now right
i think that man believes that his wife will come back to life
my concert is coming up soon
i need you
come back to me
there s a lot of interest about this world renowned pianist ruijjang
this cultural event is going to give our kingdom more of a luxurious image
i booked him
i heard that he hasn t moved his fingers since his wife s death
have you met with him directly to verify that for yourself
it s not ruibang it s ruijjang
and he can move his fingers just fine
i saw that for myself
since joong won is busy with the business deal with the chinese i need you to work with ruibang yourself
i m going to get rid of bang shil while joong won is gone
how many times have i told you that it s not bang
i love you
i calculated tae gong shil s usefulness to me
are you trying to get rid of your radar now
why do you think that i m going to get rid of you
you told me that i d be worthless if i couldn t find your money and you told me that you d kick me out once i become worthless
yes i did
so how much do you think that you re worth
if i m to be generous about it and say that i m getting paid as much as what the customer representatives gets paid and if i deduct the defensive shield usage then i m sure that i ll be in the negative
you want to calculate your worth in money
so you have learned a few things from me
then have you checked your bank account recently i m sure your paycheck must ve been deposited in there
the deposited amount in your account is
president joo
i ve paid you according to the work you ve done
you were instrumental in getting the chairman to invest in my company and i ve just paid you for the difference you made by taking care of the hotel problem
even after your usage of the defensive shield has been deducted there s still quite a bit left isn t there
your worth is still in the positive
when you re no longer in the positive that s when you re out of here
thank you
if i keep up at this rate i may be able to catch a few more ghosts and even buy myself a house
you were you planning to quietly go away if i had told you to get out of here
it doesn t really hurt my feelings when you tell me to get lost every day
so i could ve just continued to stick by your side like i do now
but if you had told me to get lost this time
if i had told you to get lost i m sure you would ve just stuck to me again because i have to say it at least three times before you actually do go away
you re right
but if you truly want me out of your life i ll recognize that at once and get out of your life then
so all this time you ve been ignoring what i said like you d ignore a barking dog
get lost
thank you
chief secretary kim i ve hit the lottery today
have you known about this
president joo is the one who got lucky all thanks to the work you ve done
this is all thanks to you
if anything ever bothers you in your sleep all you have to do is tell me about it
- i ll help you out
- thank you
hello
why do you keep that tacky tae gong shil around when you re dating tae yi ryung
it seems you must be mistaken about something
tae yi ryung is the just little sun and tae gong shil is the big sun
are you taking her side right now
if it bothers you that much feel free to call out whomever you want and set up a dinner date
- i ll come meet them for dinner
- in that case when you go to china for your business trip i want you to meet with park seo hyun of sejin construction who is there studying abroad right now
she s the one that we were planning set you up with but it fell though when she broke her leg at the ski lodge awhile back
you remember don t you
okay i ll meet her
will that make you feel better
that s right
the big sun won t be rising in china right
according to the weather reports it s supposed to storm during my trip
then i guess we won t be seeing any sun
i heard that there s going to be some strong rainfall over here too
ahh that s hot
kang woo are you struggling with something
the dead cat really was white
i was up all night thinking about that and i wasn t able to sleep a wink
i m sorry
i really wasn t going to say anything because i didn t want to scare you
is it in here too
do you always have those things around you
well a little
but they re not always so scary
they re ghosts but it doesn t mean that they re always dripping in blood with their hollowed out eye sockets those aren t the only ones that are around
that s enough
okay i understand
please don t tell me anymore about it
okay i won t say anything else
if it s too difficult for you to handle then ignore everything that i ve told you just think of me as living in my own little world and just ignore me and everything else that you ve learned
how is it that president joo joong won believes in what you say
because president joo is a very special person to me
but if i ignored everything then i probably wouldn t know what your world is like right
even though i can t force you to believe me i have nothing to do with those culprits
i just need to keep my eye out for hee joo
i ll keep my eye on you
i ll just consider my fear my punishment for lying to you and i ll find a way to handle it
when he s that frightened
i can t exactly just ask him to trust me
what should i do
hey what s wrong with you
it s a human being
no i m not a human being i m a goddess
hey salary man
your face isn t looking so good
you were too excited to sleep all night because a goddess asked you to date her right
goddess is a form of ghost too right
i really hate things like that
leave
well if you re that burdened by it then i ll just be a regular human being instead of a goddess for you
aren t you going to go investigate tae gong shil today
i don t have to do that anymore
- we know everything about each other now
- it s all over darn i was having fun with it
then let s go out to dinner somewhere as a way to celebrate our first day of dating
who says we re dating
i told you that i didn t want to date you
even if you say that and try to play hard to get you re ultimately still going to fall for me
and when we look back on this later on today will ultimately become the first day of us starting to date
is that so
then let s say that we re dating but i want us to break up now
tae yi ryung
even though it s only been a day i mean a minute and 37 seconds i still want to thank you for all the lovely memories
i hope that you ll be happy
ugh why is it so difficult to seduce that salary man
that noise did you hear that
yes i just hearing something chime
i wonder if someone s in there playing with the piano
we should go check it out
team leader kang did you feel that sudden chill
go check over there
- i ll go check the auditorium
- okay
this is driving me crazy
who s there
who s there
my hand my hand
team leader kang
my hand
isn t this the pianist who s having the concert here soon
my hand
i came to check the condition of the piano that i ll be performing on but your security team member came up and attacked me and this is what he did to my hand
i really am sorry for what he did
but according to our head security he said he didn t attack you severely enough to hurt your hand like that
this hand is used to perform a very delicate performance but i can t move my hand anymore
i can t go on with my concert
this is seriously going to drive me crazy
i heard that ruijjang person has been in a major slump ever since his wife died
i think that he s just lying to get out of playing at his concert
i think that team leader kang woo is being played
how did team leader kang fall into his play
the atmosphere that night was very eerie and something about it felt creepy
team leader kang was for some reason very tense and nervous
a condition unlike how he normally is
my name is tae gong shil and i m a member of a special customer service here at kingdom
i was wondering if i could talk to you for a moment
i have nothing to say
i can see you
you re ruijjang s wife right
it s the shape of a sun
what is
this necklace
i m sure having this as a talisman would put ms tae more at ease
a talisman
ms tae came to me earlier and said something peculiar to me
this is the pen that president joo uses every day to sign his documents right
will it be alright if i keep this with me while he s away on his business trip
i think keeping this with me as a talisman is going to help me feel more secure
she was acting like she was fine but i guess she is worried about being here without me
if you gave her one of those instead of that pen
i m sure it would make ms tae very happy
during the ancient times the sun used to be the ultimate god it was always revered
let s go
why did i buy this
this really doesn t add up
what are you doing here
didn t chief secretary kim tell you
tell me what
when i went to talk to chief secretary kim he told me that you d have it he told me to come over and talk to you about it
there s no way chief secretary kim could ve seen it - i bought it on my own
- but you have it right
then please excuse me
i didn t buy it because of you
i m not giving it to you
what are you talking about
the talisman
the talisman
did you buy a talisman because you re afraid of the ghosts
i have several at home
you could ve just asked me for one
then why are you here
i m going to try and see if i can take care of ruijjang s problem
i met his wife
she came over here with me
why would she come here with you
i need to make something with her but i needed an oven
chief secretary kim told me to come ask you if i can use yours
and when you open your door and let me in i thought you knew that i was coming over
that s what this is about
but how much did you pay for your talisman
i don t know
the oven is over there so use it however you d like
roll this out
i thought this is what she came here for and i let her in the kitchen without even realizing what i was doing
did you crack all the walnuts
i m cracking them right now
walnut this is your lucky day
do you know how expensive this thing is
she told me that ruijjang is a very sensitive person
she told me that he followed a strict regiment before his concerts
and it was his wife who took care of all that for him
he didn t like smelling like food when he d perform his concert so the only thing he would eat is a pie that she d baked with a lot of cinnamon
his wife stayed in his shadow she always took care of her difficult and picky husband
if i bring him a pie baked using his wife s recipe she told me that the misunderstanding with kang woo could be resolved
so ultimately all of this was to help your kang candy
i told him about my ghosts and i think it really shocked kang woo
you should be angry after finding out the real identity of your kang candy
instead you want to help him out
kang woo apologized to me for what he did i do feel bad for telling him something that he really didn t want to know
wouldn t you be suffering a loss as well if this concert gets canceled
that s why i cracked all these walnuts for you
will this be thick enough for the crust
it needs to be thinner
why is she being so picky
why did you have to touch me
i was talking to her and now she s disappeared
are you getting angry with me right now
you re the one who s always touching me to chase away all the ghosts
now you re getting mad at me because i chased away one of your ghosts
i m sorry
i was just caught off guard because she disappeared while i was talking to her
she told me that he s a really picky person and that he probably won t eat it if the pie tastes a slightest bit different
i m sorry
just drink a glass of this and tell that lady to come and bake it herself
i was told doing that could be dangerous if things go wrong i could lose my body to them forever
don t ever drink from now on if it s that dangerous then don t ever drink again
okay
you re back
how should i do this
please watch yourself
honey and cinnamon
kang woo
salary man
i heard you got yourself into trouble
- are you worried that you might get fired
- go away i m not in the mood
just get yourself fired
i d love it if you became my personal bodyguard
you just say whatever it is that you want no matter what the other person is feeling
you live in a peculiar world
i thought you were worrying about losing your job and i just said it to comfort you
did what i say upset you
i just don t get the world of a salary man
listen if you come to like someone who lives in a world different than yours what do you think you ll do
i d first make an effort not to like that person
- and if that doesn t work
- then you have to jump in all the way
something really scary that you never even would ve fathomed could jump out at you - could that be handled
- then just like the person even more
if you like someone a whole lot then you can t see anything else
when you like someone that much how can you even notice anything scary lurking around
you re right
i just need to like her even more
that s rather simple
i don t like you that much yet
that s a relief
i came here out of my concern for you but you re leaving now that you re done speaking
if i follow him now then it means i like him too much
i don t like you that much
no i don t
president joo do you think he ll come when we call him
i m sure he ll be angry if we call him this late at night
if this doesn t work then the concert and everything else is over
because president joo is a very special person to me
i m sure everything will be fine
was he talking about big sun
crap
i just told him to like her even more
i don t think i can perform at the concert without you by my side
what is it that you re trying to do by calling me out here this late at night
the number of walnuts used in here are exactly the same as the number of black keys on the piano board and the number of crust lines are the same as the number of the white keys
you have to eat this before your concerts so that you don t make any mistakes during your performance right
how did you know that
that s something that only my wife and i know about
your wife told me about it
when you tried to hurt your hand it was your wife who called for help that s how kang woo arrived in time to save you
then are you saying that my wife was watching over me
your fingers didn t get hurt and you can move them just fine can t you
do you see my wife
i i need to see her too
please help me at least talk to her
you just told me that she s here but i can t see nor feel her around me
once just once please let me see my wife just one more time
she just left so suddenly i didn t even get to say goodbye
you never did anything to hurt my hand
i m sorry
it s a relief to hear that you weren t hurt
but what made you come here and apologize to me like this
the person who relayed my wife s message to me told me to come here and make sure to apologize to you
i thought that your wife had passed away
my wife has always been by my side
i feel sure of that now
i m going to have a great concert because my wife will be by my side
a lot of times when a person dies so suddenly the people left behind have a tough time accepting the death
and i think that ruijjang is one of those people
since you baked him the pie and helped him perform at his concert there s no need for you to worry about him on top of all that either
you is it okay for you to be touching and holding just anyone like that
that man was sticking himself to you
what else was i supposed to do when he was looking at me so sadly
if i hadn t stopped you in the middle of it i bet you would ve let him cry in your arms all night
don t you ever worry about yourself
when you worry about others so much like that
- what about me
- tomorrow
i m going to be gone and out of your life for a week starting tomorrow and doesn t that even worry you
the only person in your life who can hold you and protect you will be gone and doesn t that make you nervous at all
well i don t have as many ghosts hanging around me lately as i used to
i was so frightened when i used to be surrounded by them but now that there are less of them around it s not so bad anymore
is that so
if that s the case then why did you take my favorite pen
my pen hand it over
i didn t think chief secretary kim would tell you about that
is it not in here
i must ve lost it
just take it out of my paycheck
fine tae gong shil just take the pen and get away from me
get away
ruijjang
i ve been waiting for you
i came to talk to you about my outfit for the concert
i need my wife to choose it for me
since i can t see or talk to her myself i need you to help me with it
why are you just standing there
let s go we have a ton of things to do to get ready
my wife used listen to my final rehearsal before the show she always gave me her opinion of my performance
so i need you to relay to me what she says okay
the person who relayed my wife s message asked me to come apologize to you she asked me to make sure to come and apologize to you
is tae gong shil able to see ruijjang s dead wife
that s right
and thanks to that you were able to get yourself out of a real sticky mess
i saw her talking to him
do you believe everything she tells you about what she sees
tae gong shil has a radar that no one else has and i m utilizing that for what i need
if it s hard for you to accept that then just ignore it
when you say that you use her does it mean that she helps you speak to cha hee joo
that s correct
then it s the same thing as you using tae gong shil just like the way the pianist uses her to speak to his late wife that s why you ve kept her by your side
it s not that tae gong shil herself is special you re just using her to speak to someone else that is special to you
is that correct
that s right
then i ll be leaving now
my ten billion radar
i know that my calculations are right but it really feels lousy to be compared to that pianist
i know my calculations are right
this one okay
she s telling you to dress like this
that s just my wife s style
i m not your wife
helping you get dressed in her place isn t something that i don t think i can do for you
yes i guess you re right
it would be so nice if i could be with her directly instead of having to go through you
i ll go change and be right back
your husband is a pretty difficult person
gong shil
- i brought you the cinnamon tea
will this be enough of the cinnamon scent
he likes it really strong doesn t he
what s going on here
is there someone here
it s the wife of the pianist who ll be performing his concert here today
i m doing everything that she used to do for him
i have to give it to him in that cup
hey what are you doing
he needs his wife to stay with him for him to have a successful concert
he s being so difficult i rather just tell his wife to use me to do it herself
what are you saying
you said if things go wrong they may never leave your body once they re in
that won t happen as long as i stay conscious
sorry gong ri
i shouldn t have said that and worried you
gong shil
just tell him to drink his tea and let s just go
but there s something else that i need to do for him right before the concert
here take this
- the business trip
- what
- hang on
- hey
master joo
you have to get going
okay
there s a man over there who always sits next to that trash can
give me a minute
you over there
are you friends with tae gong shil
i m going to throw this away in here
you can either tell her to get this or not
let s sit here and take a little break
why is it doing that
let s just go
he s already gone
the pill i used to take to help me fall asleep without you is going to bring you back to me
i ll soon be able to see you in this dress again
- where have you been
- i had to go see someone real quick
here drink some tea
- me
- you can drink the tea in her place right
the cinnamon scent is really strong
[ president joo ]
this woman is ready
when are you going to get here honey
you re all checked in
it s time for you to go in
check his fingers again one more time before the concert starts
his fingers are fine now
we just stopped by to see how you re feeling
everything is perfect right now
because i have her with me
who is she
bang shil
bang bang shil
- bang shil
- she s my muse who inspires me to play
we won t be able to say our goodbyes after the concert is over
we ll be leaving for france immediately following the concert
you have to help me tune up
shall we go
the blanket clad bang shil is ruijjang s muse
when did that happen
what in the world is she
isn t that tae gong shil
dressed like that she looks like a totally different person
yes she does
what is it
did you and tae gong shil break up
is that why you called me when i m leaving for my business trip
tae gong shil is with ruijjang right now
is that right
i guess she wasn t able to refuse him and ended up going to him after all
you know about it too
is tae gong shil really his muse
what
she looks and is acting like a different person
ah did you also know that she s leaving to go with him to france
she s going where
she s going to france with him
they re leaving as soon as the concert is over
i m so happy that you ve come back
we ll be able to go back to living the way we used to once we re away from here
someone may find out what s going on and may try to stop us i ll go perform the concert by myself so you go home and hide out there
i can go finish up the concert by myself so you just hurry up and go on home
rui
see you can do this without me
it s only because we re stuck in this situation right now
that s why
people can change when their circumstance changes
i m not here anymore
so it s time for you to change
but you re standing right here in front of me
i m just borrowing her for a moment so that i can do one last thing to make you come to your senses
it gave me a slight satisfaction to see you become a bumbling idiot without me
i ve lived all my life as a shadow by your side
and to see you living perfectly fine without me would ve probably pissed me off
did you leave me because i made you feel too suffocated
is that what happened
i thought that i was the reason why your heart stopped suddenly and i couldn t endure the agony of that thought
i couldn t let you go without knowing that there s another reason for why you left me
the whole time that my heart was beating i lived to serve you but now that my heart is no longer beating please just let me go
i prepared everything you ever needed in your life with my own hands
you always stood in the bright spotlight on the stage by yourself
you have to do all that by yourself now
it s not that you re especially sensitive but it s just that you re extremely lazy
you need to fix that
honey
honey
i thought master joo left for china
tae gong shil
mr joo joong won you came
are you the wife who came over to my house and made me crack all those walnuts
have you come to rescue ms tae
now that i m here it s time for you to leave now
if i just leave i can t let you in on the secret
aren t you even curious to know
curious to know how this woman views you
this is fun
are you asking me if i like that man
is it that obvious
but there s someone else whom he already likes
so i have to keep my feelings for him a secret
i can let you in on the secret
- i don t want to know
are you afraid that once you know the calculations won t add up
why do you continue to keep her by your side when the calculation doesn t add up as is
i don t want to leave her body because i m curious to know about your secrets too
take a good look and get lost
tae gong shil
are you okay
i must ve fallen asleep here kang woo
wasn t president joo joong won just here
president joo
isn t he away on his business trip
what is all this
why am i dressed up in this
don t you remember being with ruijjang
i think something must ve gone wrong
- what have i been doing
- are you sure that you re okay
let s get you home
is ms tae okay
i m not okay
you ve been working hard to keep that woman by my side haven t you
so you ve noticed
why did you do that
it s been nice to see you change
if that woman remains by my side then i m going to continue to change won t i
i don t want to change

ms tae gong shil

my joong won i mean president joo is getting married

subtitles by dramafever
[ next episode preview ]
i really can t stand men that are filthy assholes like you
are you saying that cha hee joo is still alive
i have a feeling that she s still nearby
who are you
have you called me here
i m going to lean on you
- i ll leave before you tell me to get lost
- wait get lost
do you think that you re important enough to me to get in the way of my marriage
i can t be your candy girl
- but he just ignores you
- i can t be without president joo
- doesn t it hurt
- i like him
- don t go to him
- i want to be with him
- why didn t you come to me
if the defective ghost is gone if you are tae gong sil listen carefully
since you couldn t say it directly but pretended to be a ghost as an excuse the idea that you still want me to get lost i won t believe it
i started it because you told me you can deal with it
if it becomes too difficult for you it ll be over
now what are you going to do
i think something a ghost came in and went out for a moment
thank you for helping me come back
it s a relief that you came back safely
but why did you come here
you said it was your home after i ve decided
did you forget that the date location was your house
you are much more daring than i thought
now where are you going
i said i was coming home not inviting you
when you burst into my house i don t remember inviting you either
for two people who even slept together on their first night what do you mean an invitation
so where should i sit
don t sit just go
you don t even have a seat to offer anyway
but is this your entire apartment
there really isn t any place for a ghost to hide
can i sit here
i understood everything you said i want to be safe too so just go
i didn t come in to be in danger
am i sure of myself
i m still not ready yet
you were the one who made it dangerous before
didn t you
earlier that was because i thought a ghost possessed you
well driving them away is all the same either touching with fingers toes or lips
it would ve been the same even if you had hit me
i don t even have pride to deny you or don t even have a heart to be hurt
why would i care when i m scared to death
same here
it upsets me that my heart keeps going to you and it hurts my pride because i can t control it
so i m scared to death too
but i m here
so don t drive me out
it s awkward to say this after coming in but invite me in
you even invited ghosts to your office and had coffee with them before
let me have some too
i got it
i ll give you the most bitter one one that you love the most
not even a little sweet
thanks for considering my taste
i was invited
it s crammed so get lost
she said that she doesn t even love him that much why does she keep shamelessly sticking onto joong won
people say that to the master the death of cha hee joo is a curse
tae yang says that it s a scar
i believe that tae yang can treat his wound
what is she that she can do that
to treat a wound you need to approach it but the master joong won doesn t allow anyone to approach him
if she is driven out she comes back
even if she is pulled out she just sticks to him again
not anyone can do that
you mean she caught him with all she s got
wound
to me it seems she caught his weakness
well his heart did get caught
he is calculating the best way to get to the exit
he is actually thinking about getting away from her
i think he went in hoping there will be an exit but i doubt he will find one
so you were hiding in this place before you met me
yeah
at least this was where i felt most comfortable
beer
but you can t drink
it s kang woo s not mine
why is kang woo s beer is in your fridge
cause we drink it sometimes right outside the bench it s for our convenience
if kang woo drinks the beer right outside the bench then what do you do
i can t drink alcohol so i just drink cider sprite / 7up
your fridge is already so small i don t think you have space for his beer
i do have a space for his beer
so just leave it
i put so much money into your account
move to a better place
i told you that i feel most comfortable here
kang woo s salary is quite high as well
why is he living here
he said he ll get an apartment
really
have some
where are you going
how can you leave a guest
coffee and fruits are all there so wait here
i m sure that the name had two syllables
kang woo
why is it so long
what am i doing right now
just read the last message
one toy for each sentence
i ll let the kingdom kid s mall know so show them this and pick what you want
thank you formal
but mister you re an adult
don t you know korean
i know english japanese chinese spanish
total of 5 languages
korean i have my reason so i just don t read it read that
yes
tae gong sil
i have a favor to ask of you
i heard that it will rain tonight
please take in the blanket that i left on the rooftop
don t separate the trash alone
i love you
what
oh do it with me
that surprised me
tae gong sil
you even bring kang candy s blanket in
should i just buy this whole building
so are you the ceo
why
did tae gong sil say anything about the ceo
yeah
she said he s the most special person in the world
really
you are young so you re innocent and honest
i won t think that you are flattering for just a toy
use it for anything you want
didn t you see the search engines
if you just come here like this and get caught by the reporters it won t be good
did you do this on purpose
i told you already
reporters can write about it because of the pictures from the train station
don t worry because a different article will go out tomorrow
what different article
is it going out in the celebrity info program not just a # 1 in the search engine
person who s in scandal with me might be
but don t worry
you re not coming out
what
i will have a scandal news with ceo joo joong won
with ceo joo joong won
to protect you with me i had no choice
why
are you worried about tae gong sil
how are you
me
yeah
you have nothing with him but are you okay with it
you are a celebrity
you
don t worry about me
you dumped me and now you re trying to keep me on the hook
don t look at me like that
just glare at me and get angry
what do you want me to do
i don t want to get you in trouble
whatever
it s not like this is the first time
i ll do it on my own
i know what to do
leave
call me if you need anything
didn t you leave yet
i was invited in so i should leave after being shown out by the owner of the house
bye
did you bring his blankets in well and leave the recycling that you re to do together
you read it
yeah i read it
but you can t read
i don t read
even if i don t read it with my own eyes if i want to read it i have many ways to get it done
of course
you can do anything you want
if you want to know you ll know and if you don t want to know you can ignore it
- lucky you
- but i m doing that by making deals
mr ceo
i thought of a way you can relax about their relationship
you know that story about the wolf and goat
do you know why the goat felt secure even when it was next to a wolf that could eat it
it s because the goat knew how much the wolf liked the goat
the wolf liked the goat so much that the goat knew that the wolf would never eat it but would protect it so the goat could relax
you relax too
i will protect you like the wolf
please trust me
go now
they said that it would rain
go before it starts to pour
i really don t like rainy days
what do i do
it s so scary
why haven t you left yet
you said that you re scared of water ghosts the most
if it rains and a ghost appears it s a water ghost
isn t it times like this that you need me
it is a little scarier on rainy days
but i just told you to leave really coolly
how can i ask you to stay now
you told me that you would protect me and to trust you so i ll trust you and leave later
i m ok
sleep
we re really only going to hold hands and sleep
you can t think of other things
i trust you
oh it s hot
what
sleep
lay back
since you re the only one who can drive them away she says that she can t even get rid of you and that it hurts
she s really hurt you jerk
i ll let it slide as you letting me know that she s in pain
because i have no intention of hugging her because she s hurting
using a ghost as an excuse to hug her is ok
♫ although i want to only wait to approach you quietly
♫ your distance won t become any less ♫
♫ it s okay even if i can t hug you ♫
♫ lonely love yes i love you ♫
i m upset that i m becoming more and more attached to you and it hurts my pride that i can t stop it
that s why i m also scared to death
he s so scared he can t read
i can t scare him too
tae yi ryeong double scandal
who is her other man
you should admit it s you mr ceo
you already have 4 other people on your record so it shouldn t be a big deal
tae yi ryung said it was you so it ll look better
i don t like it
your face is all over the internet anyways
it won t be much to go on and sell your face a little more
team leader kang should admit it
i don t like it either
excuse me
if you guys both refuse it ll make tae yi ryung look bad
we might be able to say she s been playing both of us and got found out
she s my kingdom model and we can t make her image look any worse
fine then
we both won t deny that it was us
good
did tae gong shil see the article
yes she came by earlier and saw the article
what did she say
she didn t seem like she cared much
where is she now
she said that there was a ghost around the entrance of the mall so she went to find it
ahjusshi please take one
please take one
please look at this
please
please look at this
please look at my child
unni
that woman must be looking for her child
that face isn t one of a living person s
how heartbroken she must be
it s so sad
her son is right next to her
please
what you can see him
her son is dead
oh thank you
that woman thinks that her child is alive and looking for him like this
eonnie should i go and tell her
how do you tell a mom that her son is dead
if she hears that she ll probably faint
don t do it
oh what to do
oh are you okay
let me help you
thank you
here please take one
if i don t tell her then she might look for her son forever
where did he go
- one minute eonnie
- hey gong shil
you re woo jin right
hello
it says that you like this snack right
come out we can talk for a minute
what is she doing
does that weird characteristics lit fourth-dimensional work on him
it s tae yi ryeong
about tae yi ryeong s scandal i know the truth
what is it
the two men don t like her
they like her
i should be careful of a scandal
anyhow i told the reporters so that you can back out of it
this i only ate with
this i only had tea with
you re grateful right
both of you don t get on my nerves because if you do i m going to get that one involved
my model contract is almost expiring so i guess i would have no business coming here
i m going to renew the contract with you
really
because i don t want people to think i ended the contract due to the scandal of just eating together
then at the fall kingdom autograph event i guess chief kang will be escorting her
since that s my job
if the contract is renewed i guess there will be many reasons to come to kingdom
secretary kim
tell vice president to negotiate down the model fee
it s okay
big sun
did you see the article about me
yes i saw it
you re fine aren t you
are you okay
i hate a salary man as well as the cursed man
are you clung onto ceo joo joong won because you want to be the fifth cursed person
you re right in that i m clung onto him but i have no intention of getting off of him so i m not going to get cursed
i guess if you don t ceo joo joong won will be the one who will
do you think a curse is a fish sauce hit-and-miss game as if you can avoid it if you want to
if it s a curse from a dead person i guess i would be able to avoid that at least
since i see dead people
right
let s go
she s still looking for him
this i need to burn it some place else
man
i have to get rid of what s in here quickly
there s a kid sitting here
but his mom thinks he s still alive so she s looking for him
but it says missing here which means he went through something very horrible
whatever i ask him he s scared and won t say anything
so now are you saying we have to comfort an invisible kid
you would feel very bewildered the first time you go through this
i ve even followed an invisible dog
what do i need to do
i heard you re scared of this stuff
if you can t handle it you may leave
i decided not to avoid scary things
and i feel really bad for both the kid and his mom
miss tae gong shil
what do i need to do
thank you mr kang woo
it says here that he likes to sing children s songs
should i sing a song
he s wearing a t-shirt with the picture of a teddy bear
i guess he likes a teddy bear very much
then three bears will be good
i will sing the song
no you would feel shy singing it alone so how about we take a turn with each phrase
you said the kid s name is woo jin right
woo jin
these ahjussis will sing a song so listen well okay
chief kang
cue
there are three bears in one house
daddy bear mommy bear baby bear
daddy bear is fat
mommy bear is thin
baby bear is so cute
shrug shrug you re doing so good
he s smiling
do it again
there are three bears in one house
daddy bear mommy bear baby bear
daddy bear is fat
mommy bear is thin
baby bear is so cute
shrug shrug you re doing so good
shru
shrug shrug you re doing so good
shrug
that s enough
at the very moment miss tae gong shil had an accident she was having the time of her life
but at the age of 24 she had a sudden unknown accident and after being hospitalized for 3 years at the age of 27 she suddenly got up and after maintaining the life of a loser she joined kingdom a while ago
so what was that accident
that i haven t found out yet
you last night you went to the grilled heart restaurant with tae gong shil s sister and even brought the receipts
what did you ask her while eating there
that s why i arranged a meeting with her at a pork feet restaurant
i will definitely find out what kind of accident tae gong shil was involved in
are you going around famous restaurants
i m sorry i m just a little obsessed with food
the grill hearts were good last night
today i ll buy you a pork feet dinner
no
but yesterday we were talking about your sister s accident and you fell unconscious after drinking a lot of soju so we didn t get to talk about the rest too much
it was getting really interesting
you re right
i did have quite a few drinks while talking about it
i m sorry
i m not going to talk about such a depressing story any more
i m okay- -
- i ll see you at the port feet restaurant
i missed a change to talk about the important stuff while talking about what happened in the military
but how come she listens to the story of playing soccer in the military boring story so well that i can t stop talking about it
she ll come to the pork feet restaurant thinking i ll tell her funny stories but why does my foot so numb guilty
did the accident happen here
how come no one saw you die
did he hide it
how could not see
how strange
miss
are you looking for something
no well
has there been an accident around here by any chance
no not really
no
how strange
that are you looking for that kid
yes
thank you
huh
did she see something
no there was no one
she didn t recognize me either
please take a look
ahjussi please look at it
that s my baby please
unni please have a look
that s my baby
ahjussi
please take a look at this
unni this
please take a look
excuse me
please look at this
it s my baby
please
please have a look
this kid is dead but the mom
but should i tell her
if she s not aware she s going to live in pain but she knows she ll want to die with him
she ll have to live suffering for the rest of her life with her dead baby next to her
i feel so sad for her
the kid s mom doesn t see the dead boy
if you tell her that you see the dead boy you ll become a really horrible person to her
if you find out where he is don t do anything on your own and just call the police
i should do that right
were you also like that the first time
when i told you i saw dead cha hee joo was i horrible to you
i hated that she stayed near me for such a long time
are you saying you re seeing joong won to treat him
there s nothing you can do
joong won is doing very well
he can t read yet
you really got his weakness
fine
what is it that you can do
can you call up dead hee-joo
if i call her up then will his wounds heal
bang-shil if i say it nicely you can t understand me
i ll put it simply leave joong-won alone
he buried the past well and he s been fine
also because the statute of limitations is expiring soon you should forget it
you sticking with him and making him think about hee-joo is worse off
leave him alone
auntie if i bring up hee joo is it really so terrifying
now you re understanding me
yes it s terrifying so leave him alone
why are there so many words
ah i m thirsty
did she drink beer with chief kang today too
why are you here
to entrust you with my beer
why are you leaving your beer here
there is no room for my beer in my fridge
does that even make sense
your fridge is as big as my house
why doesn t it have room
there s none
do you want to go see
pack your cider and you can come to my house
forget it
my small fridge has no room for your beer
take it back
if you make room then there s room
look it fits so well in here
hmm there s one less beer
did he drink one within that timespan
how did you know
we just drank earlier
kang-woo s police friend said he ll check up on the place i went earlier today and drank a beer
why did you tell that to kang woo not to me
you said it was terrifying
it s totally understandable
i ll take care of it
you don t have to take care of hee-joo problem
you said you saw hee-joo through me
did hee joo say something to you that last time
something very shocking
you didn t get tricked joong-won
it would be nice if you could go back to the way you were before
i love you
yes she said something very shocking
i didn t get tricked and to come back to my past self and that she loves me
if she said that don t you think something is wrong
kang-woo said he found something strange about hee-joo
did you perhaps ask him what it was
i didn t want to know it so i left it alone
it s that scary
yes
then do you want to handle it
now that i think about it if you want to stay next to me it might be one of the biggest things you need to handle
when we re alone together and hee-joo appears then you ll see her
if you see a ghost that loves me you might feel very dirty
even if you see her don t let me know
touch me inconspicuously and she ll disappear and you ll feel even worse about chasing her away
even then it d be better than being all three of us together
can you handle it
you can t right
if you cant handle it then don t bother me
i can handle it
that s what i m best at
don t leave it alone and find out what it is
you couldn t even read for 15 years
don t you think you need to at least read now
it s embarrassing running away from your fears
let go i m going
it s embarrassing let me go
♫ why do you keep running away from me
♫ why do you keep getting further away from me
♫ stay by my side ♫
it s embarrassing that i haven t read a single book
since i started you i m gonna finish you
how long does the wolf hold on and how arrogant the sheep is
♫ you make me cry ♫
♫ you re almost close enough for me to catch you ♫
♫ but when i reach for you you move farther away like the wind ♫
♫ love which leaves you alone ♫
♫ love only leaves me in tears ♫
♫ that worthless that foolish love ♫
the ceo hasn t asked me about cha hee-joo yet
yes i ll be waiting
team leader
did you see the article about tae yi ryeong being hospitalized
i saw it it must be her time to get sick
so coldhearted
he s a chic dooly
is she really sick
kang woo
aren t you a bit much
about what
i know you saw the article
can t you at least come with soju and dried squid to visit
literal isn t that what you call taking care of your aquarium
just with soju and squid do you think i m a fish that can be contained in a salaryman s aquarium
i m a whale that even the pacific ocean knows about
you re right you can be a whale
thanks to you my friend that works in china contacted me saying he saw me on the newspaper
your aquarium isn t big enough to raise a whale right
yes
i can t handle a whale
how about a dolphin
even if you stoop to an anchovy s level i don t want to raise you in my aquarium
who said i ll stoop to an anchovy s level for you
are you crazy
♫ i m visualizing you ♫
♫ these moments right here ♫
♫ what do they mean to you for me and to me for you
♫ i will become ♫
♫ a comfort without sadness for you ♫
♫ remember i will always be here ♫
♫ it s so strange living life ♫
♫ it s like an unsolvable puzzle ♫
chief kang
joong won wants a report on hee joo
my father said to hear the explanation from you so explain it to me
you called me up so fast
these are the last instructions that my father has given you
are you going to leave now
i m not leaving
you re guarding a shopping mall to the end with more than enough ability to even guard the blue house
i heard you have an apartment
what s the reason for staying at the dorm
until you resolve the cha hee-joo problem and tae gong shil becomes useless to you i ll wait until then
what s inside here
explain it to me
your father coincidentally found this in europe this picture
cha hee-joo
he thinks cha hee-joo is alive and he thinks she s somewhere near by you
hee joo is dead
who is this girl that looks exactly like her
the girl in the picture is supposedly agatha christy s passionate fan
even on the card that she sent her pen-name is the fictional character wargrave
wargrave
it s an unforgettable name
he was invited to this place by some sort of maniac
and there was no one there
he might be this awful murderer
it was the name of the criminal from the novel i last read
hee-joo was an orphan
was there a twin sister
and is that the accomplice she wants to protect
hee joo
hee joo
get out
hee joo
let me go
who s the one that died
i m sorry joo joong won
the person you want to protect i need to find her
joo joong won you came here to meet cha hee joo
i m thankful
i need to know where you are so i can tell your mom
is that missing child still there
yes
he won t talk
after being dragged into your world i listened to what you saw and heard but actually i can t see or hear anything
i m just listening to you and looking at you
after only looking at you i guess i m completely spellbound
you re right
it s all my fault
yes it s all your fault
also knowing everything about hee joo is also all your fault
tae gong shil i just came back from visiting hee joo
good job
these days i m even looking at books
you can read words
i can t read i m not improving
but i m still looking at it

oh there they are
that woman is the one who will be marrying ceo joo
nice to see you miss seo yeon
nice to see you
nice to see you too
let s head on upstairs
is that woman an employee here
she keeps looking at us
stop looking at her and go quickly
i can t stand it
you go ahead
have you been doing well for the past week
you don t look too bad
for me it was hell
mr ceo are you really getting married
aren t you curious
don t you want to know how she feels about you
what secret
i can see right through her
can you see something
something that is just as scary as the ghosts you see
ceo are you trying to avoid me are you getting married so that you don t have to see me again
tae gong shil do you think that you mean something to me enough that it ll affect my wedding
no
then you don t have the right to ask me why
and i don t have an obligation to give you an answer right
yes
episode 10
your aunt already went upstairs
let s go
as i ve told you already i hate people touching my body
even if you re about to trip and fall try to avoid touching me
our master is so cold and rude even to his fiancé
if he s not even going to let her touch him why is he getting married
i wish he had given me a head s up
how could he even not answer my phone call
tae gong shil
kang woo
did you not know about ceo joo joong won s wedding
yes
i m a little surprised the news of it was so sudden
the night of louis jang s concert
ceo joo came here instead of going on his business trip right
when you two met that night did something happen
did he come that night
then the person i saw that night was mr ceo
i guess i was right
he did come here to see you
that night i was almost out of my mind
i really wasn t myself
i think the ghost wife met mr ceo when she was still inside my body
what did they talk about
what secret
i can see right through her
she must have told him my secret
secret
i think she told him that i like mr ceo
oh no
even though you need her for your business is it really okay to use marriage to get what you want
it s okay
i ve used my brains to calculate the risks and i ve come up with a good answer
tae yang seemed very surprised and a little thrown off by the news
what are you going to do
the reason why i can t figure out an answer when it comes to her is because instead of being in my head she was inside somewhere else
i was surprised like hell to realize this but i ve come to accept it
if so you need to tell that person how you feel
also tell her that you re not really getting married
i don t want to do that
secretary kim the reason why i still don t - the reason why i can t read
i want to live using my head which works just fine
since tae yang is a person who can see ghosts and souls don t you think she ll be able to see your issues and embrace them
then when i die i ll become a ghost and i ll go visit her when that happens
i think he s trying to get rid of me
but i can t live without him
tae gong shil your hideout is he the only one
does it have to be him
he s my one and only hideout in this world
i just got his permission to stay by his side after begging like crazy
saying he s getting married and keeping a woman by his side that means he s telling you not to stay by his side as a woman
now that he s getting married if he knew that i liked him he would ask me to get lost right
you said you liked him being ignored like this doesn t it hurt
in your world i m candy and mr ceo is prince charming on a white horse right
but in my world i m just a ghost radar and mr ceo is a shelter where i can hide
i can t be candy
because he has no intention of being prince charming
but i can still be useful as a radar so i think he ll let me stay by his side
i think i should go see him
mr ceo congratulations on your engagement
what
earlier i was too surprised and i couldn t tell you something important
congratulations on your engagement and i wish you happiness
you re being scary why are you saying this
mr ceo since you re about to become someone s sweet home you may be uncomfortable with having a shelter but instead of getting rid of it how about leaving it underground at about the 2nd level below ground
if you do that i ll use it lightly from time to time without making you feel uncomfortable
sweet home
i don t like sweet stuff
if not please give birth to a son
give birth to a son who has the same powers as you and if you let me take care of him
you come in here out of the blue and you re going too far with this telling me to give birth to a son
tae gong shil are you acting like this because of the secret you told the nutcracker ghost
did that wife tell you my secret
no i didn t hear about it
if it was a secret it means you wanted to hide it from me so i didn t dig further i politely refused saying that i wouldn t hear about it
you re thankful right
is that what you did
but it really wasn t anything
i didn t hear about it but seeing how you act it s so obvious
you re being so awkward that i m beginning to suspect whether you even have the will to keep it a secret
bursting in here saying congratulations i wish you happiness
what you re doing is exactly what that famous girl one who says i won t cry even when lonely or sad
you re following her pattern
you re being just like her candy
never mind
this may actually make it easier
making the effort to congratulate me telling me that you ll move into the basement of my sweet home and since you re also saying you ll be my son s little hideout nanny so that you won t be embarrassed i ll act as if i didn t see or hear anything
you re good
it seems like you re misunderstanding something but that person i said i liked to that wife isn t you it s someone else
you know who it is
i like very sweet things
also all this time i stayed next to you despite all the bad things you said because you were my hideout
as a woman i hate men like you
men who are mean and rude
fine
i m grateful that i m not your type
then i ll leave before you tell me to get lost
those words they made me feel terrible
wait
get lost
if you were going to make an excuse you should have made up a different one
out of all things why did it have to be candy kang
tae gong shil the vp s wife is looking for you
for louis jang to introduce you to us as his muse i guess you must have an eye for art
i asked you to come so you can take a look at this
open it and take it out
this one
it s a vase
this is an engagement present for joong won sent by her family
it might be a little crass to speak of money but it s extremely expens
ahh
do you know how expensive this is
i m sorry
i was surprised
i guess you d be surprised
i guess this item is too much for you to handle am i correct
what if you d broken it
even the thought is scary isn t it
you re probably thinking i shouldn t have touched it
yes
that kind of stuff don t touch them they re bad
what
- tae gong sil
calling something like this stuff is a little
it s a very valuable white porcelain
it s because people now keep saying it s so valuable but really it was probably just once a water container
please don t keep saying this is too valuable for just anyone to handle it will turn rude and arrogant
what
are you saying that to me
well i m just speaking about the vase
that s right
by analogy to this vase don t try to touch our joong won and break off the marriage i m saying this nicely to you but what
rude and arrogant
i m sorry
i was just talking about this vase
this was originally just a water container
but the person looking at it can keep putting their heart in and weird things can come out
once you are bewitched in the wrong way the only recourse would be to break it
are you not understanding because i m saying it nicely
are you saying that you re going to do whatever it takes to sabotage joo won s marriage
you re really dangerous
i think you don t understand because you can t see it i even went and congratulated him on the engagement
if you mishandle this vase it could be extremely dangerous so please be careful
that really should be destroyed
someone will get bewitched
bang shil fighting
scary things will come around
bewitched
bang shil s talking about herself isn t she
you got dragged into the vice president s office
it was a little scary
what did she throw an envelope full of money at you
no
i saw a ghost
i warned them but they couldn t comprehend what i said
is that so
you
people keep misunderstanding and say that you were rejected by the ceo
i guess my advances are seen as being candy to other people
at times like this only ghosts understand my story
the marriage has been announced now
you ll get rid of her right
i have no intention of that
i brought up marriage so that i can safely keep her
you re going to let her stay by your side
is she refusing to leave
i m not letting her go
because i can t not see her for now i m securing a safe distance with the marriage and i m going to keep seeing her
until when
until i don t want to see her anymore
was she scared because of this
we told her it was extremely expensive and she almost broke it in surprise
she wouldn t have been surprised that it was expensive
is something attached to it
joong won
do you know how much this is
because boasting about money won t scare her in the future don t do that
he really
ceo joo fighting
big tae yang is dating the ceo of kingdom
as if
ceo joo is marrying the daughter of seo jin group
really
mi kyung who works at kingdom hotel says she saw them doing an event together
he s just playing her a bit
frankly even playing around their statuses are very incompatible
why
what s wrong with big tae yang
she s smart pretty good at sports and has a good personality
honestly was she the big tae yang for no reason
i thought that kingdom s ceo was someone who fits well with big tae yang
you have to see her to come to your senses
do you want to meet her
let s pick a date
you re going to be surprised
are you alright
what did you see in the porcelain
isn t it that something scary followed you
it didn t follow me
but it s something dangerous so please warn them to be careful
they didn t seem to understand me
why didn t you come to me
if you came to me because you needed me i said i wouldn t avoid you
after telling me to leave the safety hideout as it is in the 2nd level basement in the sweet home why didn t you use it
can i be honest
if you can go ahead
i was afraid the person i like would misunderstand
are you going to keep insisting that that person is candy kang
are you going to keep misunderstanding it to be you
misunderstanding
in a manwha movie i saw before struck by lightning i was a wolf who met a sheep
in order for the wolf to live it must eat the goat but because she loved the sheep she couldn t eat and almost starved to death
in order to survive he should see it as something to eat she s not supposed to look at the sheep as someone she loves so he s kind of stupid right
i won t do that type of thing
so you re saying that your wolf thinks of this sheep as a food source
yes
that s why you shouldn t keep asking if the wolf likes the goat
alright then
let s say the wolf was like that what about the goat
in the movie the goat also likes the wolf
then what happens
the goat likes the wolf so much that it says
wolf just eat me
that goat must be crazy
when the wolf likes the goat ♫ when my fingertip brushes you ♫
but would the wolf eat the goat only because of that
♫ the warmth spreads to my icy heart ♫
♫ i can t even touch you ♫
don t you want to know her secret
i don t want to know
why
are you afraid you can t make calculations if you know
♫ lonely love yes i love you ♫
yes
should i have listened so i can know for sure
ah i don t know
don t know
the elder said that if his son is really getting married he will adjust his schedule and return earlier
about this wedding what am i supposed to report
to tell you the truth this wedding is fake
it s business for both sides
if i accept your proposal does the owner of sejin group change
i didn t come here for a study but on an exile
once i return to korea with the marriage as an excuse avoiding my step-mother s control i m going to find my bed-ridden father s bank account under a different name
i will turn sejin holding company into sejin cement corporation
the excuse of marriage will a week be enough
if you help me i will help you expand kingdom s business in shanghai by providing you with sejin s support i will give you the wings so that you can fly
that proposal i will accept it
after one week the wedding could become something that never happened
tell the chairman that he doesn t need to try too hard to change his schedule
does tae gong shil know the truth
she doesn t
to her before ceo joong won explains it don t mention it first
i understand
i prefer a simple white porcelain vase to a flashy celadon green-glazed vase
it s just like a dignified scholar
don t just touch it recklessly
she said it s not good to touch it
just look at it
that s a ridiculous story
honey what do you think you are doing
i mean what about it
no one s around anyway
what about me
i told you that i hate undignified people
go scratch in the bathroom
i get it
how did i fall for a man like that
when he wasn t even my type
i liked men who were like dignified scholars
who are you
a gentle virtuous scholar like you is calling on me
when are you going to fix this annoying sleeping habit
i ve always been doing this but why are you suddenly saying that now
before
you told me it was cute that i sleep like a little kid
not being decent
go sleep in another room
i was meeting a noble scholar in my dream why that kick
who did you meet
i m going to the vp s office now
let s go together
no i think it s best for you to not come with me
is there a ghost
i saw something there
that s why i wanted to go to check on it
so if you just give me the keys i ll just go by myself
let s go together
if i don t check it well i won t be able to pass by the vice president s office anymore
i ll bring the keys
let s go
are you going to stay here
due to the business trip there s a lot of work piled up
secretary kim you finished all your work so you can go
yes
taeyang is still here but should we go out together
no
i guess kang woo will probably take her
he s saying it so i could hear him but i didn t hear anything
what is this
did she already leave
kang woo
you can hold me if you re scared
ok then i ll lean on you
i don t want to hold on like a kid
i am used to this posture
ok
but please loosen your grip
alright i will
where should we look
the vase isn t here
no ghosts either
they aren t there
tae gong shil you aren t scared
i m scared too
i m just more used to it than you
were you living in hiding for so long because you were scared
i was just living in hiding but after i met mr ceo it got a lot better
my life started becoming different since i found a breathing space
the ceo is giving you something that i could never give
but he s getting married now
i don t think i can keep staying by his side
after a week this could be something that never happened
miss tae gong shil why don t you test yourself to see if you really need him or not
even when he wasn t here you came to work and endured it well
but i don t know if i ll be able to not stick to him when he s right next to me
give yourself about a week and please think about it well
if you decide that you are fine without him even if the situation changes
don t go back to him
it will hurt
wait for me and we ll go together
i heard there s a nice ramyun shop near our building
there s something there though
then you direct me to a place without them
the kimbap place next to it has nothing
but it also has no taste
the kimbap place sounds better
hold it
is kang woo not here
the chief is out somewhere
we see you a lot
since i see you often do i also look like a neighborhood girl to you
no you re a goddess of course
appearing in our security office a goddess
what is that
it s the chief s
it s cute
i m sorry but a picture
if you keep doing this you won t be able to go
what is this
kang woo
you re so cute
did you just do this because you were scared
do it again
that s enough
why are you here again
there might be an article about you and me
we got our photos taken in the subway
i m meeting with a close reporter tomorrow if you come with me and have some beer you can become a bodyguard
and if i feel like it you ll come out as my boyfriend
that article will become number one
i m going to the kimbap place with tae gong shil later
you should come along and eat korean yellow radish next to her since you re friends
kang woo
it got on well
let s go
let s show gong shil too
this color and this color are the same
is that right
let s go next time to eat kimbap
yes i understand
i ll go first then
mr ceo didn t leave yet
he s not here
oh my god
i thought you were a ghost
it would be better if i was a ghost without having to be worried about anyone else and being concerned for only yourself
if you were a ghost you would have to hold on to me instead of me holding on to you
i m really popular among the ghosts
when they see me i actually seem like the sun
i m not even a ghost but why am i like this
what
come in
sit
tae gong shil do you just want to be candy
come out of hostage i ll get you a house
you might need a car choose one
do you want to study more
then do it
i ll let you
is there a big ghost that you need to find
tae gong shil normally people say either thank you or why are you being like this
i don t need a big house because then there s a lot of room for ghosts to hide
and for the car i do have my license but i m scared that something might come out so i don t need it
and i m thinking about studying but i think i ll be able to take a test even when there are ghosts
you re giving me answers that i can t calculate at all
the relationship that you and i have
i want to set things straight
with no money and being frugal you push away and stick to a man with a lot of money and people around you are telling you that it won t work out
if i buy you a house or a car you either act cute or get upset do it the easy way
you who talk about ghosts in a porcelain vase when my aunt is trying to embarrass and insult you you re hard to understand
just be simple and be candy
then i for sure can get rid of you
if you re curious about the end i m not scared
then you re saying that you can easily push me away
if i go into your world and become your one and only person if that happens i can t tell you to get lost
so to make it easier for me to deal with you be candy and with me let s play in here
if i become candy then that means i ll have to leave when you tell me to get lost
i don t want to do it
then what do you want me to do
i tell you i m getting married and you tell me to make a shelter for you at the b2 floor
i tell you to be candy but you say you don t want to accept gifts and leave in return
you want me to become a sheep and expect me to say hunt me and eat me
i don t expect anything like that
why is it so hard for you
is it a burden that i might like you
i don t like you
just like how we caught the water ghost at the hotel i ll just go catch the porcelain ghost
there are none here
go home
let s go
look at this
after hearing all that you don t say why are you doing this or what do you think you re doing
truthfully on the way here i saw a very scary ajumma
let s go
where did you see her
at the entrance i think it s her first time here
i guess i have to keep holding you hand
if you re uncomfortable it s okay if we just hold fingers
while i was on my business trip did you see any other scary things
there was
but i endured by holding onto your ballpoint pen
pen
oh as an amulet
mr ceo i ve been thinking since i was kind of okay spending a week away from you with just that pen so when the time comes before you tell me to get lost
so don t worry too much
there will be an end
necklace
i don t think she picked it up
am i really that burdensome
everyone pay attention
after china it is america
i ll give you three minutes of time
those of you who can t keep pace go work for giant mall
secretary kim
keep an eye on giant mall s construction plan
make all of it into mirrors make it pretty everyone got it
i heard that girl and the ceo together slept in a suite room
a suite room
they even borrowed the whole swimming pool
who
over there
but i heard she got dumped
because he s marrying someone else
of course
i knew it would happen
i knew it was going to be like this
but i m still kind of jealous
what are you jealous of
are they talking about me
even i would marry someone else
seonbeenim scholar how can you have such good thoughts and be so graceful
this is good
try it
how vulgar and repulsive
why are you being like this again
you called me dirty earlier for going to the bathroom
why you keep hating everything i do
a man be such a flake
i lost my appetite
i knew dooly i guess there was a gong shil too
you seem tired these days so for gong shil to have strength take gong shil
thank you
she kind of looks like dooly
gong shil s boyfriend is dooly
really
please take care of gong shil
okay i ll reserve the restaurant
i ll see you later
is this your office
it s so tiny
i heard all our classmates from high school are having a gathering
everyone s wondering about you
can t you feel it
i ll go
i think i need to go to places like that
really
when we decide the place and time i ll let you know
i m asking this because i m really curious what s your relationship with ceo joo joong won
just look at it as you see it
i heard that you got rejected
if it looked like that i guess it is
that s too bad
ceo joo joong won has been known for that first love curse
the wedding was broken several times but i think this time he will actually marry
too bad the curse got broken just about the same time you tried to win him over
i know right
what s that
gong shil her name is gong shil too
is this dooly s copycat
no her boyfriend is dooly
yes i will go to the airport on time
okay
i ll see you then
if i go in this time i think i might be there for a long while
are you going to find this woman
if she s alive i need to find her
joo woong the saying that he s under cha hee joo s curse that rumor spread every time wedding was mentioned
this time how it s going to be there will be a lot of talk going around
to the ceo cha hee joo isn t a curse but a pain
if it s a pain he supposed to look for someone to cure it
maybe it is a real curse
he kicks everyone out not letting anyone near
that s right
and he always goes get lost
a person who says he will not change and a person who will not go away no matter how much you kick them away
if they come together who do you think will win
are you talking about ceo and me
i m on your side
i heard tomorrow you re going to a class meeting
where s the location
tomorrow the meeting with sejin group park sung ji has been planned
it s been almost a week but are you sure you want to cancel it
are you not planning to continue
i know everything about what secretary kim is thinking
i m not going to tell you
honey
why is this person doing this to me lately
we have to break that though
since this is president joo s fiance s gift leave this here
is aunt really wierd
after bringing this she completely ignores me and when i tell her to do something she says that she s tired and can t do it
she even told me that she doesn t want to see my face
she s not the type of person to do that though
according to that miss if something happens we should break this but even though things are weird this isn t something that should be broken just from listening to those words
tae gong sil said to break this
yes she did
but still
president joo you take responsibility for this
after breaking this i should say to take responsibility
you said to break this
do i really have to
is your aunt not feeling well
she s in a really bad state
she s in a critical state and can t even get up
then do i break this or not
then you re supposed to break it
if this breaks you know that the wedding gets cancelled too right
do i break it or not
you can t really break those things though
they said aunt is in a very bad state that she s almost dying
she s the only aunt i have though
then you have to break it
then it s decided
we re trusting your words and breaking this
if the wedding breaks too then you take responsibility
why do i have to take responsibility for that
because of you she s dying so we break it
no
honey
honey
what
what
what s wrong
are you okay
are you okay
what was that
what was that
i don t see anything
gong sil you said to break it for the ghost but why was the reason changed to breaking the wedding
for you it wasn t like that right
to others how they might see you next to him i think i understand now
what do i do
kang woo ssi
is there something there
it was gong sil to gong sil talking
it s been almost a week
how do you feel
even though that person isn t here do you think you ll be okay
i m not sure if it s okay for him to be gone but i now understand what it s like to be next to him
gong sil when both are together does it match well
you said that you had a gathering today right
sumo said that you were very nervous
that s right
it s been a really long time since i met my friends
when girls meet together they brag a lot about their boyfriends right
i guess so
then tae gong sil you should also brag about your man
who
dooly
at that spot if dooly shows up all girls faint
but rather than dooly i think liked dochi more
that won t do then
if you want to talk about dooly then he should be there too
you re going to the airport to escort the president right
yes
then do you have an appointment
oh with tae yang
yes
lee hyun joo has a loud mouth so you should tell her that gong sil and the president aren t in that type of relationship
who makes those rumors anyway
i agree
i don t understand why people go around saying whatever they want nowadays
listening to some people it seems like it was someone from the security team
really
but does our security team have someone with that kind of cheap mouth
you should figure it out so i can give them my wrath
when you figure it out i won t ask for money for coffee
eat this
lee hyun joo is right here
after lunch finishes he said to come to the vice president s room
why would the vice president look for you
i wonder too
i wonder why
then go and found out who has the cheap mouth
then i ll be going
this is takeout
honey
what again
it sounds so powerful how you suck those noodles right in
i fell for those sexy lips
you must have gone crazy
according to that miss breaking that vase must really have had an effect
but why did joong won break that fiance s really important gift
i wonder
maybe he was thinking of breaking up the wedding
honey
you said that hyungnim is coming in today right
it s been a year already
he couldn t be coming to help joong won s wedding
maybe there s some other issue
kang woo it s been a long time
let s go
thanks to you the problem s been solved
if kingdom s side doesn t mind i want to continue this marriage
it s unfortunate that we must stop here
it s nothing to be unfortunate about
it started out as a business deal and we ve gained a lot
we should both calculate how big that is
yes it s been a long time
i come by a lot
oh big tae yang
wow it s been a really long time
hi
come here
are you okay
what s wrong
no
no it s nothing
i m okay
anyway since we cancelled the wedding i can t say let s see each other often
if it s like this then have i become president joo s cursed love
it s famous
kingdom s joo president is stuck on a cursed dead first love
it s been your fourth breakup wedding cancelled right
i hope you get free from your curse next time
that girl said that she was the fourth curse
if we gather all the cursed women and play go stop we could sell kwangdo
even though we gather them it won t be fun they all are pushed out by a dead girl
a heart that no one accepts is cursed
if it doesn t change then it won t be freed either
the reason why i kept you close to joong won is because of this piece of photograph
this is maria
i accidentally found this picture in maria s old photo album
who do you think this other woman is
that s cha hee joo
where is this place
england
yes
a woman who doesn t just resemble but looks exactly the same was in england
one year after cha hee joo died
then are you saying cha hee joo is alive
you said joong won met the dead cha hee joo through the woman named tae gong shil right
i found the living cha hee joo in europe
then could cha hee joo have been one of the twins
that s the most possible scenario
but i found something very strange
what are these
those are the x-mas cards which the english person who took this picture exchanged these x-mas cards for 10 years
she lived traveling many different places overseas
looking at the sent date sequence she lived 3 years in la 4 years in new york and 3 years in peking
my son stayed abroad after the kidnapping incident
3 years in la 4 years in new york 3 years in peking
did this woman follow around ceo joo joong won
the last postcard had a message that she s returning to korea
that was 5 years ago and after that joong won came back to korea and he s been living here since
do you think this woman is somewhere near ceo joo joong won
yes
i believe that cha hee joo is alive and she followed joong won after that incident and she s still some place very close
who is she
i haven t seen her around
she moved here not too long ago
it s tae gong shil
ah
she said she was going to a school reunion
i guess it was here
i heard your father just checked in the hotel
chief kang woo will be here soon
will you see him and listen to what he says
i will talk to my father in person
you don t need to call chief kang woo
i didn t call him
rather he s coming here to see tae yang
i guess he s going to join them
wow
tae yang will be pretty proud in front of her high school friends today
her boyfriend is so tall and good looking
so you had an accident
how about now are you okay
yes
i ve gotten much better
but it s such a waste that you didn t get to graduate from that college that school background
until what age can you go back to your study
there s still time but
gong shil
tell me about you
you said you re working at kingdom right
you
the ceo there is he really your boyfriend
tell them in detail what you told me
how you made advances to him and how you got rejected
you re right
i met a man who s really rich and successful
how
on a heavy raining day i got a ride in a very nice car
but the person was kingdom s ceo
i really wanted to see him again so i went to visit him
i felt like i had to hold on to him so i got a part-time job there and followed him around
when i told him i was alone and sad he started looking at me
the safety hideout came
hide
whenever i was going through a hard time he helped me and stayed with me
ah he even held an event for me by renting the whole hotel pool
how do you see me after hearing my story
hey we re so jealous
i envy you
and then what
you know the ending is what s important
that person is marrying a chaebol s daughter soon
no wonder
still i haven t gotten off of him and i still hold on to him tightly
because i can never be separated from him
that s a little
i can t help it ever though i look shameless and pathetic
because to me he s the only one special person in the world
that s me
tae gong shil
i came here after breaking off the marriage because of you
so you take the responsibility
let s go
what are you doing here
now you re doing what i wanted to see from you
then is it my turn to act all charming
my kid is pretty upset
to appease her i ll treat you to this dinner
please have a fun and enjoyable time here
my baby will you come with oppa
let s go
what the heck do they think they re doing
without the talks of radar and the safety hideout people understand the relationship between you and me easily
stop it
i get it now
this is me in your world
tae gong shil
what s wrong
what s wrong
did something happen
i was taking her with me
kang woo
what s the matter
why is tae gong shil acting that way
why did ceo joo come here
he said that he broke off the marriage because of her
and told her to take the responsibility
what about you
why are you here
did you come here because of her too
yes
do you really like tae gong shil
yes
with this you won t ever tell me to become your boyfriend again right
you said you would make the whole thing available and to use everything
i just need a small space to breathe in
but are you that afraid that i would want something else
yes i am
can you really protect me without other thoughts
after protecting me while looking at me strictly as a marble safety hideout once you think you can live again can you get lost on your own
i told you i would
i m like that even now
can i trust that
even though you just stomped me so horribly if a scary thing suddenly pops out i can immediately run straight into your arms
i m like that
it s not like you don t know that
fine i ll trust you
from now on i m going to do whatever i want to do to make myself at ease
from now on you handle everything
thank you
i can handle everything
is that right
then start with handling this
tae yang
i think i love you
what will you do now
ms tae i think that i m in love with you
what are you going to do about it
first you were planning to get married then you wanted me to be your candy girl and now you re saying that you love me are you teasing me right now
i broke off an expensive engagement
then i put on a goosebumps inducing cute act just to get you out of there but all you think this is me teasing you
why are you being like this
you re frightening me
when you first ran over to me because you saw a ghost i thought that you were joking and i was scared too at the same time
i understand what you re feeling right now
but i ve now accepted it
so you need to accept it too
if i accept it will it change anything
you don t seem to be getting this at all so let me give you an example
from now on if you ask me to hold your hand and sleep with you i will enjoy it with open arms
are you acting like this on purpose so that i won t touch you anymore
the reason why i keep touching you doesn t have anything at all to do with enjoyment
you know that i have no choice but to touch you out of necessity
i know that you have your definite reasons but i no longer have a reason
i kept wondering why i let you stick around even when things didn t add up but it was because i like you
i tried putting up a wall between us by setting up that engagement so that i don t wield you around like i really want to
i even tried to calculate you out and turn you into my candy girl but you told me you didn t want that
i did everything that i could think of now i m just going to do whatever i want
remaining unyielding and staying strong is your responsibility from now on
you take care of it
i just don t understand this
if you like me then shouldn t you be telling me to fall for you
does this look like i m making a sweet confession of love to you
i m giving you a flat out warning not to fall for me no matter how i try to seduce you
if you don t want me to fall for you then you shouldn t be seducing me hang on a second
i m having a serious conversation right now
come back later
so you re telling me right now that you like me but i shouldn t like you
just a minute
i m trying to have a serious conversation over here what
i don t have time to do that right now
i missed you the whole time i was gone i was worried too
i felt pathetic for checking my phone all the time in case you called so i turned my phone off instead and didn t take any phone calls
what am i to do when you re doing this to me
this is the type of stuff that i m telling you to handle
i have faith in you
i feel so much better now that i ve gotten all that off my chest
let s go
tae gong shil said president joo joong won is a very special person to her unlike anyone else in this world
that s what she said
president joo broke off his engagement and came to get her
there s no room for you there i guess you re right
now that you know you can t continue to have feelings for her anymore
that s something for me to handle
but now that you know you shouldn t follow me around anymore
i didn t pay much attention because i thought you were hanging about out of boredom but if you re serious then stop
i m not being serious
i don t even do serious documentaries or dramas i usually stick to lighter stuff
following you around was like filming the variety show running man
i m not stopping because you told me to stop
that s a relief
didn t you say that your friends were inside you should get back in there
even yoo jae suk thanked me for appearing on his show and asked me to return so who is he to tell me to stop
do you think that you became attracted to me because of the physical contact
i wouldn t be coming after you just because i m a little attracted
in any case
i guess i did fall for some sort of desire you stirred up in me
then are we on a date right now since we are walking hand in hand like this
is there anywhere that you d like to go
there are a lot of places that i d want to go but it s already dark out so it s a little scary but as long as i hold onto your hand i guess we can go anywhere
that s the kind of man i am to you
if i walk around holding your hand like this then i can go into night markets or the movie theater and i can even go and see the night skyline
i remember going to see the night skyline in the past there was a lot ghosts floating outside the window that followed me there so i had to leave without seeing any of the scenery
if you like being up high then should we fly up in my plane so that you could fly into the sky
will you come with me to anywhere i want to go
i ll stay with you right by your side for the night since i ll be the one enjoying it
hang on then where should we go
should we go to namdaemun no how about dongdaemun
should we go to the seashore
i don t know what to do
hang on a second
yes chief secretary kim yes
yes i understand
- president joo i ve decided
- tae gong shil
just follow me for tonight
- where
- it s probably going to be a setting where the richest people of this country will be gathering
but first we need to get you some clothes
something black and elegant
the chairman of giant group just passed away
his son is the president of giant mall
you didn t have to tell you love me if you just needed me to come here
it was just really bad timing
i don t believe you
i ll just go turn on my radar
chairman lee yong jae of the giant group lost his battle with his illness earlier today he passed away at his vacation villa in chungpyung
following the wishes of the late chairman lee yong jae only a small funeral will be held with his closest family members and friends
towards the end he left everything to his wife and son and he spent his last days at the villa with his hired help
that man was known for his quiet life and his devotion to his family but betrayed his entire family in the worst way possible in the end
everyone is looking nervous because they fear that woman would show up
his son the president of giant mall he must ve been really shocked he hasn t shed a single tear
that man over there is the president of giant mall
wow
what is it
did you see something
he s so handsome
with all the badmouthing you did i thought that he d look really mean and vulgar
but he s so dashing
we re in the middle of our date how dare you look at another man
turn on your radar and find the ghost
don t touch me while i have my radar on
you know that my radar charges a rate per job right
make sure you pay up when i find you that rich ghost
president joo - long time no see
- yes hello
is she with you
- she s my girlfriend
- oh really
bring her with you to our next company event
yes i understand
what are you doing
why are you calling me your girlfriend to all your rich friends
if i don t say the same thing to my friends that i did for your friends you ll be upset
are you picking up anything
no nothing yet
i ll go see what i can find
i m trying to handle it but it s still getting to me
chairman
i met him
met who
the man in that picture that s the chairman right
yes it is
he asked me to do something for him
sit down and get some rest mother
he says there s something that his son can never find out about he wants me to get rid of it for him
father
father
father
you ve kept it hidden your whole life but you ultimately got caught in the end
the last person that the chairman was with was a woman that he has spent his whole life to keep hidden
he wants to get rid of all her stuff
i don t want to get involved in his messy personal business
it would ve been nice if he had told you some big business secret or something
i noticed that the president of giant mall didn t even shed a single tear and he didn t look like he was doing so well
i think it was really traumatic for him to lose his father like he did
he s not the only one who have lost his father like that
if that mystery woman makes an appearance i m sure that ll cause some problems with the inheritance
i want that woman to come on the scene and drop a huge bomb on the giant mall president s face so pretend not to know anything and just leave it alone
he looked like a nice person and we have to stop any bombs from exploding in his face
who s side are you on
let s leave together tomorrow afternoon
since it takes about two hours to get to the vacation villa in chungpyung we should be able to be back before the sun goes down
- my vacation villa is in yangpyung
- are you bragging right now
chairman told me that his vacation villa is in chungpyung
i have no intentions of going with you to chungpyung to help him
but if you want to enjoy yourself we can get on the road right now to yangpyung
yangpyung that s a really nice place isn t it
enjoy what
forget it
don t worry tae gong shil
i can go there just to sleep with your hand held in mine
i ve put all my faith in you but if you can t put your faith in me then that would be very disappointing to me
where do you think you re going
- i can t go with you to yangpyung
- we re not going there
we re just going back to our own separate homes
just what are you thinking of
i ll take you home
why are you toying with me like this
are you teasing me
i m just going along with your ghost ventures
you and i are from two different neighborhoods and it s not like your ghost ventures are any fun either
but since i like you i just want to go along with you on your ghost ventures
when you re no longer afraid of all these ghosts and when you feel that you ll be able to handle them on your own then tell me to stop
and i ll go back to my own neighborhood
you told me there would be an end to this didn t you that too is your responsibility
yes i should do that
i need to end it nicely one of these days
let s not become like that wolf and the lamb from that story
what happened to them at the end
there s a fairytale version of that story
read it if you are ever able to
are you disrespecting me right now because i can t read a children s book
if that s how you re going to play it then we re going to yangpyung right now
then go ahead if you want to go
i have no intentions of just holding your hand and going to sleep
you told me to have fun with you and send you back when i m done didn t you
i heard you loud and clear
but for now just take me back to my house
since this is a funeral home a ghost might follow me back home
okay
but you never know
joong won broke off his engagement again
i was feeling nervous about it i had hoped to have the wedding while you were here but out of the blue he called off the wedding
how many times has he done this now
is it three or four
this is the fourth one
i guess we ll be hearing about joong won s curse again
do you think that joong won is acting like this because of that girl cha hee joo
i m positive that s not the reason this time
there s a girl named bang shil
it s not bang shil but it s tae gong shil tae gong shil
tae gong shil has a special ability to see dead people and she claims that she saw cha hee joo s ghost
that prickly son of mine believes that nonsense of a story
yes and because of that
i don t think he ll believe that this is a picture of living cha hee joo
what do you think kang woo
since you ve kept close to her and have been keeping an eye on her
i too believe what tae gong shil claims
tae gong shil
drive home safe
that wolf and lamb story you mentioned
- what s that story called
- the title of that book
there s an animated version of that story you should just watch that instead
it s just that the book has a rather sad ending
- you can t read books anyways
- i m not going to ask you to read it to me
president joo i ve been giving it some thought at first i was offended to hear you say that i m a play thing or a sort of entertainment but when i tell people my ghost stories they tell me that they think that i sound ominous and i m a bad omen so i think what you re saying is better than that
so let s remain friendly and enjoy our time together
drive home safely
okay
let s remain friendly and have some fun and the wolf will go back to the wolf s house and the lamb will go back to the lamb s just as they should
okay this is the way it should be
filled to the brim like this
so who s been emptying it every day - it s so strange
- tae gong shil
kang woo
you seemed upset when you left earlier are you okay now
why are you dressed like that
did you go to a funeral
yes
you can call it my spy outfit of sorts
did president joo joong won take you there and use you for his benefit
excuse me
president joo said that he s keeping you by his side to use you for his own good
is what he said true
it is true that he is using me but we ve also decided to remain friends and have some fun with each other
i heard that he broke off his engagement and that you were the cause of it
is he telling you that you re the only one for him now
kang woo you once told me that when you re not being honest with your heart the pain you feel is your answer right
he s telling me that he s being honest with his heart but the pain i think is my burden to bear
go on up
you look uncomfortable in that dress
i ll take care of this down here
kang woo were you the one emptying out these can
i guess i should be honest with you on this one
yes i ve been doing it
every single time
i owe you a big apology
since i told you that i liked you
then let s do it together
tae gong shil
did you really see cha hee joo s ghost
yes
what kind of reckless driving is that
you must ve been startled
i m so sorry
if you drive out so suddenly like that
are you okay
i m so sorry
i recently moved here from england and i m not used to driving on the opposite side of the road
- are you okay
- yes i m okay
i ve seen around before
you re from england you say
yes
i ve seen the two of you going for walks around here a few times myself
you looked like nice neighbors and i ve been meaning to introduce myself
why don t we get together for some tea sometime soon
yes i d like that
joo joong won s aunt that s her right
i ve never been in this room before
we should probably clean up in here before his son comes to visit right
have you ever met the chairman s girlfriend
i ve noticed a faint trace of a woman s perfume on the chairman once in awhile but i never knew that he d sneak her in here to have a secret rendezvous
don t touch that
why does it feel so chilly in here all of a sudden
i bet the late chairman doesn t want us touching his things
let s just leave everything the way it is until his son comes to clean it up himself
it hasn t even been that long since the funeral of the chairman but some questions have been raised about him dying in the arms of his secret lover
i guess that ll give the president of giant mall some trouble
he ll be here soon to discuss the logistics of kingdom s parking ramp entrance
- okay i understand
- and ms tae ms tae seems to want to meet him as well
i haven t seen the chairman since the funeral i thought that maybe i d see him hanging around his son
are you now starting to seek out these ghosts on your own
aren t you afraid
he wasn t scary looking at all if anything he looked kind of sad
when i saw him at the funeral i smelled a very strong scent coming from him
it smelled like perfume so i m looking to see if i can find the scent and this is the perfume
the scent of the woman that the chairman is longing for
do you think it s possible that if i smelled like this scent then he may come to talk to me again
are you attempting to lure in a ghost now
i told you that i m pretty popular amongst ghosts even if i don t try to lure them in
right
are you by any chance having tea time with your ghost friends right now
there s a kid here who really likes his coffee but he brought a friend today
is it by any chance the trash can man
no he never moves from his spot
- he doesn t really talk to me either
you mentioned that you re not really friends with that ghost
did she find it and not wear it
or maybe she never got it
maybe she was offended because i threw the necklace away for her to find
giant mall s president should soon be here
it s time for you to go to the conference room
- yes okay
- are you bothered by something
i should no longer feel bothered now that i ve let everything out in the open but it continues to weigh on me
are you referring to the issue you re having with the parking ramp entrance
no forget it
chief secretary kim - i need you to find me a book
- a book
are you thinking of trying to read a book on your own
president joo when are you going to visit your father
he s staying at the kingdom hotel
i m always at kingdom so tell him that he can come see me at any time
you know very well that he s not someone who d come to you first and give you an explanation
he should know that i m also not someone who will go to see him first and give any sort of an explanation
the two of you are so alike i guess you guys won t be meeting this time either
chief secretary kim
here comes the president of giant mall
it s the chairman s son
excuse me a moment
the giant mall president has laid eyes on ms tae
he s initiating a conversation with her
that s a very unique scent
what s the name of the perfume are you wearing
um i don t really remember the name of the perfume but i can show you the bottle
please do
then follow me
those two are heading off somewhere together
that s not the direction of the conference room
i think they re going to tae gong shil s office
why is giant mall s president following a woman that he s only met once
do you think that she told him that he has something by his side
i m sure there is something there
she told me that it made a request for her to go somewhere
and where is that place
giant mall chairman s vacation villa in chungpyung
ah so she must ve been wondering where in chungpyung the villa was located that must be the reason why she wants to meet the president of giant mall
then i guess those two will be driving up there together
it s not like giant mall s president is married or anything i m sure that he s feeling a lonely since the recent death of his father
i bet ms tae will be a great comfort to him
chungpyung
that s a wonderful place to heal one s soul under the warmth of the bright sun
isn t it your role to follow her when things like this happens president joo
you can t just let them go off on their own can you
i really didn t want to go because it s too bothersome but i guess i have no other choice but to go there myself
it s this bottle
it s the same scent
it s the same scent that you used to smell on the chairman isn t it
did you know my father
i ve only met him once
by any chance are you the one
my mother never wore any perfume
although i have smelled a woman s perfume on my father once in a while but i still trusted my father
it s not me
that s a relief
i would ve despised my father even more if she had been such a young woman
he really hates his father
i forgot to ask him where the villa is in chungpyung
tae gong shil let s go to chungpyung
i ll go with you
you said you don t want to go because you wanted to throw a bomb in his face
no i ve met the chairman a few times myself so i have to help him keep his secret hidden
let s go
what is it that you wanted to see me about this time
the rumor of tae gong shil s relationship with president joo is spreading all over the place thanks to you and your loose mouth
but this time it s not your mouth that i need but it s your ears
my ears
what is it that you need to hear
tae gong shil attended hankuk university but she never graduated
she got into a big accident so she had to drop out before graduating
and we know that s why she s the way she is now
i need you to find out the details of that accident
why do you need to know that
it seems like president joo has fallen completely head over heels for her if she s been seriously injured from the accident then i don t know if she s someone whom joong won should marry
that s why i want to find out more about it
i feel a bit guilty about this now that we ve gotten a little close
who s the blabbermouth working for the vice president
i don t think it s anyone from the security team
- i think it s someone from the pr team
- really but i did hear a rumor that the blabbermouth is looking into gong shil s past
what about my gong shil s past
i heard that she got into an accident when did that happen
- it happened seven years ago
- seven years that was a long time ago
but it s only been four years since she left the hospital
she was in the hospital for three years
it must ve been a bad accident
what was it
a car accident ugh my heart still feels like it s going to jump right out of my chest whenever i still think about that accident
i really don t want to talk about it
it must ve been really difficult for you
how about we grab some dinner together tonight
dinner
since you seem to be so upset by this i thought i d treat you to a nice dinner
should we
i love going out to nice dinners
okay
okay then
yes thanks for the coffee
she s so gullible that i think a little alcohol would get her to start talking but why do i feel so guilty about doing that to her
i need to get my head on straight
the president of giant mall was preoccupied by other thoughts during the whole meeting
but thanks to that the parking garage problem is going to end up being more advantageous on our side
i think that he feels really betrayed by his father
- he says he feels really betrayed
- if he had been trained at a young age then he d be able to ignore that just fine
do you not
like your father very much either
we don t really like each other
anyways is it okay for us to just barge into his villa
i don t really want to go back to jail for breaking and entering
since he asked me to go i bet the chairman would be waiting for us when we get there
i m sure he ll show us in
this is the room
he s sitting right over there
please excuse our brief intrusion
okay he wants us to delete the photos of the woman in the camera
he doesn t want anyone seeing these pictures
forget it i don t want to see it either
let s just delete them quickly and get out of here
okay
did you take these pictures yourself
all the pictures are so pretty
we didn t clean the room and left the room just as it is
i ll take care of cleaning up the stuff in this room
i m going to burn everything in this room so start a big fire for me
yes sir
there aren t any other exits or any room for us to hide
i have to delete these photos
you can t delete them now
we have to use the photos to explain what we re doing here if we get caught
he asked me to make sure that his son never sees these photos
we have to show them to his son so that we can get ourselves out of here
yes
this is kingdom s president joo joong won
president joo joong won
the parking entrance agreement that we negotiated today seems to favor my mall heavily so i m calling you about it right now
we actually were thinking that we made a mistake after the meeting was over
so i appreciate you calling me like this
let s renegotiate the deal we ll take your position into consideration
come back to our kingdom office immediately
i m out in chungpyung at the moment
you have to come immediately come immediately before i change my mind
yes i ll do that
i ll be right there
he s gone
of course he is
you probably can t even fathom how much money i just gave up
i think the chairman appreciates for what you just did
hand it over i ll delete them
i told you that can t allow anyone to see it
then do it quickly
i don t want to see it either
but that chairman only cares about keeping that woman hidden i guess he doesn t care about his son s feeling
a businessman so preoccupied by grief he almost let an important business deal like that slip out of his grasp
rather than keeping his woman hidden when he met you shouldn t he be asking you to go to his son and apologize for him shouldn t he feel bad for what he s done
if this is how he was going to end it then he should ve made sure to prepare his son for this kind of situation
but he was so firm about keeping his secret yet all he did was drop the biggest bomb on his son before he died
this must be the woman
is this the woman
okay then hurry up and delete them and let s go
president joo
the chairman would like for me to show you these pictures
tell him i don t want to see them
no you should
he wants to know what you think his son would feel if he saw these pictures
he wants you to take a look and give him your opinion
he s asking me
i ve already been trained by my father about keeping all sorts of women so i don t think it s really going to faze me at all
lies
yes president joo
i m on my way right now
turn around and come back
i m at your villa in chungpyung right now in the room where your father passed away
excuse me
what are you two doing in here
you
you told me that it wasn t you but it was you after all
are you my father s woman
get yourself straight
she s mine
the woman your father was trying to keep hidden is right here
are you trying to use this picture to threaten me right now
then take your giant mall and get out of my kingdom s sight
is it possible for you not to open your mall
whatever it is that my father left behind that s my father s problem
i m sure that it may be a bit of a shock i m never going to let that shake my resolve or make me crumble
even though i may hate my own father i will never allow anyone else to wag their fingers at him
then take a look
chairman
rather than trying to protect your son i think it would be better to let your son protect you
this is the only picture of her that s left in this world
this is the woman that your father has spent his whole life kept hidden away
he says that s the woman that he kept secret from everyone
there were so many things that he needed protect so he said he had to keep his secret hidden his entire life
the perfume that you smelled on your father once a while was probably the scent of his true self
he wanted to take one final picture of that woman before he passed away
he said he wanted to have a private funeral for her on his own but he unexpectedly collapsed
he said that you d be disgusted by him if you found out the truth and that s why he wanted to hide the truth
everything that my father spent his whole life protecting i have to continue protecting them
as for a funeral for this poor woman her son will hold one for her
my father is flying back out tomorrow morning
he still has no inclination to come see me before he leaves
i ve been told that he is expecting you to come see him
seeing how he hasn t come by to give me an explanation about the necklace s whereabouts do you think that s because he stole the necklace and has it in his own possession
or it s possible that he knows something and he s just trying to protect his son
team leader kang told me that he told your father about tae gong shil
your father is concerned that she s got you fooled with some nonsense and that she may end up taking advantage of you somehow
if you don t go and talk to him yourself he may have team leader kang bring ms tae in so that he could meet her for himself
what is giant mall s president doing back here
i told him that i wasn t going to renegotiate our business deal
seeing how he s here with that big bouquet of flowers i don t think it s you that he s here to see
once a person feels the warmth of the sun they always want more
that s a huge bouquet of flowers that he s holding in his hands
doesn t he have anything better to do
he could ve just had it delivered
it s much better to give the flowers in person
that way he can make sure for himself that she receives the flowers
tell me for sure whether she got the necklace or not
if she took the necklace then flip over that lid for me
so she did get the necklace
that s good
did she like the necklace
she must ve not really liked it
she liked it that much
if i had given it to her directly i could ve seen for myself how much she liked it
but i told myself that i wasn t going to do that no i won t do it
ms tae is a very special person to president joo
is there a reason why ms tae must stay here at kingdom
yes
because she s master joo s sun
i will make sure to relay your gratefulness to her
i m disappointed to hear that
please relay a message to president joo for me tell him that i have a telescope too
here have some of this too
yes
deputy kim and manager park in the pr department
ah i see
so i just need to clear up the misunderstanding okay
excuse me
the thing that the parking attendant mr kim lost where was it again
oh in the parking garage
behind the shopping cart
okay i got it
yes i ll find it for him
and what else
wait don t jump out and scare me like that
if you act like this i m not going to talk to you guys anymore and call in president joo
you all know what happens when i touch him don t you
ms tae gong shil doesn t really visit president joo s office these days
that s a relief to hear
- are you here to shop
- yes you as well
my nephew is the president here and my husband is the vice president
ah i see
you re not married are you
- no i ve always been too focused on work
- i see why don t you come over to my house for dinner sometime
my nephew lives in the same building
yes thank you for the invitation
she s not bad
i forgot to ask her for her name
long time no see joo joong won
president joo is here to see you
i m here
i didn t think that you d come
i came because i m confident that nothing you have to say will faze me
if you want to hear what i have to say you need to start talking first
okay fine
hee joo was one of the culprits
i was completely deceived by her i told her all about my mother s necklace as well
i swear to you that i gave them the necklace as your ransom
i believed hee joo when she came to pick up the ransom
my priority was to save you so i gave her the necklace like a fool
so you and i were both completely deceived by cha hee joo
since the statute of limitation will soon be over that incident will be over and out of my life for good once and for all
joong won
you still can t read since that incident can you
are you sure that it ll be over for you when you re still suffering like that
no i can t read
but there is something that i ve recently found myself wanting to read
the reason why i came here is because there s something that i want to show you
once you see this it may shake you back up again do you think that you can handle it once you ve seen what s inside
- is it something to do with hee joo
- that s right but if you don t want to see it i ll leave it with kang woo tell him to take care of it from his end
decide for yourself whether you want to look at it or not and if you do end up looking at it
ask kang woo to explain the contents
you may leave now
father not telling me about you paying the ransom until now was it because you were afraid that i d be hurt by the truth did you try to turn it around and make it look like you were to blame
you can believe whatever you want to believe
have you ever been suspicious of what my true intentions were of you
you can believe whatever you want to believe as well
take care of yourself
cha hee joo
- you startled me
- those are the books that you requested
why are there so many
- it s not just a single book
- there are a few of them and there s a ton of writing in there too
- there are six books in total
- do you want me to read them to you
no that s okay
i ll try reading them myself
pok poong chin-neun bam-ae on one stormy night
wow what a coincidence
the first night you met ms tae was a stormy night like that too
you knew that cha hee joo was one of the culprits right
- that s
- president joo met with his father today and he told his father everything
he did
you ve met cha hee joo s ghost but were you not able to find out anything about the other kidnapper
i did see her but she didn t tell me anything that was helpful
until president joo can solve all the mystery surrounding cha hee joo he probably wouldn t let you go would he
yes i guess you re right
but once the kidnapper is found i guess that s when things will end
if it s something i can do i want to help him find his answers before we end things
does this mean that you no longer have any more reasons to stay here at kingdom
no i m going to continue to stay here because i have to see things through in order to begin a new beginning
but i may move to a new place
you re moving out of the building
should i not go
shouldn t you be holding onto me and telling me not to go
since you re the building supervisor
- please don t leave
- but i ve already found a new place
but the supervisor is asking me to stay i guess i have no other choice
i won t go
was he just bragging to me because he got himself an apartment
you can t always be thinking about that
this could ve been just a joke
team leader kang - have you seen the news on the internet
- why you re the top searched topic on the net
- me
- yes
superstar kang woo
i m going to lose my mind
even though your picture didn t come out that great but you are still the top searched topic should we get you a pair of sunglasses
the person that i m dating isn t this man
the web team looked into this already
this man is the head of security at kingdom mall and it s seemed like you ve been visiting kingdom quite often lately
it s true that i ve been visiting kingdom quite often
if you ll just admit to the truth we ll write up a very nice story for you
it is true that the last man i dated is someone at kingdom mall
but it wasn t this guy
it was the president of that mall
joo joong won
- kingdom s president
- are you telling us the truth
there s going to be an article on president joo
tomorrow
wait tell them that we ll sue them if they publish a false story
okay
what article on joong won
they re going to publish an article on president joo s scandal with tae yi ryung
- what
- does your nephew have a girlfriend
no she s just someone who joined us for dinner a few times i guess it s deemed newsworthy with her being a celebrity
but it s totally untrue
we should deny those articles right
hold on let s first talk to joong won and then we decide
but president joo has tae gong shil
on top of all that tae yi ryung is her old schoolmate
i m sure that he ll tell us that the story is just absurd
i m going to use this to ask joong won just where he stands with that girl
your nephew s girlfriend isn t tae yi ryung but tae gong shil
i m sorry
here you are joining us for dinner for the first time and you re being exposed to all our messy family stories
it s okay
it s very interesting
ms tae
where was the place that you decided on
what
you told me that you ve decided on a place before we went to the funeral where was it
why
you re the weird one here asking me as to the reason why
i m suggesting that we go there
why
do you not want to
if you want to go then wait here for just a moment
what is this he told me not to fall for him no matter what
is he telling me to wait for him or not
i ve been preparing myself for this
i ve been avoiding you all day but i guess you ve caught me
i don t have much time so you ve got exactly ten minutes
the broken pottery and engagement i guess you re up since seven
joong won i heard that there s an article being written on your scandal with tae yi ryung
- who
- yi ryung
this should at least be twenty minutes of conversation don t you think
i ve been pretending that i never got the necklace and if i put the necklace on now he s going to think that i want something
should i not let him see that i like him just even this much
well this doesn t matter to me at all
since tae yi ryung is kingdom s model we should stop this article for the sake of our image
is that really the only reason
it s not because of tae gong shil
for a man who breaks off his engagements like it s his hobby i knew that you wouldn t care about a article that you won t even read about but i heard that tae yi ryung is her old schoolmate
you sure you re not just trying to protect gong shil
tae gong shil doesn t care about things like that
i ve already told you this before but she ll never leave my side over something like that
that s what i find to be even more weird
how could she not care about something like that
when i told her that you were getting married she just kept her eyes on that vase and only talked about other things
that s right
think of her as someone living on a different planet and just leave her alone
she s not someone you can scare away with your usual methods
you won t even faze her
doesn t she even have any self-respect
does she love you that much
that woman has no self-respect
there s a reason why she can t let go of me so she doesn t have the luxury to hold onto any self-respect
even when i tell her that i love her she doesn t even have the luxury to accept my love
that s why she s safe
isn t that right
yes
when you told me that you only had ten minutes to give me is it because you were taking her to go somewhere
let s go
tae gong shil
you heard everything that we just said right and you still want to leave here with joong won
yes
it doesn t really matter to me
because i don t have that luxury
let s go
joong won
that expression on your face right now doesn t seem like she s very safe to me
president joo i ve decided
home is where i wanted to go next
i want to go home
i m tired
i m going home
i shouldn t have allowed him to see it
tae gong shil
i know that you re in there so come out right now
you told me that you could handle anything so why are you crying
it bothers me to see you cry
who are you
ah are you that jerk joo joong won
joo joong won
- what s wrong with you - why did you come here
do you take her that lightly
how can you be all about yourself you bastard
are you possessed by something right now
are you not tae gong shil right now
no i m not you bastard
i heard that you re just playing around with her
you know what she told me you re a filthy and dirty player
so just quietly let her use your body stop hovering around her and get lost
i told you to get lost
why aren t you getting lost
i just grabbed you
i left but i came back because i was angry
things like that happens
what do you know about ghosts i may not know about ghosts but i ve chased plenty of them away
because of you having chased a few ghosts away this girl can t even do anything and she s in a lot of pain
she s says she s in a ton of pain you awful bastard
i got it so let me talk to tae gong shil
she says she has nothing to say to you so leave
you
you don t know how the walnut cracking lady left do you
what
did you smack her watch closely and come back to me

[ next episode preview ]
i need to find the person that you re trying to protect who s the dead one here
- he still can t read can he
- how did you know that about my nephew
i can t stop myself from falling for you and that upsets me and wounds my pride
i ll protect you like that wolf
we re just going to hold hand and sleep
don t even think about anything else
i think she lost her child i can see her lost child standing next to her
- miss are you looking for something
- i think i ve found him there you are
tae gong shil where are you right now
tae gong shil
tae gong shil
i love you
episode 13
i heard that this happened because he was with you
i knew that i sensed something bad about you
- i told you to stay away from him didn t i
madame joo
how s my joong won doing
his heart stopped for a moment during the operation but fortunately his vitals are back to normal and we ve been able to continue on with the operation
then he s not dead
president joo is still alive
he was fortunate that it didn t pierce his heart
we were able to safely complete the surgery
so he didn t die after all
i guess he just briefly stepped out of his body like that lady from the hotel
i need to see him
he thinks that he s dead i need to check and make sure that he s back safely
what do you mean he s dead
how dare you say he s dead
don t ever don t ever come near joong won again
- ms tae
- how s president joo
he was able to complete his surgery safely
is he awake
his aunt isn t by his bedside right now
even for a brief moment why don t you go in and see him
thank you
following too deeply into your world is dangerous
i ve already fallen as far as i could fall
i was so preoccupied with keeping my eyes on you i must ve been completely entranced by you
i m sorry
i m sorry
how s president joo
is tae gong shil still here
i saw president joo
he thought he was dead he came to say goodbye to me
what if he doesn t come back
i can see ghosts but i can t call them out
darkness swallows up the light and death will ultimately swallows up a life
i have to go see that lady
because he saw the sun that shines in the darkness of death his soul probably thinks that he is dead now
he s probably unaware that he s still alive and that he has to go back
you re saying that he s not coming back because he saw me
he s probably preparing himself to disappear
joong won
are you able to read now
it s because i m dead
so you can finally see me now
we can now finally be together
you have to summon his spirit
i have to tell him that he s not dead and that he needs to go back
i can t see spirits like you can but i can control the spirits
please summon him quickly
he may never be able to go back if we wait too long
what can you do for me if i were to help you with your request
i need your skills
can you offer yourself to me as a sacrifice
what will happen to me if i offer myself as a sacrifice
you will no longer be able to live your life the way you want
why
do you need to think about it
there s not much time
sacrifice or whatever else i ll be whatever you want
just please help me get him back
the deal has been made
okay i will now summon forth your man s spirit
in order to summon him i need a special item
an item that he d be able to recognize
is that proof that you re his sun
i think that would work just fine
as i ve already told you he believes himself to be dead because he saw you when his spirit briefly left his body
it may be heartbreaking but in order to summon him and return him back to life all the moments when you shone so brightly for him must be erased from his memories
are you saying that he won t remember the moment when he came to see me
i love you
i said all the moments the sun all the memories of you being with him
you re telling me that he s not going to remember anything at all
it s a choice that you need to make if you want to bring him back
will you be okay with that
it doesn t matter
i was intending to burn out the brightness of this crazy sun from his life anyways
well then in that case
joo joong won
let s see if we can find him
you are not dead
you have to go back
the only thing that s going to disappear is that light
don t forget the deal that you and i made
he s probably back safely in his body
joo joong won
wake up
i ve waited 15 long years for the statute of limitation to run out and for the day when i would finally get to meet you
wake up
president joo
please please open your eyes
are you awake
you re awake mr joo joong won
your aunt is waiting outside i ll go get her for you
she ll be so happy to see that you re awake
the patient is awake
joong won is awake
that s such a relief
tae gong shil i m sincerely making this request from you this cannot go any further
- it s such a relief that he s awake
- wait out here
i ll get you in there to see him once his aunt leaves
no it s okay this is the end
i won t go any further than this
president joo is going to want to see you once he s fully awake
no he won t
i m not going to appear in his life anymore
joong won i really thought i was going to die from worrying about you
what happened to me
what do you mean what happened
i told you to get rid of her
you almost died this time following her there
follow who
who are you talking about
- chief secretary kim
- master joo you re awake
it s such a relief
why am i in here
did i really get struck by lightning
what do you mean he won t be able to remember you
i was told that he wouldn t
since he was hurt because of a woman who s able to see ghosts all his memories surrounding ghosts or me will be erased from him
the house that was in the way of my golf course being constructed
i remember going there with chief secretary kim
then let me get struck down by lightning
did i really get struck down by lightning because i was asking for it
that s the last thing that i remember
the night that you re referring to was a very long time ago
joong won do you really not remember anything
my whole body feels achy right now so i can believe that i was stabbed in the back by a screwdriver
but how did i end up like this
it s because you and tae gong
just get some rest for now
you need to recover first and we can organize your thoughts later
but who s that woman over there
i ll introduce you to her some other time
just get some rest for now
doctor please keep a close watch on joong won
- chief secretary kim - yes
- yes
let s go
how s your breathing it hurts
it hurts quite a bit
we will do a more thorough examination tomorrow
i m sure a further examination will confirm but i m sure it s just a temporary memory loss
something flashed brightly for a moment then it disappeared
you made a promise
but if you truly wish for me to get out of your life i ll understand and disappear at once
this must be that moment
it ll be a good thing if joong won never gets his memory back
i don t want anyone to ever mention that girl s name again in front of joong won
yes i understand
- chief secretary kim
- yes
please i beg of you
i understand
the rumor of master joo almost dying while he was with gong shil is everywhere
president joo and gong shil went to find the body of the missing boy and they had a run-in with the boy s killer
and president joo saved gong shil s life
how did tae gong shil know that that child s body was at that auto repair shop
you don t need to know
we can t even say anything about it anyways because president joo s aunt forbid us from mentioning gong shil s name around him
if she forbid you from mentioning her then you can t whisper about it either okay
here eat this
you should ve stayed at the hospital longer
why did you insist on coming home so soon
i can breathe fine on my own now and i feel more comfortable at home
will be you alright alone
why don t you come stay at my place
i already had the cook prepare all the dishes you like
can you bring it to me
i m starving right now
really
i ll go get it right now
then get some rest
what
do you have something to say to me
what happened to me
i get the feeling that my aunt is hiding something from me
make it simple and tell me what happened
there s nothing really specific that i can tell you
you ve been going into your office everyday and all the stores at kingdom has been performing very well too
you just happened to be at auto repair shop with one of your workers by coincidence
something important is missing here
and you know what that is don t you
i can tell that your lips are just twitching right now with what you really want to tell me
so just spill it out while my aunt isn t here
my lips aren t twitching
- what is this here
- i don t know why do you keep asking me
it s a children s book
why are these books doing in my house
no kidding
you can t even read
i really don t know anything so i have nothing to tell you
- what s going on with me
- how would i know
i really don t know anything
why am i able to read right now
president joo
can you really read what s written in that book
did i really get struck down by lightning
just what in the world happened to me
i guess i can wear this now that he won t recognize it when he sees it
it s a protective seal
yeah this is all i need
this is enough for me
tae gong shil you ve got a protective shield around your neck
what the heck
joong won
why did you come in to work
you should be at home resting
aunt you said that i got stuck in the back with a screwdriver didn t you
i think that had some magical effect or something
i can read now i can easily read every single word
[ kingdom - we will make all your wishes come true ]
i ve walked past that sign a thousand times and now i can finally read it
but who s responsible for that pr sign
that s the vice president s style
i m going to change it
gong shil he s finally able to read now
the trash can man told me about it
isn t it great
that s a relief
okay you re coming with me
chief secretary kim i can read all my files on my own from now on
i guess it ll cut down your workload by half i mean by ninety percent
i had a feeling that you would be able to
you ve been making a lot of effort to change
- i did
- yes
what s that
the ceo from the giant mall sent you these flowers to congratulate your recovery
i really can t wrap my head around this
when did the ceo of giant mall and i become close enough to send each other flowers
the two of you even went golfing together recently
golfing
that s just absurd
since you re here at the office let me know your decision on that personal matter which we haven t finalized
what personal matter
the police called to say they re presenting you with the courageous citizen award
to me
why
is it because of that rumor about me discovering that dead child s body and getting stabbed in the back
it s not just because of that
you also convinced an army runaway to turn himself in before he could hurt anyone so they want to thank you for your bravery with that too
- an army runaway
- yes you did that
i m sure that wasn t me
something s wrong here
it wasn t joo joong won but i bet it was joo joong two and joo joong three
this is all so ridiculous it s actually making me laughing
that joke wasn t funny was it
no it was all joo joong won
since you re already here at the office please finalize your paperwork on the child abuse center that you ve agreed to open up and finance
wait
i agreed to financially support a child abuse center
not adding another annex to kingdom nor adding another parking garage - but a child abuse center
- yes that s what you said you were going to do
i m sure that my aunt must be feeding me some sort of drugs
i need to ask her what kind of drugs she s been feeding me
no
i think i need to go in and get another brain scan
chief secretary kim
did you not find it strange when i suddenly started doing things that i ve never done before
did the sun rise upside down during the time that i can t remember
i m not sure
maybe you had a very special sun orbiting around you
president joo seriously doesn t remember you
no he doesn t
amazing isn t it
at first i thought that voodoo lady was just a scheme artist but she really is gifted
are you sure you don t need to talk to him
president joo s completely recovered now and he s perfectly fine it was unfortunate that he was hurt but that was just an accident it wasn t your fault
yes it was an accident
i know that
but that really woke me up and set me straight
i ve always thought that people that are visible to everyone are much scarier than ghosts whom no one else can see
i met him after being scared by the things that only i can see i was torn between my world and the reality
i was so happy to be around him because that meant i finally found a space for me to breathe
i never considered how deeply i had pulled him into my world when he could see none of what i see
although i can see but i wasn t cautious enough so i put him who can t see in a dangerous situation
i ve finally realized that i need to get my head on straight and live my life
i think it s true that people always have to lose something to see clearly
you know that s not what this is
i know that you really truly liked him
those feelings what are you going to do about them
it s sealed in here
since i m still holding onto my feelings that i have for him they haven t disappeared
so i will be okay
i should be walking this way so why did i feel the need to walk that way
look at that
this was just a storage room
who are you
when did this turn into an office
it s the special guest center
it s an office that you had set up yourself
special guest center
i created something so useless as that
what about you
kang woo
you re the new security team leader right
the guy that vice president recruited you have enough credentials to work security at the blue house right yes
and this is
she s the employee in charge of this office
this is her last day here so she s cleaning out her office
i see
is there anything else that you d like for us to do
no i don t
did i leave something there
ahh my back
just leave your stuff here
i ll bring them home to you later
actually why don t i just come with you
it s okay
there s not that much for me to take anyways
what kind of a weak seal is that
no kidding
i can t let you to walk out of here when you re about to cry any minute
i have my gong shil
that gong shil you gave me is a huge comfort to me
i can even read now so why do i feel so plugged up as if something s still stuck
master joo gave me this picture right before he was injured
is this picture the reason why the chairman met with master joo
yes
this picture was taken a year after cha hee joo died
he asked me to find out if cha hee joo had a twin
i wonder what master joo was planning to do by finding out about this woman
he was trying to forget about cha hee joo since he met ms tae
so why was he trying to find her twin sister
there s something that you re not aware of
the late cha hee joo was one of the culprits involved in president joo s kidnapping
what do you mean by that
there s a very high chance that her twin in that picture was her co-conspirator
co-conspirator
are you alright
you seem really shocked by this news
then
master joo knew all about this but why did he keep it to himself
he knew right from the start that cha hee joo was one of the kidnappers
he figured out from that picture that she had a twin sister and that she must ve been her co-conspirator
there s a chance that the girl in that picture could reappear in president joo s life
we must find that girl in the picture
hee joo was a kidnapper and han na was her co-conspirator
no that can t be
han na was such a bright and kind child
congratulations on your acceptance into the university
thank you uncle
- your new parents are happy about it
- yes of course
- i m going to korea soon
- korea
uncle didn t you tell me that i m a twin
i want to go and find my sister
i ve made efforts to find her myself ever since i ve been reunited with you but i haven t been able to find her
they say that there s a special connection between twins i may be able to find her if i go to korea myself
i m going to find her
okay
my sister is dead
why did you leave her all alone instead of searching her - han na
- i hate you
the dead girl s name was cha hee joo
cha hee joo
unlike han na who lived a happy life in england she lived a very unfortunate and lonely life on her own
remember the name cha hee joo
and for the rest of your life feel sorry for her
i need to find han na
it s a security alarm that connects directly to the police
the police will come within a few minutes of you pressing that button
we need to stay cautious until we catch whoever is after president joo
i ll call you frequently so make sure to answer your phone
i ll be careful
i told you that i ve got my head on straight now
i m going to protect you from now on
kang woo i really appreciate that offer but i don t think that i should hold onto anyone and attach myself to anyone
not holding on is my way of protecting him
what are you doing here
i m not here to see you i came to see tae gong shil
i heard she no longer works for kingdom
what do you need to talk to her about
just go back if you re here to taunt her about what happened with president joo
she s having a hard enough time right now without you adding to it
president joo really doesn t remember anything about gong shil
president joo s aunt asked me not to mention anything about gong shil i just came to see if that s really true
so all that was true
oh my god
seeing how excited you are i guess i can t let you go in now
let go
when i m depressed i need to see others more depressed than me to feel better
why do you hate tae gong shil so much
i ve always hated her but i hate her more now because you like her
don t you dare continue to like her
if you continue to like her i m going to chase her around hating her and taunting her
if it upsets you to see me doing that to someone you like then stop liking tae gong shil right now
you really are a freak
you really are a black whiskered whale that doesn t exist at all
what
black whiskered whales don t exist
i looked it up there are white whiskered whales but black whiskered ones don t exist
really
i m pretty sure i saw those whales with the black whiskers on their faces
i wonder if it was just something in the water
so you remembered what i said and you looked it up
yeah i looked it up because i don t understand someone like you
why
because you want to keep me in your pond
i already told you that i don t want any part of that
you don t need to take care of me
just open yourself up to me
i m such an odd freak i ll be able to eat and survive on my own you don t have to feed me nor take care of me i m just going to grow larger so that you ll never be able to get rid of me
do you think that she views me like i view you
why
do you find what i m doing pathetic
no
it s cool
- it s cool
- being confident without begging - it s very cool
- really
yeah
seeing you has given me strength
because i was feeling pretty pathetic just about a minute ago but i think i need to become as cool as you
what the heck
are you saying that you re going to do that for tae gong shil like what i did for you
yeah
thanks
you just taught me something
hey
so all i did was just give him more courage to go to gong shil
kang woo can t go to tae gong shil like i do to him
i m dooley
something that doesn t exist on this earth
dooley
i m such an odd freak that even if you ignore me and not take care of me i ll survive just fine and grow big all on my own so that i ll grow big as a dinosaur that you ll never be able to ignore me
kang woo
gong shil
i can t allow dooley to fall into gong shil s arms
what should i do
i told you that i d introduce her to you didn t i
this is han na whom you met at the hospital
she helped me out a lot that day
i don t think president joo likes it when you bring a stranger into his home i don t think
aunt
i found these books here was i reading these books
they were in your home so i m sure they re yours
you realized that you can read again when you saw those books right
try to remember
it has something to do with a very special person
a special person
was there a special person in my life
those are my books
i left it here on that day when i was introduced to your maid i forgot and left them here
oh that s right you did
han na brought those books here
they re just children s books but it s still a great story the illustrations are great too those books are very special to me
so my books was the first thing you read since you regained your consciousness
that makes me feel pretty good to hear that
didn t you say that han na was the first person you saw when you regained your consciousness
you two must be fated to be together
i m even reading these days it s a six book series and my brain feels like it s going to split when i tried to read those books
so he can read those books now
i m happy for him
[ tae yi ryung ]
tae yi ryung
hi yi ryung
hi i have something important to tell you in person
you know that restaurant where we all met up at the last time
yeah
meet me there okay
those two were all googly eyed towards each other at that restaurant
i m sure he ll remember something if he was to see her there again
i really can t stand the thought of gong shil with a catch like president joo either
what s so important that you feel the need to call me out in the middle of the night
you have a top secret information about giant mall
wait right there i ll be there soon
tae yi ryung
tae tae
there s a tae something
are you okay
please don t misunderstand what just happened
i just grabbed you because i didn t want you to fall
i was standing behind you because of that book
i happened to notice it because i m reading the same book
but i don t know if it s really appropriate for me to be saying this but did you feel that electric shock when we just touched
a real strong shock
no i didn t
did she think that i was coming onto her
even though your memories are gone you re still my protective shield
i know i felt something when i touched her
what could it be
it feels like something like that must ve happened before
master joo
a personal matter of mine came up i would like to take a few days off
chief secretary kim is asking me for some time off that s the first time in 15 years you ve made that request
now that you can read on your own you don t need me around as much
you don t need a recorder or an interpreter anymore
you re not just a recorder nor just an interpreter to me
do you remember what you requested of me in the beginning
you asked me to just be your recorder and interpreter
you re still holding a grudge against what a nineteen year old said
i always have a need to have you remain by my side
while i m gone deputy ahn from vice president s office is going to take over for me
okay
enjoy your time off
- where will you be going
- i m going to england
i m going to find my niece whom i haven t seen in a while
master joo
there s something that i must talk to you about when i return
you re not trying to seize this moment to abandon me and escape are you
i ve already told you there s no way that i can allow that
yes i know
enjoy a relaxing time off
keep your head up gong shil
han joo said he s going to refer you to a place that s much better than kingdom
if we re to be honest here tae gong shil isn t someone who should be left to rot away in that dungeon
- that s right
- you have a great education too you went to hankkuk university right
you re athletic and good at tennis with a talent for art and other skills you can even speak a foreign language french right
you re pretty and nice too many qualities to list all at once
- anyways you have amazing qualifications
- thank you but how is it that you know so much about me
no kidding
i don t remember telling you about all that
the blabbermouth who s works for the vice president told everyone
- blabbermouth
- someone you don t know
there s a jerk that s going around spreading rumors about you
han joo s going to find out who it is once he knows i m going to destroy that loudmouth
yes destroy
how about you give me a copy of your resume
i m going to take a quick look okay
in this area where you checked off having some sort of a medical history can you write down some more detail
i heard that you were in some sort of an accident
can you write down more details about some of the side effects from that accident and how your life has been affected
if that place is going to be that picky then just forget it
yes i think she s right
since i can t write down a bunch of lies i think it ll be better to not apply
thank you for your concern though
- i ll see you later - bye
it doesn t have to be detailed just a brief description will do
to be honest ever since the accident gong shil experience things that we can t really talk about
if she gets into trouble at a picky place like that it may put you in a difficult spot for recommending her so let s just forget about it
but i ll take you out for chicken entrails for all your troubles
i need to have that resume if i m to get the vice president to reimburse me for my expenses
this is a big problem
i m sorry please excuse me
that s a very pretty necklace
your nephew s girlfriend is not tae yi ryung so it s tae gong shil
tae gong shil
the sun
- is it in the shape of a sun
- yes thank you
cha hee joo
i m positive that it was cha hee joo
that woman just what did she see that made her call out hee joo s name
do you remember han na whom you recently met
- i m still hurting there
- oops sorry
i looked into her some more and she s a very famous curator
i told her to come to the office to meet with us there s a chance that we may have an exhibit from a well known artist this fall
didn t you tell me that she s from england
she is originally from england but she s lived all over the place such as l a new york and china i heard that she s moved around quite a bit in her life
but her family is extremely wealthy and she s quite smart too
ms han na is here
come on in
ms han na
what is it
no it s nothing please have a seat
are you saying that cha hee joo is still hovering around president joo
yes i m positive that i saw her
i heard that president joo is back to investigating cha hee joo s incident do you know what s going on with that at all
tae gong shil does it bothers you a lot when it comes to things related to president joo
it s because i can see hee joo i want to do whatever i can to help him resolve this issue
we have a lead on who hee joo s co-conspirator
it s possible that we may still be able to catch the culprit
- really
- once we catch the culprit everything should be resolved
president joo doesn t remember a thing about you which means he doesn t even know that you can see ghosts
even if you continue to see hee joo around i doubt you ll be able to pass along any messages to him
he s not going to believe anything that you ll say to him
i guess you re right
it s been fifteen years
i didn t think that you d ever come to england again
i came because there s someone that i must find
do you remember my niece
han na
han na brown
my father is english and my mother is korean
the truth is i was adopted
i was adopted but i ve heard about my birth parents and why i got adopted instead being raised by my own birth parents
i discovered my uncle when i was still a child
i see
he told me that my parents were struggling artists
they passed away in a car accident so i was given up for adoption because i had no family who could take me in
i was able to find han na who was adopted by her parents in england but i was never able to find her twin sister
han na grew up in a very happy home and had everything she ever wanted
but hee joo who remained in korea never had any of those opportunities
i thought she was just a lonely child who grew up alone and suffered a terrible and painful death
han na and hee joo i have absolutely no idea what happened when those two girls met
it s these two kids they said they were told to give your business card and take whatever toy they wanted
these are my business cards
i was told that i m planning to finance the child abuse center
are you the kids from that organization
you came to our apartment and gave us those cards yourself
you said that we can just give those cards and get whatever we wanted from kingdom
i m not the type of person who d leave my business cards with kids like you two
let them just take the toys that they already got but make sure that you tell them the rules and send them away
you had us read for you and told us that you re a special person to her
special person
you told us that you re a special person to gong shil
i m someone s special person
to gong shil tae gong shil who lives at our apartment
you said she s your sun
tae gong shil at your apartment
who s there
cha hee joo
you re in love with joong won aren t you
if you want to help joong won you have to lend me your body
team leader kang that s the woman president joo s aunt is trying to get him to marry
but i have a very strange feeling about this one
i heard that she lives in the same villa that president joo lives
- they live at the same place
- yes she must be very rich to live in such a grand place all by herself
i heard that she comes from england
why don t we have dinner together i ll have joong won come meet us
shall we
i think that the way my nephew looks at you is different from the way he looks at other girls
how do you feel about him
i m interested in him as well
then may i be direct and ask you about something that s been concerning me
that woman tae gong shil what was her relationship with joo joong won
the truth is she was pretty close with joong won
she talked about helping him heal a scar that some dead girl left and she attached herself to joong won s side
hee joo i assume
- did tae gong shil know the late hee joo
- there s no way that she could
she said some nonsense about calling hee joo s ghost to heal his scars or something
she s a woman who goes around talking about absolute nonsense
yes i see
calling forth a dead person s ghost
that really is all nonsense
shall we go
are you asking me to give you my body right now
can t i just relay the message to him for you
then will you be able to catch the culprit
one stormy night
that s the secret code that the two characters used in that book to recognize each other you know me don t you
who are you
are you my sun
i m leaving
i think i should just be a sun that only shines for those who are already dead
i only want to remain as a brilliant sun only for those ghosts
when i m by your side
that makes me really fear and hate myself
so it s not just that you re slightly disappointed when i m not around but i make you fear and hate yourself
i don t want to remain by your side only to become that kind of a sun
just tell me to get lost now
the only reason why i was able to tell you to get lost all this time without any fear was because i knew without a doubt in my mind that you d rise again by my side
i ll give it a try and do as you wish me to do
get lost my sun
master joo
i heard that ms tae is leaving for somewhere very far away
weren t you here with ms tae
where is she
episode 16
make sure to call me often okay
you re not going to stay away for too long right
i don t think i ll know how long i ll be until i actually get there
is he the one that s going with you
that man
he s the one from your accident right
that s why you shouldn t worry
i ll be back okay
okay
bye
- take care gong ri - okay
go
i ll call you
she left you
i thought tae gong shil would be fine as long as i handled everything
but she told me that she s afraid and it s too much for her
when i thought about it i never once tried to understand nor took it into consideration the situation that she may be in
then are you saying that you re being considerate and understanding of ms tae s situation and that s why you re letting her go
do i look crazy to you
to let tae gong shil leave me like this
why would i do something that i ve never done in 34 years of my life in such a pivotal moment like this
i don t understand nor want to be considerate of her wanting to leave me
please answer your phone
did you end things with that man
how could i have ended it
i just forced myself to walk away from him
i wish the plane would just take off already
it should get better once i put some distance between us right
i told kang woo that i was leaving today but he hasn t even called
his crappy dog manners
tae gong shil left on a flight headed for l a
get me a seat on the next flight out
i m going to follow her
yes i ll get you a seat on the flight as soon as i get your passport from the office
- joong won is going to america
deputy ahn received a phone call from chief secretary kim she just left for the airport with president joo s passport
why is he going to america all of a sudden
what could this be about
i m not sure
no it s nothing
once you go and pass the audition instead of returning to korea let s just stay there and hone your acting skills
i need to use the bathroom
- tae gong shil
- yi ryung
what are you doing here
are you going to america too
are you going to there on a business trip with president joo
no i m just going there to take care of some personal business
i read in the newspaper that you re going to america to film a movie
oh that i m just going there for an audition
- is he with you
- yeah
my seat is over there
come over to chat if you get bored
we went to school together
i got you a seat on a flight that leaves in two hours
- nothing sooner
- no nothing as of now
you just let tae gong shil leave
she told me that she was going to leave as soon as cha hee joo s case was resolved so you just let her leave instead of grabbing onto her and asking her to stay
i m not letting her leave
i m going to follow her and bring her back
even if you were to follow her there she has a two hour head start on you
what if you lose track of her during that time gap
this is a tracking device
take this with you
i wasn t sure what was going to happen so i put a tracking device in gong shil s bag
tae gong shil doesn t know that i did that
go and make sure that you find her and bring her back
you re a very clever man team leader kang
come back and work for me at kingdom again
i ll double your salary
turn it on for me
[ tae yi ryung ]
kang woo
did you know that tae gong shil is on her way to america
- how do you know that
- she s on the same flight that i m on
she s going to america with some man whom i ve never seen before
really
tae gong shil is on the same flight that tae yi ryung is on right now
the plane is still on the ground
hello
hello
hey
hey you dog
president joo joong won
ms tae yi ryung listen to me very carefully
i need your gifted acting skills right now
excuse me
hey
do you consider me a good actress
what
make sure you don t get yourself involved in the act that i m about to put on okay
yi ryung
what s wrong
gong shil
my stomach hurts
what what s wrong with your stomach
i don t know but it really hurts
i think it s my appendicitis
help someone help us
please we need some help
- is she okay - she needs help
gong shil
it s okay yi ryung
just hang on
- big sun - yes
stay with me
big sun
gong shil
don t leave me gong shil
- don t let me die
gong shil
gong shil
- big sun
no
come with me - you go on ahead
you re her guardian so you get in with her
tae gong shil
i never knew that a day would come when i d be impressed by tae yi ryung s acting
you managed to get her to stay but what are you going to do now
be understanding and considerate i m going to have to start doing those things
i want you to remain by my side and help me
i m not good at things like that so if it seems like i m doing it wrong you have to get on my case and if i try to deviate from it you have to stop me
just like what you ve been doing at my side for the past 15 years
yes i ll do that
but master joo i m a little disappointed
i ve been on your case for the past 15 years but you didn t even budge but look at how easily you ve opened up your heart to ms tae whom you ve only known for a brief while
it wasn t easy
you know that i m not that easy of a person
i m not so sure
- chief secretary kim
- yes
okay
little sun
you re acting way too normal for someone who was dying a minute ago
can t you tell by looking
i was faking it
i ve been taking acting lessons from an acting coach lately and my acting s gotten much better
i just got a script for a woman who has terminal illness maybe i should do that
did you get me off that plane just so that you could practice your acting on me
well i didn t really want to go to that audition anyways
and president joo joong won asked me to do it
he asked me to get you off that plane
- president joo asked you to do that
- i didn t want to do it either
i don t like seeing you being happy with someone as successful as president joo
it makes me envious of you
then why did you do it
because things need to get better for you and you have to become safe and happy
in order for him to stop watching over you and feel safe enough to leave your side i couldn t think of any other solution other than finding you happiness with president joo
that s why i helped him
if that s the case then you shouldn t have gotten yourself involved
because i was leaving so that i could be safe and happy
you seem to be saying that because you don t want to lose face in front of me but that s not at all how you looked
i love you too much and that s why i m leaving you
that s the candy fluff you re trying to play off right now
- candy
- that s right
i m not good enough so i m leaving for your own good
make me stay if you really love me
if you do then i ll relent and stay i know that s what you re doing
president joo did more than his share by getting you off of that plane
stop playing hard to get and let him grab onto you now
if you insist on dragging it out it ll only exhaust everyone involved
yi ryung i have a big fatal flaw so i can t pretend to be weak and just grab onto him
a fatal flaw
i think i know what it is
you need both kang woo and president joo to feel empathy for you and protect you
okay what is it
i see dead people
what
there s one in here too
i think he was a patient who passed away in this hospital room
i don t believe in things like that
okay anyways he wants me to pass along a message to you
he says he s a fan of yours
i m leaving now
hey tae gong shil
where are you going
if you leave me all alone after telling me something like that
it s scary
i really hate ghost stories
when i was being clingy but even when i m leaving i m still nothing but a gold digging candy girl in everyone else s eyes
woo jin it s you
but why are you still here
it s woo jin s mom
woo jin seeing you reminds me of a terrifying memory
i don t want to see you
mr joo joong won
you forcefully brought back the sun that was trying to leave
but did you manage to have her rise at your side again
- who are you
- i m the man that s leaving with gong shil
i m sure that gong shil must ve told you
i ve met someone who can see and hear the same things that i can
you re telling me that you see ghosts like tae gong shil does
unlike you i m someone who lives in the same world which gong shil lives in
ms tae
- chief secretary kim
- how could you have left without a word
were you running away to avoid master joo
i wasn t running away
- i was just going to search for something
- search for what
the reason why i ended up this way
i was leaving to search for a reason why i was made to be able to see dead people
are you saying if she goes to those places that she s been with you that she ll be able to find the reason why
i m not sure of that myself
we can only know once we get there
when you re not even sure of it yourself you were still trying to take her that far away from here
that s not what s important
what s important is that for the very first time gong shil has started to take a real look at herself and who she is
she s hid herself away living in torment while avoiding others all these years hasn t she
and when you appeared you were like a safe haven she could escape to
but now
gong shil is considering stepping out on her own away from you
that s why i came to see gong shil
what is it that you can do for tae gong shil
her memories from those three years that she roamed this earth as a spirit i m going to help her regain those memories
since that s when she started seeing spirits once she regains her memories of that time it ll transform gong shil
- how so
- she won t be afraid anymore she may be able to accept her ability to see spirits or it s possible that she may even lose that ability
you re saying that it s possible she may not be able to see ghosts anymore
yes
whether she accepts her ability or loses her ability the defense shield you can offer to gong shil will become meaningless to her
is tae gong shil aware of all this
yes
that s why she s coming with me
so you thought that i was leaving for president joo s sake
i was really only thinking of myself when i tried to leave
now that i think about it candy is much more of a romanticist than i am
to leave like that for the sake of someone else
i m not that innocent bright nor kind hearted like that
you ve changed a lot just like how master joo has changed
you used to say that you were just grateful to have someone like you
the sun that was crumpled down below is now saying how she wants to rise high up in the sun and shine brilliantly
and there s nothing i can do about it either i m at a loss for what to do
seriously
then do you think president joo could have the same misunderstanding
do i really have to put on my candy act
i m not sure
i m not sure where master joo stands
he s master joo
even though i had to force you to come back i feel like i can finally breathe again now that you re standing in front of me
listen president joo why did you hold me back
i was trying to leave for your own sake because i knew i wasn t good enough for you
who do you think you re talking to
do you think that i m going to run over to you and hold onto you from the back just because you re putting on that act
was i being that obvious
did the blunt and brazen sun all of a sudden become a moon of purity
i just thought that you d feel less offended and be a little bit more understanding if i told you that i did what i did for your benefit sake
even if you come off sounding really blunt i like you better when you re being honest
i don t like it when you change who you are which only ends up confusing me
okay then i ll be blunt and tell you how it is
i i m leaving for the sake of my own survival
it s not that i hadn t thought of you at all but my own well-being came first
initially i felt comfortable to cling onto you as my defensive shield
because i just clung onto you without having to think about anything else
then i started to have feelings for you i think that s when it all started
that s when i started hating myself for my ability to see ghosts
you told me that you d lower yourself as much as you can to suit me right
but i felt so pathetic about how low my life was
i can t live like this anymore
i need to find out why i ended up this way
i want to get rid of my ability to see ghosts if i can
can you find your reason and come back to me
i can t promise you that i ll come back to you
because if i don t change from the way i am now there s no way that i ll return to your side ever again
i told you didn t i i don t want to remain as the sun of misfortune at your side
the day that i got stabbed by the screwdriver i never should ve gone after you
and fortunately your life didn t end then you were able to find a way to continue on with your life the way you re meant to
can you understand what i m saying
i m not a dumb street mutt
i got it so you can give it a rest
thank you
seeing how you re able to walk around freely at a hospital when you once told me that it was the scariest place to you in the world i guess you won t be coming back because you missed having your defensive shield
i need to find another weapon to bring us back together
wait for me until i do
i m going to leave just like i had planned
then you ll be meeting some cops on your way to the airport
why
because you re a sexual molester
you ve touched every nook and cranny of my body
you even crawled onto my bed without my permission
you even paid me for the privilege of doing that didn t you
10 000 won
one million won
didn t you just tell me that you understood
even if i understood i have no intention of being considerate
there s no way that i ll just send you off peacefully
i m just going to start doing whatever i want from now on without a guilty conscience
you can handle everything from now on all on your own
once i think that you re no longer afraid of ghosts and that you ll be okay alone that s when you can tell me to stop coming and go back to my own neighborhood
that woman doesn t have any self-respect
there s a definite reason why she can t let me go and that s why she doesn t have the luxury to care about any self-respect
i don t get scared when i m sure of the ending
all i ever told her every day was for her to handle everything and that there was a sure ending for us and now i got what i asked for
but still
i got to tell her exactly how i felt
i love you
would that have been enough
i guess i must ve gone as far as what i feared in my worst case scenario
i totally forgot that i said those words to her
the things i said to madame go that was the worst thing i could ve said
death the end and not being attracted
i said some words that i never should ve said if it hadn t been for that specific situation
i don t want to retrieve those words just to complicate things again
no i m sure she didn t hear me say that
the deal with madame go is all over now i even paid her a huge amount of money so that she never comes back again
i need to say nicer words to her that way i can ask her how can she treat me so coldly like this
i heard that han na brown was the culprit
ugh it could ve been really bad for president joo
can you imagine how bad it would be if they got together like you wanted them to
i can t even fathom how shocked my joong won must ve been
you said that they were able to catch her all thanks to tae gong shil s help right
yes
honey what bang shil did was amazing
honey
joong won are you okay
aunt i m really struggling right now so let s do this some other time
okay
president joo i m sure that you must be exhausted
i ll take care of the shanghai meeting and the finalization of all the paperwork
i have both sides of my brain for that one to ponder business and the other side for my own personal life i can take care of them both myself
so both of you just leave
go i said
it seems as though president joo is suffering from the huge shock
i think he needs someone who ll be at his side to comfort and console him
he has me
yes i know that he has you what he needs now is a warm loving presence
who are you referring to
i m talking about bang shil
deputy ahn told me a few things and i guess tae gong shil was trying to leave for somewhere far away after she resolved the case for him
president joo went after her and got her back
my goodness my heart just breaks for them
i was really touched after i heard the story about the two of you from deputy ahn
you getting on that plane and master joo coming after you
that s just unbelievable
if you really want to test the boundaries of love getting on the plane and pretending to leave is a pretty good tactic to use you know your stuff
it wasn t like that
gong shil president joo went through all that trouble to bring you back and make you stay you shouldn t go
okay he s not the reason why i m leaving
hey that man
you told me that he even knows about the things you see
if he s telling you that he still likes you even after knowing all that then shouldn t that be the end of it
even in your eyes do you think that he s above my limit and i m playing hard to get undeservingly
ms tae gong shil you should give it a rest and stop playing so hard to get okay
why are you talking to my sister like that
ms tae gong shil
you re being asked to come to the vice president s office
- me
- yes
why
once she gets president joo s aunt s approval then i guess things will go the way that the vice president wanted it to go
i didn t think that it was possible for master joo and gong shil to work out i was starting to wonder if i got on the wrong side of the fence but it ends up that i had chosen the golden side of the fence
lee han joo you were on the vice president s side
of course i m the vice president s eyes ears mouth
i m his head shoulders knees and toes then were you the blabbermouth from the vice president s office
all those times that you took me out to eat jokbal and everything else it was all so that you could go around blabbing that mouth of yours
so you were just fishing for information
wait tae gong ri
i m not going to touch you nor provoke you for the time being
so stop with all that needless talk of leaving just to make things harder for my joong won right now
you two are telling me that you can t live without one another and it seems i ve just made things even more poignant and heart wrenching by getting in the middle of it
so i m not going to do that anymore
i trust that my nephew won t go off the deep end and he ll come back to his senses
no don t do that
i don t have the luxury to love anyone to the point of it being heart wrenching
you once told me that i was ominous didn t you
what you said was right
i ve dragged president joo into my life and made him stand on the brink on the death yet here i am staring into that face all over again i m never going to repeat that same mistake again
bang shil do you have a grudge against me because i was a bit harsh with you in the past
are you trying to get an apology from me or something
- is that it
i know that it s only because you love president joo very much
you re very precious to the person that i care deeply about
if anything i m grateful to you
are you trying to play me too
no
i m just going to leave you be and get lost for good
it seems as though you re starting to have some doubts
everyone can t seem to understand me they all thought the same that i was bluffing and playing hard to get
they think it s ludicrous that someone like president joo would want me to stay
then do you want to try remaining at his side and live your life together while enduring and handling what may come your way
because it seemed to me that he was ready to do that
you know that i can t do that
my decision to leave was an extremely difficult decision for me to make
even the thought of never being able to see him again makes me feel completely empty inside
this kid is he following you around
his name is woo jin
he follows me because he s really worried about his mom
- are you not going to help this kid out
the last time i followed this kid i almost caused joong won to die
i m going with you because i don t want to do anything like that again
then i ll wait for you at the airport tomorrow
it s up to you whether you ll come with me or not
so you re the cause of gong shil s agony huh
it seems as though even her final decision will all come down to you again
she s sleeping
after threatening me to come with the necessities after a fake hospitalization and she sleeps
it seemed like a big project led by a famous director
i wonder if she s making a huge mistake by letting go of this opportunity
seeing how she s sleeping so peacefully she seems perfectly fine to me
what the heck
did you attack me just now
even though i m a little flustered by your surprise ambush but i came prepared for it so i won t get mad at you
but are you sure that was enough
i was prepared for something even more drastic with you being the black whiskered whale and all
but thanks for such a bland ending
what
you really won t get mad if i do something more than that
no i wouldn t have gotten mad
it s an opportunity that you even gave up an international movie for but that s too bad
kang woo
that didn t count
i m going to do it right this time
there are reporters waiting outside
you can t come out there okay
i should ve just jumped on him
i was attempting to organize my thoughts in order to renegotiate with you i discovered a huge injustice along the process
the more i think about it the more ridiculous it all seems
what s ridiculous
you and i ve been taking turns talking about our end
when in fact we ve never even really started
we ve never once shared a meal or held hands without having a ghost involved
talking about our ending when there wasn t even a beginning
yes it s funny
i ve touched you grabbed you and poked you enough to get accused of sexual harassment
but i ve never once touched you just because i wanted to from liking you
forget all that talk about leaving and just grab my hand and let s just go grab dinner together
it feels weird
i think this is the first time i ve ever held your hand without there being a ghost
see
doesn t it feel unfair to just end it after only having held hands once
since i ve grabbed onto your hand why don t we go have dinner together
i ll just go in and change real quick
make it quick
enjoy your meal
this is my favorite udon restaurant
this place is the best in this area
i love udon so much that i find myself eating it about five times a week
this is the first time i ve ever heard of how much you like udon
do you like udon too
i hate these fat noodles that sits in a bowl of this hot broth
i like the refreshing tasting and thin nangmyun noodles
- i see so you like nangmyun
- that doesn t mean that i like all nangmyun
i only like it from this certain restaurant it s number three on their menu
but ever since the grandmother of that place passed away the flavor of the dish changed so i ve quit eating nangmyun
really
had i known sooner i would ve stopped by that nangmyun place
if that deceased grandmother was still there don t you think i could ve found out why the flavor of the dish had changed
if you leave just like this even my chances of ever eating another bowl of nangmyun also disappears
i find that to be unfair too
where s that nangmyun place
i ll stop by before i leave
don t pretend to care when you re just going to leave and abandon me
go on and eat before your fat noodles get fatter
i hope you really enjoy eating it and that you feel a sense of longing whenever you eat another bowl of udon
i come to this place from time to time to get some exercise
i used to be really good at sports i was especially good at tennis
i m good at other thing besides tennis such as horseback riding golf and archery
i guess you would ve concentrated more on being athletic since you couldn t read
i on the other hand only read because i couldn t go outside
that s too bad
we could ve lived together with me reading all the books that you d recommend and with me teaching you all the sports that i m really good at
you re breaking the fundamental structure of give and take when you leave
i guess you re right
i ve always wanted to learn how to horseback ride and how to golf
i have horses golf courses swimming pools and tennis courts
i have them all in other words you could say that i have a lifetime membership to all those things
you even have horses
i saw the ghost of a horse once
but you can t ride the ghost of a horse
president joo
there s an old lady sitting on that bench who likes to mess with couples on their dates
all the couples that sits on that bench ends up breaking up
excuse me
they ll end up breaking up if i just leave them alone
then let them break up
my relationship is about to be broken up as well
i don t want to see others having a happy ending
tae gong shil
don t go
ms tae told me that she was leaving for the sake of her own benefit
that s why i m sure master joo won t be able to force her to stay either
i ve always thought that president joo could do the things for tae gong shil that i never could do for her myself
that s why i ve taken a step back only to stare at her from afar
but if tae gong shil is saying that she herself is what she s really afraid of then the only thing president joo can do is to take a step back and watch her as he waits for her like i ve done
master joo has never once accepted a person s decision for what it is
whether he ll be able to be understand and be considerate of her decision is something that i m not sure he ll be able to do
i didn t even know that jerk was the blabbermouth i ve been searching for i went out to eat chicken gizzards and even lamb hearts with him
hey blabbermouth
this is my bottle
i didn t pour that drink just so you can dump it into that cheap blabbermouth of yours
hey blabbermouth
why aren t you saying anything
why don t you try saying something huh
that cheap mouth of yours is useless unless it s used for gossiping right
hey hey
what what did you just do with that cheap mouth of yours
now that s the only kind of excuse my lips can make
your excuse was a little short
then should i give you a longer explanation
first of all since you can t be the only sober one here start drinking
give us another bottle
it tastes so sweet so sweet
i really like the rooftop of your place
i can now understand why you say that you feel most comfortable up there
it s a perfect place to have a beer
i want to fill up your fridge with beer and i want to come over every day to have one
tae gong shil
how many beers should i get to fill up your fridge
should i buy one beer for tonight or can i fill it up as much as i want
for now just a single pack
six beers
i want to have a beer too while holding your hand
if it s only six beers we can either drink them all tonight or if there are still some left then you can come back another time okay
one pack
any specific kind you like
no i ll figure that out on my own
we ll just start off with a pack
it would be too unfair to just leave without even doing that
one pack
six days
i ve bought myself that much time at least
woo jin
gong shil please help my mom
no i don t want to
i m not going to look at you
gong shil
please help me
i m not going
go away
i said i m not going
where did she go
[ president joo ]
why isn t she answering her phone
miss aren t you going to answer your phone
i wasn t sure what was going to happen so i put a tracking device in gong shil s bag
found it
driver stop the car
woo jin mommy is coming to be with you
ma am
no you can t
please don t do this
let go
please don t do this
don t do this
please calm down
you can t do this
woo jin
woo jin
- you can t do this
it s too dangerous
- i want to go to him
it s okay
woo jin is standing next to her
he came to ask for my help because his mother was in danger
i almost got you killed the last time i followed that kid
but i ended up following him again
even though i stopped her this time she may try doing the same thing again
that s her life
how can you expect yourself to handle all that
i kept being swayed because i continue to see and hear them
even though i really hate it this is just who i am
i can t even handle myself so how can you be expected to handle me
if you go with that man will you then be able to stop seeing the things that you don t want to see
i don t know
but don t you think that i should at least try to find out why i ended up this way
i ll accept your decision
okay
this ends right here
tae gong shil
you and i are nothing but two people who ve only held hands once and shared one single meal together
it means that we ll easily forget one another
i m going to forget you
okay
if you really hate me you can curse me and call me a bitch who left you after bewitching you
no thanks
there s no need to curse out a woman whom i ve only held hands and dined with once
i m leaving
even to the very end she hadn t said that she loves me
it has now been three hundred and seventy five days since the sun gone down in my life
but i haven t collapse and crumble
what should i wear today
- is everything prepared - yes
our sales and revenue must beat out giant mall in the annual sales report
we re preparing some special events for the end of the year sales drive
i ll be leaving for shanghai after this season ends
we need a huge and definitive advantage over giant mall in sales before i leave
- how much
this much - this much
even bigger
this much
once joong won leaves for shanghai next year you ll be taking over his position as the president of this location
the thought of that gives me the butterflies
i have to do whatever i can to make sure that he gets married before he leaves
he sees ms park so hyun with all the frequent meeting with sejin group right
- what do you think of those two
- they only get into hot debates over money
i don t see any possibilities between those two
why don t you try setting up a dinner or something after one of those meetings
you can do that can t you
well yes okay
but from the way i see it it seems to me that president joo is waiting
do you think that it makes any sense that joong won would wait around for anyone
as long as he wants i can get a line of women for him from here to the moon
but
bang shil
what is she a princess from outer space or something
- why would he wait for her
- well you know
i m waiting for the sun to rise again
as a show of your belief that the sun will rise again can you bang the can and spin the lid
thanks
in its own way it comforts me when you bang the can and spin the lid for me
deputy ahn
did you tell him that his meeting with sejin group is at the palace hotel
yes sejin group called this morning to confirm as well
oh no what to do
i needed to coordinate with president joo s schedule and set the meeting up at kingdom but i seemed to have made a mistake
i have to go with him to that meeting
president joo will probably get really upset if we change the schedule
i ll speak to him since i m the one who made the mistake
how in the world did i make such a simple mistake like that
i wonder if i was bewitched by a ghost
we re here way too early for the meeting
there s no way that chief secretary kim would ve made a simple mistake like this i wonder if he s really sick
chief secretary kim
have you been to the hospital yet
you still have to consider your age even if it is just a cold
take the next few days off and rest
you re going to get me sick with your cold
i m going to send over the doctor so just stay home and don t go anywhere what about dinner
i ll send over some of your favorite tuna porridge
no you can t have any ice cream
i m hanging up
i noticed you when you first walked in
if it s okay with you can i join you for a drink
no i m actually waiting for someone
you ve been sitting here by yourself all night
- well yes excuse me
- yes
- would it be okay if i moved my seat - yes go ahead
thank you
this change is nice
has seoul s night skyline always been this pretty
excuse me miss
would you like to have a drink with me
no thanks
please go away
you look so much like someone i know
i said forget it
you re really not going to look at me
i m here with someone
who
a ghost
it is you tae gong shil
the bitch who left me after bewitching me
subtitles by dramafever
i m a unique and special entity in your world
the only way i won t be aggrieved is if you felt like dying without me
but i don t know what to tell you
i just feel slightly disappointed when you re not around
just slightly disappointed
i haven t been waiting around hoping for you to remember me
all i needed to do is show you this and you ll remember who i am
but i purposely kept it and didn t return it to you
you purposely kept it to yourself and didn t return it to me
yes
i thought it would be better for the both of us not to have this
i was planning to throw this away since it was just something that i picked up
here you can have it
you were seriously thinking of throwing it away
yes
so if i hadn t taken it upon myself to remember and recover it you really were planning to toss this away and never to be found again
yes
anyways i ve already thrown it away
then should i throw it away too
since it s yours to begin you can do whatever you want with it
fine
then i ll throw it away too
i ll simply get rid of it
are you in pain
yeah i m in pain
i feel like my back is splitting in half
i thought you ve fully recovered
have you ever been stabbed with a screwdriver
if it had gone any deeper it would ve pierced my heart
does it still hurt
the moment i got my memories back the shock and agonizing pain i felt when i got stabbed came back too
let s get you home
yeah i think i need to go home
take me to the parking garage
i ll go get someone to help you
i got hurt because of you and you can t even help me walk
aren t you being too harsh
okay let s go
you didn t even once visit me at the hospital while i was there did you
why are you disappointed when you don t even remember being there
do you know how much pain i was in
to be honest it still aches whenever i take a breath
yes i m sure that you were in a great deal of pain
is that the best you can say
can t you be a bit more sincere when you say that
yes i m sure that you were in a great deal of pain
right there
that s where it hurts
- you do the driving
- me
then you expect me to drive when i m in this much pain
unlock the door
it ll be dangerous if something jumps out while you re driving
this is for my own safety
just concentrate on driving
i have to concentrate on enduring my pain
start the car
i m sorry han na
i don t think joong won was feeling well he probably went home
i think he went off to see tae gong shil
i guess he still feels drawn to her even though he has no memories of her
she was the woman he cared far enough to risk his own life it s understandable that he would feel this way
did mr joo joong won get hurt in his attempt to save her
- no
- yes that s right
i see
i had no idea that tae gong shil meant that much to mr joo joong won
we look the same but you re not the one that joong won likes
the only thing that joong won knows is that he likes a girl named cha hee joo
i want to tell joong won who i truly am
i m sorry hee joo
i wasn t able to take in my twin nieces that my sister left behind
of the twins han na was adopted and she moved to england and hee joo grew up in an orphanage here in korea
didn t you tell me that i have a twin
i want to go and find my sister
this is the picture they sent me when they met for the first time
i was going to come to korea myself so that i could also meet hee joo but when han na came back to england she told me that hee joo had died in an accident
my little sister is dead
why didn t you look her she was left her all alone there
and i haven t seen han na again since that day
but why do you think that after these past 15 years she s appeared by master joo s side
there s a very high probability that she was the co-conspirator
han na would ve never done something like that
president joo will be shocked when he finds out han na is the late cha hee joo s twin but when he finds out that you re a blood relative of cha hee joo s he will be tremendously shocked
it s even possible that he may misunderstand the nature of your true intentions
you think that all those years that i ve remained by master joo s side would end up in a terrible misunderstanding one in which he may never forgive me
get some rest
i m going to get going now
what would you like to drink
i m going to have a beer and you can have a soda
since i don t have any soda you can have some sparkling water
i thought that you said you were in pain
do you really think that i ve brought you all the way here because of my back pain
you know that wasn t the real reason but you still came with me
okay let s just forget everything that we ve agreed to disregard and start over from scratch and reorganize our thoughts
okay fine
let s talk now since i m here
i understand that you wanted to run away because of your guilt
you probably think this was all your fault for dragging me in but i m also partly to blame because i ran in there without a plan
end of story
we just need to more cautious from now on
i d always anticipated that we ll end things at some point and that made me wanted to keep one foot out the door
but after that near death experience that s when i knew for sure i don t want to end things with you
i m not going to end it
just remain by my side
i ll handle everything
so you ve already decided that s what you want to do
that s right
so when i start to seduce you you just need to fall for me and come to me
drink up
i don t think that i m going to fall for you that easily
to me you are no longer the desperately necessary entity that i needed like before
i m your defensive shield
what happened
did i lose my ability when i got stabbed by the screwdriver
no that s not it
it s just that i m no longer afraid of the ghosts like i used to be
so i no longer need to have a defensive shield
you re still really great and rich and all but that ultimate attractiveness about you that drew me to you is no longer there
you sucked up to me by saying that i was a shield made out of the finest marble in this world when you really needed me
but what am i
you no longer find me attractive because you re not afraid ghosts anymore
yes
it s the same thing as a woman liking a man for his money and the guy loses his attraction to her when he loses his fortune
i ve lowered myself as much as i could go to fit you on your level but you re telling me that that my worth has gone down
then do you want to renegotiate our terms
don t lower yourself to suit me or fall any lower either
i told you that i don t want that
i m going to go now
okay you can go for now
we ll renegotiate once i m done staring at myself in the mirror and find some other appeal that i can offer to you
you do that
you
she says you re not attractive
you ve never heard that before have you
no don t quiver
and don t get angry either
we ll go back and renegotiate
just endure it
unclench your fist
this is no fun
i m unattractive to her
you re quick with your calculations
just name your price
i ll give you whatever you want
you must ve figured out a very precise answer to your calculation
once i pay up tae gong shil s contract with you is over
if you ever drag her into your plans again i ll become the matchmaker this time and marry you off to one of your spirits
but for that to happen it would mean that you d have to die first
i will never block your sun from you again
i ll try talking to madame go
your top priority is their looks
why do you care so much about looks when you re already dead
excuse me
you think that man is perfect
but that man is still alive
what are you thinking
just get lost
i heard that it s going to rain tonight
- are you going on your gt dressed like that
- what s a gt
the ghost training that madame go makes you go on
did you train yourself to not be afraid when you go ghost hunting
- i ve signed a contract with her
- that s all over now
she and i have come to a settlement
there s no need for you to thank me just give me extra points to make up for the points i lost on my attraction scale
ah you settled it with her
that s good
i m sure you ve already heard i signed that contract because i want to bring you back to life
i thought it was great that you were able to wake back up safely but i did feel that it was a little unfair that i got shafted on this
shafted
sacrifice devotion love
it would sound so much better if you had used those kinds of words instead
feelings like that only exist in fairy tales
the wolf and the lamb who meets on that stormy night their feelings for each other are so pure and sweet isn t it
that because it s a children s book
but in reality a wolf and a lamb cannot be together
you re well aware of that yourself
i came back to life from the brink of death i left reality to jump into a fairytale but it sounds like you crawled out of the fairytale into reality during that time
mine was a very cruel fairytale
a dark fairytale where a person dies and come visit the other
it scared me so much i crawled out of that fairytale
you should just go back to your neighborhood now
this is the third time you ve told me to get lost today
which means i ve endured you turning me down three times
don t you remember what you once said to me
sticking around after being told to get lost is something only a mutt would do
it seems to me that you re not taking your own advice
my ears are wide open and i can hear you very well but i don t understand it
grandmother what are you doing here again
we re in the middle of an important conversation
what are you doing
tell them to come back another time
your son is there doing that again
that s very dangerous
okay let s go
where are you going
don t touch me
this isn t the time for your defensive shield
just go home
this is the fourth time she told me to get lost
i m counting the number of times
- grandmother it s okay
- i think it s going to start raining soon
are you really not afraid at all
i can handle it
is your son in a bad state
you re not able to leave in peace because your son is still causing trouble right
what grandmother
tell me what s going on
you can t see the grandmother anyways
so you don t need to know
right
why are you laughing
what is it
what do you care
you can t hear her anyways
yes you re right he is right
- he s a bit
- are you guys talking about me
i don t need to hear to know that you re insulting me right
there he is
mister
mister from the supermarket
mister
mister
i can see him too
how much did he have to drink
mister
mister from the supermarket
grandmother should i wake him up like i did before
national singing competition
i won first place at that competition
yes you did
someone who won first place at a national singing competition can t be lying in the middle of the streets right
it s very dangerous to be there in front of the truck like that
come on let s go
you could ve just explained what was going on to me
if that man was dangerous and if he held a weapon at me would you run to save me again like the last time
what if he had a gun in his hand
would you have taken the bullet for me
i m not going to drag you into situations like that anymore
are you asking me to leave you to face these dangers alone
it s more dangerous when the two of us are together
we don t see or hear the same things
you can grab onto me and not see or hear anything either
how can i live my life clinging onto you like that i have my own world to live in
so you were serious when you told me that you can live without me
you were bewitched because of my persistent clinging
truthfully no other woman in this world would ve come onto you like i did
i came back even after getting pulled away by the hair
i clung onto you even though you ve told me to get lost a 100 times
i m sorry president joo
there s absolutely no reason why you should let me stick around you
that s right
i fell for your spell and lost my mind
you re saying all the right words but i still can t understand any of it
i must ve turned into a street mutt
once you take a step back from me and think about it very carefully you ll come back to your senses
i don t want to hear you telling me to get lost for the fifth time i m going to get going
be careful going home alone
you re still here
what
there s someone who wants to meet me
right now
who
you came
i ve asked joon suk to bring you here so that i could see you
joon suk is the kid who s been asking you to buy coffee every day
gong shil
do you remember who i am
i know you
i m positive that i ve seen you in my dreams
it wasn t just a dream
you were with me during the three long years that you were in a coma
the sun will rise again and i ll be back by your side again
because you re here
meeting you felt like a fresh ray of sunshine
you have no idea how reassuring it feels to know that i have a defensive shield to run there when i m truly scared
master joo are you awake
how can i live the rest of my life clinging onto you like that i have my own world that i need to live in
he s someone who can see and hear the same things that i do
i was the one who discovered you out there in the woods
because your spirit came and told me where you were
during the whole time you were lying in a coma in the hospital your spirit never went back to your body
we stayed together for three whole years
i ve lived as a ghost for three whole years
is that why i m able to see ghosts
i don t know the exact reason for it myself
because i don t know how i came to see them either
where were we during that time
here
you were with me at all the places that i took those pictures
he s telling me that i was there
want to go back to those places
then you will be able to remember those times that you spent with me
there s someone else in this world who can see and hear the same things that i can
i guess you finally realized who i am uncle
i didn t know it was you because you ve changed so much han na
i heard that you went all the way to england to meet with my friends and ask around about me
why did you do that
did something happen between you and hee joo
were you involved in the accident that caused hee joo s death
chief secretary kim
when did you get back
i got my memories back while you were gone
let s you and i talk
i thought i was going to burst because i had absolutely no one to talk to
- come into my office
- master joo
before we do that there s something that you need to hear first
what is it
it s about cha hee joo
- did you find her twin sister
- yes
and those twin girls are my nieces
- chief secretary kim is cha hee joo s uncle
- yes
someone whom we ve suspected to be the twin sister has been found in close proximity to president joo joong won
cha hee joo s older sister
how interesting
you re saying that you suspect me of being the culprit
these are all the postcards you ve sent
yes you re right
those are the postcards that i sent to a friend of mine
you were in every city that i was in
have you been following me around
is that how it looks like
i guess but my uncle was always right by your side
so i can understand how it could ve looked that way
uncle
do you remember the emails you always sent me
although i never responded to any of them
you always wrote about where you were and which place you thought was nice
and the places you went which you thought may be of help in my studies
i listened to him because it was an advice given to me by my only blood relative
yes she s right
i emailed her every month to let her know what i was doing
i was pretty sure she was reading them so i never severed ties with my niece
uncle
although i m a little shocked to hear that hee joo was the culprit you must know there is no reason for me to have been her co-conspirator
han na grew up in a very rich family
there s no reason why she would ve done something like that for money
the han na that i knew was a very kind and bright child
she would never have done something like that
hee joo was always the dark one and she was really greedy too
why did you keep the secret about you being her twin sister why did you hover so close around me
when i met hee joo she told me all about you
that s joo joong won
he came every christmas to the orphanage with his arms laden with gifts
i always thought that he looked like a prince
i ve liked him ever since i was little girl
hee joo told me that she never got the courage to talk to you she always felt too shabby and pathetic
i gave her the courage she needed but that love ended so tragically
i became interested in you because you were someone whom hee joo liked
people always say that twins share a very special bond
i thought that you were showing some interest in me too
then you told me that i wasn t the real thing
how disappointing
that s right
you re a fake
but i ll take what you re saying right now as the real thing
since chief secretary kim is vouching for you
i ll be going back to england soon
isn t the statue of limitation for hee joo s accident ending soon
i was going to give hee joo a proper goodbye when it ends but everything turned into such a mess
i m sorry for not having told you the truth sooner
i came to you because i was curious about the boy who was involved in my niece s death
but i saw that the boy s scar ran very deep
remaining by that boy s side to help him heal his scar seemed to be the only thing i could do for the niece that i had lost
enough
please stop
when you first started i told you that you were a recorder and an interpreter
it seems that i ve opened myself up too much in front of those two things
if you find it burdensome to have me remain by your side i ll stop and leave your side
do that
thanks to you i was able to escape his suspicion
you heard from team leader kang right that i ve been deceitful all this time
i can understand if you ve misinterpreted my intentions
no
i ve seen cha hee joo
hee joo never once glanced in your direction
i hear that you can see spirits
you ve seen dead hee joo s spirit
yes
hee joo told me that she wanted to protect the culprit
if the ghost is willing to protect the culprit then i guess it ll be pretty difficult to catch that person
you don t think han na s the culprit do you
can you catch the culprit
i really don t want to do it but i think i m going to have to grant hee joo her request
are you not suspecting han na because you believe what secretary kim said
no
i m positive that she is the co-conspirator
we just need to find the evidence and catch her
if she goes back to england it ll all be over
she came back on her own accord and she even tried to seduce me
she wouldn t have done that unless she was sure that there was no evidence to be found
so are you just going to give up and watch her walk away
i ve found out everything that i want to know
i wanted to know who the co-conspirator was and i now know who that was
she said she wanted to protect her because han na was her older twin sister
is that going to be the end of it
cha hee joo is dead
no matter how much you hated her don t you think that you should at least try to make an effort to understand why things happened the way it did
if that s what you re going to do then don t do it in front of me
keep doing it behind my back like you did with my father
leave
i ll do that
i ll leave kingdom and do it outside of this place
president joo
i don t want to tell you to get lost too
if you re here to talk about hee joo then don t
i ve got my 10 billion won radar on
i keep getting hee joo on my radar
maybe it was during the moments when i was dead i saw hee joo during those moments
i finished reading that same book while seated in front of her
and then i felt at peace
i was able to read all the words that were written on those pages very easily
then does that mean it s all over
i ve continued to see hee joo
she was always standing next to that woman han na
didn t you tell me that hee joo wanted to protect her co-conspirator it s probably why she remained by her side tell her to keep doing that if she wants
i m not going to get my money back just because i go after her twin sister
it s just going to bring more things to light which i don t want to know about
but still
i just want to end it here
but she was the criminal and i was the victim
i said that i m letting it go and just accept things for what they are
do i need to try to understand when i can t even see or hear her
that s why you shouldn t look at that dead girl any longer either
okay
i m not going to force you to try to understand things that only i can see and hear anymore
you should live your life in peace
this was just something that i wanted to resolve for you
your radar is useless
tae gong shil
in the beginning you hated the things that you could see and hear and you clung onto me as your shield because you wanted to escape from that
but why are you starting to fight me on this why are you trying to see and hear them more and more
when you do that i start to become useless to you
but your life is more peaceful now
the more useless we become to one another the easier our lives will get for the both of us
i fought and found my way back because i thought you couldn t be without me
but i see it was nothing more than a slight disappointment to not have me around
this is unfair
if i continue standing here looking at you i m just going to tell you to get lost from the injustice of it all
you should leave
team leader kang are you really quitting
yes
i heard that chief secretary kim quit too
is that true
yes i think so
thanks for everything
first tae gong shil quits her job then chief secretary kim and now team leader kang
what a mess
then who is to become the team leader now
i ve decided to go to america
okay
- that s good
- but i can t just leave like this
what about it
have dinner with me before i leave
do you know how many reservations i ve canceled because of you
okay
let s go eat
i ll treat
what would you like to eat
i thought you d want to go somewhere that would destroy my paycheck
but this is it
a while back you said you were going to bring me here to eat pickled radishes
so i wanted to check it out and see what the big fuss was about
i took your status into consideration and rented out the whole place
eat as much as you d like
but now that we re here like this it feels a bit weird
but it s simpler this way
let s pretend that we re a couple from high school who met by chance and then parted ways after sharing some ddukbokki simple and fleeting
forget it
just go and get me some more pickled radish
do i look like a high schooler to you
to break up with you so easily
let s cheers
one shot
you have to knock it back like a black whiskered whale okay
okay
this is weird
i feel like i ve been drinking
kang woo
i don t want to break up with you
if i had just told you that i wanted to have a drink you you probably would ve told me that you don t want to right
have i been drinking alcohol
i m not trying to be stubborn
i m just not a very good drinker
don t you find me the least bit pretty
don t i look a bit prettier to you now that you re drunk
yes you re pretty
tae yi ryung is very pretty
there are a few times when i thought to myself wahh you re really pretty when you d show up out of the blue
then why don t you like me when you think i m pretty
because there s someone that i want to protect
she doesn t even know that i ve been protecting her this whole time
do you think that you re tae gong shil s bodyguard or something
yeah
if she d just call out my name just once i will appear out of thin air to stand in front of her
but she won t call my name
that s why i i continue to stand in the sidelines and watch her from afar
i don t want her to feel afraid anymore i want her to feel safe
that s the only way i can stop being her bodyguard
i don t want to protect you
that s why i gave you alcohol
because i want to have you all to myself that s why i m acting like this
where are you saying that you re going to go
here
isn t this another country
are you going abroad
gong ri
there s someone else who s able to see ghosts like i can
- he wants me to go there with him
- there s another person like you
- he really sees the things that you do
- yeah
i don t really remember him but he says he knows me very well
gong ri during those three years that i spent in the hospital he told me that my spirit came and stayed with him during that whole time
do you think gong shil will end up coming with me
if she were to come with me it would make it easier for her to leave that man
you were there from the beginning right
what do you think will happen
he might be more understanding since he can see the same things but do you think that you ll be able to leave the man you love behind
if someone like me who sees and hears useless things remain next to a man who only does what he wants and hears what he wants he won t be able to live his life in peace
you re leaving much quicker than i expected
if i was any later i could ve missed you completely
i thought you were going to let me go did you come to capture me
did you really think that i d just let you go
you said that you believed me in front of my uncle
if i was to capture you as the co-conspirator chief secretary kim who s trying to protect his only niece will be hurt
the secret agent that my father sent to keep an eye on me is quite good so i was thinking of having him turn you over to the police
but i m not going to do that
let s you and i see this thing through right here right now
give me back my necklace
and get lost
you seem to be convinced that i m the culprit
did that woman tae gong shil hear something from hee joo
don t involve that woman in this
do you want to die and be reunited with hee joo
if that s what you want i can arrange for that to happen
that woman must be very special to you
have you completely forgotten about cha hee joo
waiting fifteen long years to see you is proving to be in vain
what was this whole thing
were you trying to approach me again like how you and hee joo tried to do in the past
i guess seduction wasn t your forte
even though you were her twin i ve never once been interested in you
then i ll tell you the truth
joo joong won
cha hee joo isn t the woman that you were in love with
it was her older twin sister
han na
i m leaving
help me
i m sorry
my first love wasn t cha hee joo so it was you
hee joo could only watch you from afar so han na pretended to be hee joo and started talking to you in her place
you re joo joong won right
my name is cha hee joo
han na was a girl who shone brightly as if she had the whole world within her grasp
ultimately she got you
the person that the dark and tragic hee joo had desperately wanted for herself but in the end she lost that too
hee joo ended up getting very angry
that s why she did what she did
i m sorry for all this
joo joong won
hee joo han na
that was something that the two of you planned and did together
cha hee joo did that all on her own
han na would never do something like that
she was an angel
try to remember
the girl whom you were in love with
one of the two ended up dying
you saw it didn t you
you witnessed the moment of her death
but which of the girls do you think is dead
was it han na or hee joo
who are you
- are you cha hee joo
- i told you i m sweet han na
it was that bitch cha hee joo who died
that s the truth you ve known for the past 15 years isn t it
you said that the dead girl was a bitch
it would be too much of a tragedy if it was the nice girl that had died
you re
cha hee joo aren t you
cha hee joo is going to die here
if not then i m going to kill joo joong won
please i need you to die as cha hee joo
i told you that i m the nice and sweet han na
i m the same han na whom you used to be in love with
that s why i ve returned to you
i thought that once i ve returned
you d fall in love with me again
but you already got another woman stuck by your side
no you re not it - you re a fake
- why are you acting like this now
you were too involved in your own scars that you never once tried to find out or understand why that girl ended up dying
if you just keep on believing the truth you ve known you ll be able to live your life in peace
are you saying that she really ended up dying because of me
that s right
she died because of you
i m han na
you don t believe me
even if you don t there s no way you can prove it otherwise
whatever the case
i m sorry for all this
i m sorry for all this
- joo joong won
- joo joong won
cha hee joo
what did you just call me
cha hee joo
it s me hee joo the one and only person who knows that you re the real cha hee joo
it must have been nice for you to be living as han na brown in my place
what do you think that you re doing right now
i borrowed this woman s body because i wanted to talk to you face to face
this is absurd
get away from me
you don t believe me
should i tell you what the last words you said to me
cha hee joo is going to die here
if not i m going to kill joo joong won
please
i need you to die as cha hee joo
i died as you and i allowed you to live as me
why have you come back hee joo
are you really han na
i stole this woman s body so that i could come see you
hee joo should we leave together
cha hee joo stole han na brown s life but i can come back to life again by stealing this woman s life
i died because of you
isn t that right
you can bring me back to life again
help me
we re sisters
okay
let s leave together
just like how cha hee joo has been living as han na brown you can live your life as tae gong shil
i ll help you
and we ll never come near joo joong won again
this is great
because i really didn t like seeing that woman by his side
once that woman disappears
joo joong won will be alone
the rumor about joo joong won being cursed by cha hee joo i ve always liked that rumor
i guess i ll be leaving him behind with another curse
don t run away just because you re afraid that s humiliating
you could ve just stayed away and never come back
you could ve also just left without telling him anything
so why did you tell him everything
did you want to torment joong won
i thought that i could have him if i came back as han na
but he told me that i was a fake
he recognized that you weren t the girl that he was in love with
i know
i m not han na whom he was in love with
what is it
we re in middle of an operation
joong won doesn t know who you really are
i know
because he s never met the real cha hee joo
but my name will forever remain in his heart as his curse
cha hee joo
yes it is you
that s right
since i m the real cha hee joo
han na
i heard that you said you wanted to protect me
let s go han na
i ll protect you
the late han na said she wanted to protect hee joo who s still living
even though she s been unfairly framed and getting shafted on the deal
in other words it s all about sacrifice devotion and love
but even at the end you never realized that cha hee joo
you you re not han na are you
- you dared to deceive me
- you caused han na s death
and you deceived everyone
you did all that didn t you cha hee joo
there s no evidence to support your story
hee joo
you left something besides the girl who lost her life
luckily we still have two days left until the statute of limitation is up
cha hee joo
what i really stole isn t this necklace but it was han na s life
but no one knows that
i m sorry for all this han na
my older twin sister
hee joo
i will remain with you by your side
it s all over tae gong shil
it really is all over
um hee joo
i mean han na says there s one last message that she d like for me to pass along
you have something you d like to say to her too don t you
joong won
i hope that i no longer remain as a source of pain to you
i m sorry
i m sorry for having hated you without knowing the truth
i m sorry
why are you crying
i m crying for you in your place since you re not good at crying
my ten billion won radar
that was a huge thing you just did
let s go
i ll treat you
i m leaving
i feel so much better now that i was able to resolve cha hee joo s case before i leave
it s a relief to know that i wasn t completely useless to you
leave leave to go where
i ve met someone who can see and hear the same things that i do
i told that person that we ll be leaving somewhere together
when you came to see me as a spirit you told me that i shone brightly as the sun
i think that i m a sun that should only shine brightly for those who are dead
i just want to shine brightly and be popular only amongst the ghosts
but when i m with you i feel like i m an unlucky sun who makes people die and it makes me fear and hate myself
so it s not just that you re slightly disappointed when i m not around but i actually make you fear and hate yourself
i don t want to remain by your side only to become that kind of a sun
please tell me to just get lost and out of your life now
the only reason why i was able to tell you to get lost all this time without any fear was because i knew without a doubt that you d come back to me and rise again as the sun in my life
i ll give it a try and do as you wish me to do
get lost my sun
if the sun walks out of my life like this it s going to destroy me
i thought i was seeing things because i was so shocked but tae gong shil it is you
i m shocked too
for a moment i thought i was seeing a ghost
is your radar still on
do you still see ghosts
are you here with a ghost
were you having a drink with your ghost friend
this isn t how i wanted to see you again
there is no ghost i can t see them anymore
- seriously
- yes
so let s stop talking about ghosts
have you been well
for someone who s so curious about how i ve been doing you don t even call and leaves our meeting to mere coincidence
i ve been curious i ve thought of you often
i ve been debating whether or not i should go and pay you a visit
so you ve had the luxury to ponder about coming to see me
i ve been doing well
i ve traveled to quite a few different places overseas
i ve changed
i can see that you ve changed
president joo
has our guests from sejin group arrived
yes ms park so yeon just arrived and her staff members are here now
please apologize to her tell her that i have a very important meeting to take care of
yes sir
- you had an appointment
a huge amount of money rides on this meeting
i can lose a million won for every second that i m missing out on this meeting but i m giving my time to you
is chief secretary kim not with you anymore
he s getting a bit older now so he doesn t come to these outside meetings with me often anymore
sejin group s park seo yeon isn t that the woman that you were briefly engaged to
that s right
she and i ve joined hands and we ll soon open up kingdom s shanghai branch
i bet you ll be making a lot of money while holding her hand
you should be making your money so i guess this is a bad timing right
i m planning to leave for china next month and not to come back for a few months
so this is the perfect timing
although it s nowhere near the scale of what you do i also made some money while i ve been overseas
i ve made enough money to make some investments of my own
i even bought a house in england
i will congratulate you on your earnings since you re bragging about it
but do you really not see them anymore
no i don t see them anymore
so you were relaxing out here and enjoying yourself
yes i do take the opportunity to enjoy a drink once in a while now
that really is something to brag about
i m sorry that i can t join you in a drink since i have a meeting that i need to get to
congratulations on turning your radar off
now that you don t see anything anymore it s okay for you to have a drink right
it s not that you were hesitating whether or not you want a drink you hesitated because you wondered if it s okay for you to be drinking right
no i m fine
i told you that i ve changed
yes it would seem so
i sincerely congratulate you
thank you
didn t you say that time is money
this is bad timing
let s see each other again at a better time
were you even planning on coming to see me at all when the timing was right
yes
i really was thinking about it
i ll be leaving now
she says she s okay now but she wouldn t look at me straight in the eyes
final episode
stop following me
didn t you tell me that you died from drinking too much
so why did you have to pick that moment to beg me to buy you a drink
without having any ghosts involved i wanted to see him again as tae gong shil instead of a ghost detecting radar
but you ruined everything
miss are you okay
should i roll the windows down if your stomach isn t feeling well
mister please take me to mangwoori cemetery
i thought you wanted to go to seodaemun
i have to go to mangwoori cemetery
but i need to stop somewhere and get a shovel on the way
do you know where we could get one
what do you need a shovel for
the tree root keeps poking at me
i m going to chop it off
are you drunk
there s no tree root around here
mister have you ever been buried underground before
oh my gosh
- what
- mister mister pull over and stop the car
tae gong shil screw the timing and just get out of the car
is she your girlfriend
thank goodness
i m not going
you can take this lady to go digging at the mangwoori grave site yourself
let s go to mangwoori
you ve been possessed haven t you
get lost
if you ve been avoiding me because of a ghost then i ll cut you some slack tae gong shil
my sun are you awake
you re probably wondering how badly did i want to sleep with this man that i m dreaming this right
are you disappointed because you d rather have an x-rated dream instead
it doesn t matter to me that the sun has risen already want me to help you out
come here
how did this happen
what am i doing here
you really have changed tae gong shil
it didn t even faze you when you used to find yourself waking up at a mangwoori cemetery now you re asking me how you ended up here
i just asked you how it is that i ended up here
i remember being in the cab
you got yourself drunk last night and almost went to work with a shovel
i followed the cab that you were in
i grabbed you when you got kicked out of the cab for acting like a lunatic
- was i okay
- i wasn t okay
you tried several different ways to seduce me last night
mister i want some ice cream
i want some ice cream
ice cream
i want some more
no you can t have anymore
if you have any more you ll get a tummy ache
it s going to make you sick and you ll get a big belly
no
what are you this time
seeing how you re sitting in that pose i m guessing that you re not a dog
- meow
- meow
i guess the old cat that lives downstairs must ve finally died
get down
look at this kitty
the dog that was here the last time ruined one of my couch cushions
what would you like for me to throw at you
chérie
that s my face lotion it s not alcohol
it s for your face you can t drink that
i feel so lonely tonight
i don t want to be alone
listen here parisian
you re going to disappear the moment i touch you
i can t do what you want me to do for you
it s not easy for me to sleep with you while only holding your hand either
let s just agree on quietly getting some sleep on our own
no
want me to tell you in french
no get lost
i m seriously going to lose my mind
i can only endure so much
by any chance did i get drunk and act all weird again last night
tae gong shil i noticed that you ve developed some new sense of desire since the last time i saw you
it s not like i could ve even done anything when you came onto me so strongly like you did while you were drunk
it was really difficult to just sleep beside you while only holding your hand
so i just acted like a drunk loose woman
you were just drunk
anyone who drinks can end up getting drunk
you were just a drunk tae gong shil last night
that s such a relief
i m sorry
tae gong shil
tae gong shil
i ll go get you some water
president joo i ve missed you
do you still miss your defense shield because you still can see those things
no it s nothing like that
i just really really really missed you so so much
but i can still see ghosts
i wasn t able to find a way to live as a normal human being
is that why you didn t come to see me
i ve been preparing myself to seduce you
i planned on appearing in front of you once i became a really chic normal lady then i ll have you fall head over heels in love with me
and once you ve became completely infatuated with me that s when i was going to tell you that i can still see ghosts
i m already completely infatuated with you does it matter which order that happens
it does matter
i didn t want to see you again as the woman who needs a defense shield
i even made a lot of money because you love them so much
it s all ruined
i m sorry for having been an inconvenience
thanks for the tea
hey loose woman
once you ve spent a night with a man in his home aren t you supposed to give out your number and ask when he ll like to see you again
isn t that the kind of stuff that you re supposed to do
what do you mean that kind of stuff
i m not a loose woman
that s right you were acting too proper
now that you ve become so arrogant
don t be too arrogant and not answer my calls when i call you if you do i m going to tell everyone that you re a loose woman
don t call me
i m going to be the one to call you
that s what i ve decided
well since you hold such an importance to the order of the matter i ll try to be respectful and considerate and go along with your decision
- can i text you
- well sure go ahead
thanks
i m going to get going now
tae gong shil do your best to seduce me
you have all my encouragement
fighting
i must ve been fine even after i drank
yeah i haven t had anything come into my body for a while
what a relief
okay i ll bring him
tae gong shil
where s joong won
i don t think president joo is in any shape to go exercise right now
really
what did joong won say about what happened last night
it s so unlike him to cancel such an important meeting with sejin group
i m not sure but he had a bright smile on his face
don t worry
the way i see it president joo isn t going to go for another woman
it s been almost a year since he last saw bang shil
give him another year without her and he ll forget about her
i think that you ll find president joo with a big wide smile on his face all the time now
smile fighting bang shil could also mean big wide smile
for some reason when you said smile fighting i don t like it
since joong won isn t coming i m not going to go either
i m not feeling so well right now
you re not going
sometimes you make me feel like president joo is more important to you than me
of course he is
joong won is number one and you re number two
we need to have a baby so that i can at least have one person on my side
that was just a joke
we can t have a baby at our age
we don t need anything else but our love
smile
smile smile
i love you
honey
okay gong shil i ll be home right after work
- is tae gong shil back
- why so that you could go around blabbing that cheap mouth of yours again
no since ever i ve been promoted my mouth have become much more refined
you know that
anyways don t go around telling a bunch of people that she s back
because i ll always be on gong shil s side no matter what she decides to do
master joo will go crazy once he finds out that she s back
there s a rumor going around about master joo having a few screws loose ever since his sun tae gong shil left
a few people even witnessed him sitting on a bench talking to himself
gong shil has completely ruined that man
she should take responsibility of him
i want you to take responsibility of me too
why would i
all those countless number of nights all those things that we did and playing with a man like you did like he s your toy
this cheap little mouth of yours
why would you say that out loud
now that your sister is back you ll introduce me to her as your man right
then you can come meet my family and let s get married before winter you need to take responsibility of me
well okay then
when we get married i ll ask team leader kang to officiate oh he s not my team leader anymore i ll just ask kang woo to do it for us
and naturally i ll ask tae yi ryung to sing the celebratory song for us
our wedding will be the bomb and we ll have celebrity statuses
we could be like han-julina or gong-li
you actually think that she ll do it
there s nothing tae yi ryung won t do the moment you mention kang woo s name
i used to hope for things to work out between team leader kang and gong shil but he s now completely head over heels for the little sun isn t he
but once kang woo finds out that tae gong shil is back do you think that his feelings for her will come back and he ll go back to her
that worries me a bit
why would you worry about that
here eat this
it s sweet
just like you
that tae yi ryung she s turned her manager into a paparazzi
look at what we have here
why is this woman being so clingy with the bodyguard
why are all the wives of foreign diplomats so pretty
why did you take those pictures
it s me kang woo
yi ryung s manager
hey dog manners
you should stop working for the diplomats and work for a bunch of old men instead
hey black whiskered whale
are you trying to get rid of every single woman around me
that s right
i still haven t been reassured that i m the only woman in your life
you always pick a desolate place like this to see me whenever i ask you to meet me
of course i d feel nervous and insecure
that s because you re tae yi ryung
this is my way of protecting you
kang woo
did you just say that you re protecting me
you said you re protecting me right
- what
- that means that means that your heart now belongs to me
black whiskered whales are so clueless
it s disappointing that you just noticed now that when you ve had my heart for a while
tell me for sure
if you re serious come with me to see a movie
a movie
- we ve already been to the movies together
- not an empty theater at night
i m talking about going to a film festival
a film festival
i want us to walk down the red carpet together arm in arm like this i want you to come with me to see the movie
that way i can show everyone in this world that you re mine and you belong to me
you re too much for me black whiskered whale
red carpet is overdoing it
it s a road that you need to travel down if you re going to keep protecting me
because i m someone who needs to stand on that road
can t you stand beside me on that road
that s right i forgot that s what it meant to stand beside you
but i don t know if standing on a road that i m not meant to stand on is going to enable me to continue to protect you
come with me please
i told you that you should just come live with me at my house
why do you insist on coming back here
i went around and checked out a bunch of different places before i got this place and this is where i feel the most comfortable
do you still see things
i thought you couldn t see them anymore after your travels with yoo jin woo
no that didn t happen
but i finally know how i ended up being this way
where is he right now
he s still traveling abroad but he ll be back in korea soon
you re not going to leave again are you
no i m going to stay here
- gong ri i m going to buy this building - what
you told me you made some money but you really made that much money while i was in europe
i was staying at this place that was just crawling with ghosts i talked to all the ghosts living there and i got them to leave once they left i fixed up the place and sold it and made a huge profit
why would you come back to live here if you made that kind of money
because i feel the most comfortable here and i think it s a good spot for my studies
and someone once told me that he d give me a chance if i owned this building
is the owner interested in selling
the ownership of that apartment building changed hands this past year
when i made the offer to buy them out they did consent to meeting with you
really
you don t think that they d ask for too much do you
i m not sure
there he is now
- chief secretary kim
- long time no see ms tae
you re looking as bright as ever
- but what are you doing here
- the apartment building that you want i m here as a representative for the owner
then the new owner of that building
that s right i bought that building
it s on a piece of land that k group and l group will be developing together so it s a goldmine of a property
you ignored all the texts i sent you asking you when you were going to call me but you re here wanting to know what the selling price for the building is
so if i want to buy the building you re telling me that i d have to pay you a quite a bit of money
it s just a figure of speech
when are you going to call me
i thought i would be able to pick up the building at the market price value
i m a little short on the money
you re not by any chance thinking of going back abroad to make more money are you
instead of doing that you have the number to the man who owns the building in your phone just give that man a call
if you talk to him sweetly he may lower the price for you
i happen to know that man very well and he s a total softie
i m not going to call you yet
figure out how much more you want for the building and have chief secretary kim call me
i ll be going now
respond to the texts that i sent you okay
when you bought that building didn t you say it was because someone told you that the rooftop of that building was the best in the city
my first reason was to make money off the property
and i thought that once someone returned she d like that place better than having a villa in a place like yangpyung so that was my second reason
so ms tae has not decided on whether she wants to remain by your side yet
no she s made her decision
but she said that the order was all wrong
but respecting her wishes is very difficult
you ve never been very good at following orders have you
i never thought that you were someone who waited around when you wanted something
yes that s how i used to be
is it okay if i go back to being myself
you asked me to advise you
it s okay for you to push her along
bravo
do you have the test result from my checkup
yes
i haven t been feeling very well lately
i m prepared to hear that the results may not be very good but i really hope that it s not a terminal illness or anything
please tell me
madame you re pregnant
you re five weeks along congratulations
i am
i m pregnant at this age
i thought that i was told that i could never get pregnant
but i m pregnant at my age
you re a bit older and you do have a history of miscarrying so you ll have to remain very cautious in order to have this baby
i m not sure if i have the confidence to do all that at my age
the more difficult the pregnancy the more the mother has to be cautious
or what will i lose the baby
i heard that you were at the hospital
were the test result of your checkup not good
no they told me that i m fine
there s nothing wrong
that s such a relief to hear
then we ll still be able to go on our five year anniversary trip
do you have a lot of physical activities planned for the trip
yes of course it should be a lot of fun
we can pilot a small plane and go horseback riding in mongolia
i ve made sure to include all the activities that you love for the whole entire trip
it sounds thrilling and a bit dangerous
what is it
do you not want to go
no
i want to live the rest of my life freely with just the two of us
honey
i love you
all my plans keeps going awry
mister
you re still here
long time no see
have you been well
tae gong shil
mister we weren t talking just now okay
you have to pretend that you never saw me
what is it
want to negotiate the building price
over a shared meal
- i already had my lunch
- really
then we can go pass some time first and have dinner together later
i told my sister that i d have dinner with her tonight
i have a lot of people who want to eat with me too
you know that my aunt is constantly trying to fix me up with women don t you
i ve been swamped with dinner invitations lately
but you re just going to leave me be
so then how many of those dinner invitations have you accepted
this is the first personal question you ve asked
i wonder what i should say for you to react strongly to it
so you have gone on some dinner dates i knew it
you did tell me that you were joining hands with that sejin group woman to go to china together right
it worries you doesn t it
that s why this isn t the time to be worrying about some silly order right now
just forget about your order and just lure me in
call me and i ll come to you
did i tell you anything while i was drunk
that s right
you told me everything that i really liked hearing
i don t care whether that man is sitting there or not
so you knew that i can still see them
yeah
do you still hate yourself for being that way
mister
these ghosts are always interrupting at the most crucial times
why is he acting like that
he s moving
mister where are you going
wait you told me that he never moves from his seat from that bench
yes i did
mister where are you going
i have to get going
that man is my friend
i m coming with you
just as i feared you and i are always surrounded by ghosts and their problems
mister tae gong shil
- it could be the wedding of your dreams
- yes i see it s very nice
it would be nice to get married here
right mom
that must be his wife and daughter
i think they re here to check out the hall for his daughter s wedding
i think you re right
mister have you been unable to leave because you were worried about your family
that s not the reason
it s not
my husband passed away three years ago
it s because of that damned lottery
lottery
he always used to buy lottery tickets using the same numbers all the time
and miraculously his numbers won the grand jackpot
did he die of a heart attack from the excitement of his winning
no he lost his lottery ticket
he said he accidentally threw the ticket away while cleaning out his wallet
he said even though he was really disappointed there was nothing he could do about it
but then he became sick and he was bedridden for several months on top of that he s always had a history of high blood pressure and in the end he passed away
so this is where he threw away his ticket
so that s why he never left this area
he still couldn t get past his disappointment even in his death
he says if he had gotten that money he could ve paid off his daughter s tuition paid for her wedding and his wife wouldn t have suffered so much
i can see why he was so disappointed if he really had won the grand jackpot
your daughter is very beautiful and she seems kind
your wife was bragging about how happy she was to be getting such a nice son-in-law
all the people you love are still able to live happily even without that money
know that they re happy and it s okay for you to leave now
it is very nice but this place is too expensive for us
we can just have the wedding at the venue that lee and i found
but your father always wanted you to get married at the finest venue
but if you and lee are fine with it then i guess it s okay
president joo
allow me to formally introduce myself
my name is joo joong won the president of kingdom mall
oh my i see
your late husband and i shared a very deep friendship
to be more precise he was my savior
- he was
- my father was
as a small token of my gratitude i d like to help with your daughter s wedding
i hope that you ll graciously accept
please book the hall for the date and the time that they d like
as for the flowers and the decor give them the best of everything
as for the dress
- please prepare it for her
- yes sir
take your time and let me know whatever catches your eye
oh my gosh this is all so beautiful
this is so pretty
dad thank you
i still see ghosts
does that mean that the time you were away was meaningless
you told me that you ve changed
you seem to have changed your resolve so what happened
yoo jin woo acted as my guide
i went to visit all the places that i visited when i was just a spirit
i found out that my spirit roamed to all those many different places with him i also met all the spirits that constantly surrounded around him
and when i came back to the living after having roamed around as a spirit i realized that i was still able to see them because of the promise i made
all those spirits were left roaming this earth without any power of their own so i promised each and every one of them that i d relay their message along once i went back to the living
the promises i made to them is what made me shine so brightly to them
even though i feared and hated myself for being able to see them i no longer feel that way
because i promised them that i ll become their brilliant shining sun
i no longer fear or hate myself for keeping my promises to them
you really have changed
i even learned ways on how i can better handle scarier ghosts through jin woo
like holding my breath if i catch their eye and they make a dash for me things like that
he was able to teach me a lot of things because he s been seeing ghosts a lot longer than i have
i wonder if i did a good job being gong shil s guidance
do you think that path she chose was the right one
isn t there anything that you ve realized after seeing gong shil s journey
it s time for you to go back now joon suk
you don t want to go back because you don t want to take the sat right
your whole life is a test
it s not something that can be avoided just because you re trying to avoid it
go back
and you need to find your own path just like gong shil did
tae gong shil you and that photographer only discussed your ghost theories right
you didn t feel attracted to your guide like you did to your defense shield did you
but you went to all those dinner dates that your aunt set up for you i didn t go to any of those dinners
do you know how much i ve had to endure and starve myself because of you
is that right
in that case want to go grab dinner with me sometime
now
i ll call you
hurry up with that phone call of yours
why aren t you calling me after telling me that you re going to seduce me
why are you teasing me like this you expect me to keep enduring this torture
you should go see that ghost friend of yours
why are you talking about a ghost at a crucial time like this
didn t you say that he was a friend of yours
do you want to continue to see him sitting on the bench like that
since he s your friend go to him and try try talking some sense into him tae gong shil
you really have changed
you ve become a master at playing me like a fiddle to fit your whim
call me
- so you ve come back
- yes i m back
are you planning on continuing to toy with him
no i plan to hold onto him tightly and i will stay right by his side
you ve changed tae gong shil
yes
but you ve changed too
no i haven t changed
i still don t like you
that s not what i was referring to
you have another life in your body
you can see things like that too
it s a very delicate life
you have to be very protective of it
don t act like you know what you re talking about
don t tell joong won about it either
i haven t decided what i m going to do about it yet
making that decision to protect something will be a difficult task
and once you ve made the decision no one will know what the result will be either
even after you ve made that difficult decision it s possible that things could become even harder
embracing someone with love doesn t always guarantee happiness
making that decision is that individual s responsibility
are you talking about you and joong won right now or are you talking about me and the baby i have inside of me
i m just talking about one person loving another person
the living person who has to go on living while loving all the hearts of those who hasn t been born yet or who s already left this world has the most difficult task of them all
i will do everything in my power to help with your daughter s wedding so stay till your daughter s wedding and then you should move on
stop regretting over the lottery ticket that you threw away in that trash can
if we re going to be truthful about it it can t be as bad as my situation
if i were to marry sejin group s daughter or any of those other women
that lottery jackpot money
that won t even compare to it
but you don t see me regretting it do you
okay fine
i regret it a tiny bit but i ve thrown aside all my regrets and have moved on from it
because the woman i love is the sun that shines brightly high up in the sky
amazing aren t i
as a show of you agreeing with me and complimenting me on my values can you bang the can and flip the lid
the brilliant light that gleams off that woman you dead people aren t the only ones who can see that
her light also glares brightly in my vision
i want to get married before your daughter does
do you think that i can
so you think that s possible
but the one thing i can guarantee is that if you choose love you ll never feel lonely
one two jump yay
give mommy a kiss
giving a loving glance and sharing a warm meal together and all those other shining moments filled with love and laughter will become your reward for loving someone unconditionally like that
if i lose this baby i probably will never know what that kind of love feels like will i
- boys
- gong shil
- are you guys moving
- yes we re moving to a home that has two separate rooms
really
your mom must ve worked very hard for the two of you
- are you living here again
- yeah
what about your special man
what should i do with that man
should i keep him and live with him
- you can t be without that man
- i don t think he can be without you either
he can t even read
he can read now
but you re right he can t be without me
kang woo
- are you back
- yes i m back
have you come back to see me
no
i promised the boys that i d help them with their move
you can help too sure
since we ve worked hard enough let s have a drink for old time s sake
have you been well
i saw the article about you and yi ryung
being with her is a constant risk of exposing myself to a photo opportunity
i can see how
if you think about it that way even the little sun have to deal with a lot of hardships like that
you have your work cut out for you keeping her safe and protected
she s so pig headed and always does whatever she wants she doesn t make it easy for her guards to protect her
that s why you are absolutely perfect with your guarding skills
tae gong shil
you no longer seem nervous or afraid to me
i drew every ray of light i had within my being and worked very hard to become the brilliant sun that i was meant to be so that i can return and stay at the side of the man that i love
do you remember how we sat here and toasted to you becoming someone amazing
it looks to me that you have worked hard into becoming someone truly amazing
i d like to compliment you on your feat
thank you kang woo
you need to stay strong to protect our famous little sun okay
but i m not sure if i can get up the courage
i have to walk down a red path that i had never even considered before
the thought of it scares me a little
even i who sees ghosts was able to find the courage
i know that you re brave enough
here
thank you
i looked up some more things that we could do during our vacation
bungee jumping sounds a lot of fun
we can jump down a cliff
the wind surfing sounds nice too
how about skydiving - doesn t that sound like fun
- honey
i m thinking about doing something very courageous
skydiving
do you think that you can do it
skydiving piloting a small plane and horseback riding in mongolia i can t do any of that
why not you don t like the thought of going away for our five year anniversary
i have to give birth to our baby
do what
in my fifties after five years of our marriage i found out that i have a five weeks old little fetus in me
- honey
- honey
i m old enough that sometimes i forget about your name from time to time but do you think that i ll be able to handle having this baby
i love you
since i have you by my side i want to try my best for this baby help me
with everything that you have
little cheol suk s mommy
i guess it really was too much for him
kang woo
okay
that frightening red path i ll travel down that path with you
if you get scared you can just hold onto me
i ll hold tightly onto you and so that you ll never get lost
okay
- here it is - thank you
you are now the proud new owner of your very own apartment building
president joo didn t come down on the price at all
but he didn t raise the price on you either
that building really is a gold mine
you can trust me on that
he told me himself that he d give me a chance if i owned the building
so i meet the criteria now right
ms tae
from the very first time i met you when i had to take president joo over to your apartment building i ve always been on your side
if you hadn t stopped the car for me the first night we met i doubt that we would ve been able to make it this far
thank you
watching master joo fall for you has been like watching my own child grow up under the ray of warm sunlight it makes me very happy
even if he continues to talk back act brash or bratty in the future be understanding of him and continue to be there for him okay
hey french lady
are you by any chance still here
can you tell me if you think she ll call me tonight or not
should i keep sitting here enduring this agonizing wait
she s calling
patience
wait until the fifth ring before answering
one
you took your sweet time didn t you
have you been waiting for my call
that s right
were you staring at the phone and willing me to call you
that s right
- i totally fell for your plan
- mr joo joong won
i would like to formally invite you over to my place tonight will you come
- an invitation
- that s right an invitation
and there are some things that i need to tell you
you re going by the book
making plans and giving me a formal invite
then once we make eye contact i m supposed to fall for you right there is that what you re expecting to happen
yes
you know that i ve always been good at formality ever since i started working for you
will you come to me
then i will formally accept your invitation i ll come to you
wait for me
ms tae gong shil
what should i do first first i should shower
shower
put on a little perfume
make this moment exciting and stimulating
tae gong shil fighting
i should change into something more alluring
i disregarded your preference i prepared this moment to be very sweet and special
you seem to be unaware of just how much i ve changed lately i have started to love all the sweet stuff
it s okay
i like it
this building is mine now
a self-made entrepreneur at such a young age
you ve accomplished a huge feat all on your own
the price of the land around here is very expensive
that s very respectable
have a seat
here
wait
there s something that i need to tell you before i can join you in a drink
i have a special ability
is that right
once in a while when i get drunk just every once in a while
i can turn into someone else or i can even become something else
don t get too flustered when that happens but just touch me ever so slightly
i understand completely
and as you may already know i might act strangely and i might say some weird things
when that happens you just need to think of it as me taking a phone call
yes if you receive an important call you should definitely take it i understand
i have my own special world in which you can t see nor hear anything
i can get so immersed in that world and at times i will start to cry and may even get sad from it
even though you may not be able to understand me please just take me for who i am and be understanding
no matter what the relationship no one in this world can ever fully come to understand the other person s world
if i act ignorant because of my lack of understanding just take me for who i am and be understanding
i might make things difficult for you or become an inconvenience to you but i don t want to be sad and lonely without you
i m going to remain at your side
because you re very special to me
i love you
i ll remain forever at your side and love you eternally
my name is tae gong shil
i m your sun
can i rise by your side
is that the main purpose of you inviting me here
then i cannot accept this invitation
because an invitation means that you leave after a brief visit
i have no intentions of doing that
i m going to continue to live forever by your side
i ve never once let you go
because without tae gong shil as the sun in my world my world would crumble and fall apart
thank you for not letting go of me
i know that you re going to go through a lot but i m not quite sure what it is that i can do to help
just remain by my side
once i give birth to a healthy baby you with your youth can raise it
of course
once you pop that baby out you can just leave the rest to me
you okay
now that i m here it s not as scary as i thought it would be
kang woo would it be okay if i kissed you right now
black whiskered whale that s a little
i ll give you one later
you promise
it had better be hot and steamy
there are so many couples here
but how many of them do you think are truly meant to be with one another
i bet we re the only ones i m not sure
i don t know if you re my true soul mate
you don t know
give me your hand
can t you feel how my heart is racing
i m not so sure
we re each other s perfect soul mates can t you feel it yourself
yes you re right
since such an ability doesn t exist i guess most people just walk on by without ever recognizing their soul mates
an ability to recognize your mate even at the slightest touch that would be nice
if that truly existed you ll never let go of that person no matter what you re faced with
just like us
kingdom are you the president of that place
- did you feel that shock
- no
i felt a really strong shock when we just touched
it was really strong wasn t it
it s possible that it was my ability to see the ghosts that enabled me to recognize how special you are to me at a first glance and thus i was to able to grab onto you
it s a very helpful skill
what would we ever have done if you couldn t see ghosts okay
we re all set now
let s move on to the next course
do we really have to go all the way out to the ocean just to see the sun rise
the sun rises all over the earth
even if we are not able to see it but the sun is rising over some land right now
so why we have to go so far just to see it
what the heck
you re the one who asked me to rise as the sun in your life how can you sound so crass about it
don t sound so brazen when you haven t risen in my world for the past year
it s your duty to continue your effort to entice me
entice me right here and right now
i do have something that i ve prepared to help me entice you
okay just one more
this is the end of where i remain patient and follow your lead
from now on i m going to do as i please
the thing is when i was in america i saw steve jobs whom you ve wanted me to meet
are you serious
- did you get to talk to him
- yes
if that man was alive i bet the sun would be rising a little differently
tell me all the details what else
i m not supposed to tell you this
because the future is for the living to create
but i m special
you can just tell me
- no i can t
- fine forget it okay fine
since you re so special
okay the thing is
steve jobs told me
are you serious
and
jobs told you that
you can t tell anyone okay
of course
- and no i can t tell you anymore
- then i m going home
- come on tell me
- no i can t
then should i use force
busier than usual here tonight
this is why we should never leave the house
you said parking meters were why we should never leave the house
and birds
and the wind

mom you re gonna make up some fictitious guy
that s insulting to jackie
can i call him pedro
i think she s okay with it
so what you re gonna keep this lie going the rest of our lives

jackie will meet a great guy who s sweet and kind and who understands that one weekend a year he s pedro
okay you look pretty
handsome handsome handsome
you look happy
what s wrong with you
i m looking forward to seeing your sister
i like eileen
you just like that she takes us out to a fancy diner
i think of her i think of steak
that s more than i can say about most people
i hate how she always chooses a place that s outside of our price range and then insists on paying
i agree
nothing worse than consistent generosity
i know my sister seems nice but you didn t grow up with her
you don t know what she s capable of
it was a brisk autumn s day
please not the rocking horse story again
it was a brisk autumn s day
have fun with your new rocking horses girls
do you like yours eileen
yours is pink
the next morning pinky was dead
we know
we ve heard this story a thousand
the next morning pinky was dead
my dad accidentally backed over her in the driveway
and who put her out there
i ll tell you who
eileen
no
your own sister
sean we hear this story every year
and every year she brings it to life
but killing my horse wasn t enough because ever since then
eileen has devoted her life to one-upping me
mom i m gonna put on my guidance counselor s hat here ugh
not that hat from last year
i wore that one time
swing and a miss
my point is mom every year you tell us this story
have you ever thought of telling your sister how you feel
well let me get this straight
are you saying i should share my feelings
yes
ronny that s crazy
i hope you re not telling students to do things like that
if you keep this buried inside one day it s just gonna boil over
not if you tamp it down hard enough
- way to go ma
- tamp it
you re an inspiration
so eileen ray how was your flight
aw terrific
just terrific
well first class isn t what it used to be it s so much better
laughter
oh we know
we ve flown first class
oh marjorie that s terrific
sure was four years ago we were going to florida
i fell on the tarmac so they had to bump us up
anyway
we were literally dancing in the aisle
really pissed off the stewardesses
- arthur
- sorry
flight attendants
so where s cole
oh he ll be joining us here soon you know i don t know if i mentioned it - but cole came out a few months ago
- mm-hmm - oh great
- good for him
so i guess now you re not the only one with a gay son
well it s not a competition
although it s interesting that ronny came out so much earlier

they never meant anything
that makes it better
better watch out mom and dad are back they know you were gone all night
you sound almost happy about that
- you re okay spencer
- yeah i m fine
ashley isn t feeling too good though
ashley
you were supposed to be with aiden
forget it glenn your stupid plan didn t work
is it too much to ask for a phone call
whether we re here or not we deserve to know where you are and if you re okay
- not to mention you missed church
- i m sorry i spent the night at ashley s
i didn t think you and dad would be back so early
now we know you don t go to mass unless we make you
sorry
spencer
don t you see i m worried about you
ever since we moved here you ve changed
what am i supposed to do
stay the same
- spencer list
- no dad
you know what
glenn goes out every night and nobody says anything
and then i go out to help a friend and get the inquisition
a little double standard don t you think
- it s that girl i ve told you
- here we go again
you know what her name is ashley ashley
why won t you ever say her name
you want me to say her name
i ll say her name
- you are not allowed to see ashley
- what
why
because she s a bad influence
i am telling you you are forbidden to see ashley
how are you gonna stop me
you re never home
paula
what is wrong with you
you re on the edge here
don t you dare make this about me
this is about our daughter
and this relationship she s having with that ashley
don t you see you re letting it drive a wedge between you and spencer
really
maybe i should go away and you ll deal with it cause you obviously know best
you do what you have to do
i m sick and tired of following you and not really knowing why
- what are you doing
- i m checking your lifeline
i wanna know if you re gonna be around for a while
get a room
since when did this become the island of lesbos
it s hard to get pissed when she makes a geography joke
i wonder if she even knows what it means
i know her evil minions don t
you know you re right
we re gonna be late for class
i m glad your folks were fighting
cause i mean it normals them up
my mom loves a good fight with my dad
she says it s all about the make up sex
thanks for the image
now i ll never be able to have dinner at your house
i called her
my mom
i spoke to her
you think i should go see her
only if you need to
with no expectations on who or how she ll be
i don t want you to get hurt
maybe i ll learn something maybe when she sees me she ll want to know about me
maybe you need to tell her that you are a wonderful talented smart black man that forgives her
i know it ll help you whether it changes her or not
duke that s who that was and they are talking of a full ride
all i have to do is stay healthy and keep putting the ball in the hoop

right
- maybe you can come with me
- i would love that
but i don t know about moving out there just to be with you
unless we are married
married
i think i should probably just be focusing on playing ball and school right now
i would never pressure you i mean this is an opportunity of a lifetime
i just think we should be honest on how this is gonna affect us
if there is an us
hey we don t have to figure this out today
why don t you drive me home and we ll celebrate
my mom s out of the house
i wish my parents weren t acting like complete freaks
suspicious controlling

thank god you ve come sir
thank god
i was seasick- -
call up mr tildon - - and send to the stock exchange for mark turner
mr turner hasn t been on the floor today
mark turner is responsible for this raid sir
because he s a cheat - i found out he was responsible for that henrietta girl and put the blame on mr bertie -
i m sorry to hurry you - - but it s two-thirty and your securities must be in the bank before the market closes
it s almost three o clock
there s nothing on earth i can do
you re too late
flint s on the floor now knocking the last breath out of the henrietta - - and i can buy your holdings for next to nothing
get the police
all the police in the world can t prevent your losing control of the henrietta mine when the gong rings in the stock exchange
sir you re insulting me
- - and i demand that you stop yelling that woman s name
they re all yelling that woman s name at me - and i can t make them stop
bertie listen
- - i ll tell you something that will stop them
every time you hear a man yelling henrietta you grab him and say - - i take it
it seems to bertie that the whole stock exchange is taunting him by yelling henrietta s name
she s up forty points and going like a rocket
van alstyne s henrietta pounded to a pulp
i ve been saved flint
- - saved by a miracle
it was no miracle - - it was bertie
he s the latest member of the stock exchange
he s bought a cottage on long island - - this is his address
i have been on the floor of the stock exchange
why my boy - - you ve saved henrietta
i mean the henrietta mine

the phantom carriage
a tale told in moving pictures under the direction of victor sjÖstrÖm
at the camera
- j julius
once there was a poor salvation army sister at death s door
she d been stricken with galloping consumption and had only held out for the space of a year
when there was no hope left she d gone home to her mother
waiting at the foot of her bed was another salvation army sister who had worked alongside the sick girl
don t fret over those poor souls now sister edit
you ve done enough for them
send for david holm
please don t
my daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life
now that she s dying let me have her to myself
sister maria why don t you do as i ask
send for david holm
i shall go find him at once
you can t be serious asking david holm to attend to a dying person
i wasn t able to find him but gustavsson is looking too
he ll bring him here if it s at all possible
poor mrs holm
03 p
it wouldn t do for her husband to see her if he should come here
the evening on which these events took place was no ordinary evening it was new year s eve
well we ll certainly know when it s time to toast the new year
it s a spooky place to wait for midnight here among the dead
you gentlemen aren t afraid of ghosts i hope
then i d like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour
i once had a pal named georges who was generally a jolly fellow
he came from a good family and had studied at uppsala university so he knew a bit more than the rest of us
but a change would come over him on new year s eve
remember that it s new year s eve the last day of the year
whoever dies on this eve must drive death s carriage
there is an old old carriage
it is no ordinary driver who holds the reins for he s in the service of a strict master named death
for him a single night is as long as 100 years on earth
night and day he must carry out his master s business
end of part 1
the phantom carriage part 2
wherever he goes he s greeted with sorrow and despair
there is no escape
he must perform his forlorn duty
though horse and carriage are always the same the driver is not
the last soul to die each year - the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight - is destined to be death s driver for the following year
now you know why i m afraid of something fatal happening to me on new year s eve
and the odd thing is you see that georges apparently died last new year s eve
why hasn t gustavsson arrived with david holm
come with me david holm
sister edit is dying and she has asked for you
if sister edit wants to see you you must go to her at once
david i can t believe it s you
it is you who is to relieve me
you should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can
no living soul rides in that carriage
by the time i arrive it s too late for a doctor
you know full well that i am no longer among the living
but worst of all you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime
david do you think i m unaware that it s my fault you ve met such an end
if you hadn t fallen in with me you d have led a good life with your wife children and brother
by tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior
but before you leave a harsher punishment awaits you
behold your brother
while you were here he killed a man while intoxicated and now a long prison term awaits
but we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer
does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways david holm
yes
only now do i realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one
what about your wife and children
now i know how miserable they ve been but i will turn over a new leaf they need never despair of me again
end of part 2
the phantom carriage part 3
no she s not ill
she was well enough the other day when she left
and here i thought i d come home to her with such joy
if she had gone openly i would have understood
but to slink off like that to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless
i ll wipe those smiles off your faces
i ll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core like mine has now
i ll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger
i will take you to a time a year ago to last new year s eve when you came to this town bringing such misfortune in your wake
a salvation army station had been set up here in town and it was ready for use on new year s eve
keep your food
i just want to sleep
leave it alone
it may be full of germs and our sterilizing oven isn t working yet
don t you realize maria how happy i am to help the first guest god has sent us
please go to bed
it s been a busy day
let me attend to this
dear jesus let our first guest be blessed with a happy year
all night long she bent over the coat never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled
by the time she went to bed the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room
was it you who mended my coat
would you mind calling the person who did this
it s a shame you went to all that trouble miss but i m used to having it like this
before you leave i d like to ask you to visit me again next new year s eve
you see i prayed that our first guest would have a good year and i d like to know if my prayer was answered
oh i ll be here
i ll come show you god didn t give a fig for you or your twaddle
the time has come to honor that promise before you take over here
from you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed and now she awaits your visit
you possessed all that is most wonderful but you lost it
you cannot avoid the torment of remorse just as you cannot escape taking over as death s driver for a year
captive come forth from thy prison
ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight thou wilt relieve me of my office
for a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm
end of part 3
the phantom carriage part 4
it is death but he has come too soon
you see that i m not afraid of you
i will gladly heed your summons but grant me a day s reprieve for there is someone i must talk sense into
you do not know what terrible misfortune i have caused
i cannot approach the lord until i have set it right
the person i m waiting for is the man i love
do you understand
the man i love
i would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you
but you have no power over this man
believing he was good you ve tried to make him mend his ways but your hopes have been dashed time and time again
it was you who enticed him away from his home and work
you made him the drunkard he is
don t let yourself be dragged under
salvation army rally
run along and be saved and i ll be sure to come watch
why turn away so carefully
i m a consumptive myself but i cough in people s faces in hopes of finishing them off
why should they be better off than us
he s merely amusing himself
he s not as wicked as he pretends to be
how can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man
you needn t worry about that i ll be leaving town in a few days
no you mustn t do that
i would rather you stayed so i may challenge you again
tempting as that may be i still can t stay
you see little missy i m on a journey throughout sweden in search of someone i must find at all costs
who is this person you seek
you ll know that when i find the person in question
i am the one david holm is looking for
i am his wife
i couldn t endure the life he was leading
i deserted him
i took my children and crept away in secret
i moved to this town for it was so far from our old home that i never expected him to come looking for me here
you must take him back
it s his only hope
i didn t mean you must make up your mind on the spot
only promise you ll listen to your heart and let us talk again later
she had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world
just come with me
a surprise awaits that will make you happy
end of part 4
the phantom carriage part 5
she hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns
and she may well have succeeded had it not been for
the doctor says it s pneumonia
and her resistance is poor for she s been in ill health since last new year s eve
yes that david holm has been her undoing
she worries so about the situation between him and his wife but she mustn t know the truth
you might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children
it wasn t so easy to run away this time
haven t you had your fill of revenge david
if only i hadn t brought them together again
his sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me
you must grant me a reprieve
i cannot die yet
i must see him turn over a new leaf
just spare me a few minutes
you know i love him
i ve never loved him as i do today
captive ye of loving head come forth from thy prison
come along
we have no business here
those who are to receive her will arrive shortly
you know david if i could send a message to mankind
i would like to send them a new year s greeting
i would like them to dwell on a single new year s prayer
lord please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped
why are we here
surely no one here is going to die
no i can t go on
i can t go on
i m sorry but i must go away and i cannot leave them behind
please don t be angry with me
it s not my fault
this will do david
it will suffice for the children and myself
yes david i see what s coming
i m obliged to watch
i will not shirk my duty
you mustn t let this happen this mustn t come to pass
don t let those poor innocent creatures die
i have no power over the living
where should i turn
should i pray to god or to christ
who can tell me where to direct my plea
i m a poor miserable sinner and i beseech the lord of life and death
i m not worthy i ve broken your every commandment
condemn me to eternal darkness
let nothing remain of me
do what you will to me my lord but spare the three of them
david i see that i no longer need grieve for you
sister edit is dead i was at her side
you re lying
no one believes i want to reform
it s hard to believe david
i can t help crying too
lord please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped

the verdict
as the accused and his already punished companions are found guilty having been accused of many felonies arson robbery and even murder he is sentenced to death
so as to warn others the punishment differs from others and jánošík is sentenced to be hung by his left rib on a hook and quartered after his death
let the sentence be carried out without delay
such was the death of jánošík the first fighter for freedom of the slovak people
thank you shepherd
take care
the end
our story deals with one of those queer tricks that fate sometimes plays
nobody would believe for instance that the entire lives of a peaceful american boy and girl could be changed by a funny little war between two small countries far across the sea the spies of the two little nations were at a pacific seaport each trying to prevent the other getting ships and supplies and yet it came to pass
gentlemen the enemy have just purchased the steamship navigator
there she lies now and it is our patriotic duty to destroy that ship
we will send her adrift in the fog tonight before the new crew goes aboard - - the wind - the tide - and the rocks will do the rest
the wealthy ship owner who has just sold the navigator actor fredrick vroom
and his daughter
actress
kathryn maguire
- heir to the treadway fortune - a living proof that every family tree must have its sap
actor buster keaton
i think i ll get married
today
we ll sail for honolulu tomorrow on our honey-moon - get two tickets
he had completed all arrangements - - except to notify the girl
will you marry me
certainly not
i think a long walk would do me good
your tickets sir - - and congratulations
the boat sails at ten in the morning sir
i don t get up that early - so i ll go aboard tonight
going on a honeymoon without a bride is like singing the words of kiss me again to the music of alice where art thou
i must get some papers off the navigator so stop at pier 12
is there any one on board
under the cover of darkness the foreign agents prepared to carry out their plans
the next morning found the navigator drifting helplessly at sea
will you marry me
this is a fine time to ask me that
i m cold and hungry and - -
put up that bright one
she s quarantined
try and catch them
hey
wait a minute
by the time they were ready to say good-night they had found a couple of sea-going tuxedos
asleep in the deep - wilfred glenn
danger is near thee -
many brave hearts are asleep in the deep -
beware
weeks later - still drifting
we now find the crew with a safe and quiet place to sleep
land
cannibals
we re safer on the boat
we re drifting toward them
we re safe i ve anchored the ship
we are sinking
it s just a matter of time until we re captured
can t you fix it

canto iii
how king attilla besieged rome and how kriemhild summoned her brothers
lord attilla swore to turn rome s churches into horse stables
why does he not fulfill his oath
we went into war
why don t we ride on
why is attilla s horse tethered to his tent
and when king attilla his mount bestrode it was the world over which he rode and when he paused his whip to crack the world cried out - woe woe alack what deeds are now in his mind
what is in the mind of our king
he sleeps
he sleeps
lord attilla attilla sleeps
the white woman stole and bound our lord

the white woman stole and bound our lord

if you would honor me and gladden my heart then bid my brothers as guests to your court
leave for worms blaodel to invite the royal brothers of my wife as guests to our court
here ends the third canto
canto iv
how kriemhild receives her brothers
for over a month your brothers stayed as guests of ruediger von bechlarn
the minstrels sing a new song about the love between your brother giselher and ruediger s only child the beautiful dietlind
thus bechlam and burgundy are bound together one heart one life one death
to honor your brothers lord attilla has sent the noblest of his knights dietrich von bern to greet them
once more dear nibelungen before lord attilla comes to greet you
do not forget to whom attilla will lead you
how could we forget lord that we come to visit our sister kriemhild
whoever wants to win my gratitude must remember my great sorrow
on the day before summer solstice the nibelungen arrived at attilla s court
you must be tired from your journey
refresh yourselves and rest
tomorrow we will celebrate the summer solstice in a very special way
king attilla remember your oath
he who murdered siegfried is now in your hands
remember my suffering
can you never forget lord siegfried woman
hagen tronje shall duel with me for his life
you would fight an assassin attilla
no have him killed
my guest
remember you oath attilla
on the life of your child redeem it
in the desert where i was born there is but one thing sacred the guest
hagen tronje shall be sacred as long as he respects the peace of my abode
she said
whoever wants to win my gratitude should remember my great sorrow
whoever brings me tronje s head will win a shield full of gold
but i beseech you do not harm the sons of my mother
bard play on
here ends the fourth canto
canto v
how the huns celebrated the summer solstice with the nibelungen
is it the fashion at worms to sit at table armed head to toe
lord hagen tronje knows well why he never lays aside his sword
methinks from such a feast the heir to king attilla s crowns should not be absent
methinks the boy has not long to live
we scarcely shall go as guests to any courts of his
treason
the child
the work of your guest king attilla
now you nibelungen all of my men will be against you
safe conduct from these halls i demand for me and my following
here ends the fifth canto

huns avenge your dead

sister
sister
think of our mother
hand over the assassin of siegfried and you are free
the fight is too uneven
the dawn will see no nibelung alive

blood cries for blood
call ruediger
now the time has come lord ruediger
redeem your oath
margrave ruediger i demand from you the assassin of siegfried
not against hagen tronje do you send me queen but against your brothers who defend him with their lives

here ends the sixth canto
canto vii
the nibelungen s end
lord ruediger stands before the gate
he will bring peace
what are you bringing us father
death
o lord do not allow that they who love kill one another
tell them that if they deliver the murderer of my child they may go free
king attilla you do not know the loyal german soul
my oath to kriemhild is older than my oath to you
don t force me to break my oath
fight
do you want me to lose my honor
- defend yourself hagen tronje
o sister what have you wrought
deliver tronje to me and you are free
rejoice in your revenge kriemhild
dead are your young brothers
ruediger is dead
dead are all his men
but hagen tronje who slew siegfried still lives
throw fire into the hall
o lord fiery arrows are raining on the hall by the queen s order - the palace is burning
lady kriemhild is right more than right
i myself will stand at her side when the fire will flush out hagen the murderer
thank you kriemhild
although we were never one in love we are at last united in hate
never king attilla has my heart been as filled with love as it is at this moment
i wish to spare king gunther death in the flames
i shall offer lady kriemhild my head
speak you nibelungen
will you buy your freedom with hagen tronje s head
loyalty which iron could not break will not melt in fire hagen tronje
look
volker prepares his violin for a last song
i call it a shame lady kriemhild that you let heroes who could not be beaten in battle perish in fire s fury
do you hear
volker is singing
ah if only we were on the green fresh banks of the rhine
do you hear
volker is singing
are you not human lady kriemhild
no i died when siegfried died
it is finished
it is finished
lord attilla there still lives one vassal
i cannot go home to my dead siegfried until every wrong has been atoned
lord hagen here is the sword
where is the treasure
i swore not to betray the location of the treasure as long as one of my kings is alive
now kriemhild nobody knows about the treasure but god and me and god is no more discreet than i
now earth drink your fill
take kriemhild home to siegfried her dead husband for she was his and never belonged to another man

siegfried canto i
how siegfried slayed the dragon
thus spoke mime the artful blacksmith siegfried son of king siegmund ride home to xanten
even i cannot teach you any more
have you never before heard of the king s castle at worms on the rhine and the kings of burgundy who reign there
i shall go there to win kriemhild
show me the way to worms or you will lose your life
farewell siegfried son of king siegmund
you will never get to worms
young siegfried understood the bird s song
if the dragon slayer would bathe in the dragon s blood his body would become invincible forever safe against sword and spear
here ends the first canto
canto ii
now volker the bard sang of siegfried in front of kriemhild and how siegfried came to worms
the violin sounded and volker sang
the dragon slayer the son of siegmund entered the realm of the nibelungen
he won the fight against the dragon
there is no one on earth like him
thus spoke alberich the nibelung
spare my life and i will give you the wonder cap
whoever wears it becomes unseen or may take whatever form he chooses
spare my life o hero and i will make you the richest king on earth
the crown of the king of the northland the ruler of the ice giants is being wrought here by the nibelungen
no sword on earth compares with balmung
the nibelungen forged it in fire of blood
all is lost
cursed be the heritage of the heir
return with me to stone all ye whom from stone were wrought
the violin sounded and volker sang
siegfried became the dragon slayer the lord of the nibelungen treasure
twelve kingdoms subdued the powerful
twelve kings became his vassals
kriemhild the daughter of ute volker take this cloak as reward for your song
i embroidered it myself
siegfried son of king sigmund is outside the castle door with twelve of his knights and asks for an audience with king gunther
thus spake hagen tronje
king gunther let the dragon slayer go his ways don t welcome him here
no one shall say that at worms one does not know the way kings greet each other
siegfried son of king siegmund has my welcome
i dreamt last night an awful dream and now this dream comes to my mind
i come king gunther to ask for your sister kriemhild s hand
king gunther too has marriage plans
he has set his heart on a bold and mighty maiden
her name is brunhild and she is queen of iceland
ringed by fire her invincible castle towers in the northland
why must you speak of brunhild
you know she has set dangerous conditions
thrice must the suitor best her in feats of strength or die
siegfried the unique hero has come to worms at an opportune moment
he may help us win brunhild for you
twelve kings have i for vassals but vassal am i to no man now and ever
prepare for the quest to get your bride king gunther
it is siegfried the mighty hero who will win brunhild for you
here ends the second canto
canto iii
how siegfried won brunhild for gunther
the dragon ship is carrying foreign heroes to your shores
the foreigners are nearing the flaming sea
if he be strong enough and favored by the gods the flames will consume themselves and die
my maidens help me put on my armor this will be a a fight i ve never fought before
welcome hero for the fight for life or death
neither life nor death do i desire from you brunhild
it is king gunther who woos you
before it is evening king gunther your smothered weapons will adorn my hall
give me leave king gunther to make ready your ship for your royal bride
we should set sail for home before sundown
let the triple battle begin king gunther
you have to defeat me three times o king with the stone the spring and the spear
fear not o king
make you the motions and my strength will win each contest
i ll throw the stone for you and carry you in the jump
here ends the third canto
canto iv
how brunhild enters worms and how the kings celebrated their wedding
start the prepartions for marriage
the king s ship is arriving
we have reached our destination my queen
are you really the man who defeated me threefold
i am your captive but i shall never be your wife
keep your word king gunther as i have kept mine
if kriemhild gives her consent o hero we shall celebrate a double wedding here today
since when is it customary among burgundians to give the king s daughter in marriage to a vassal
siegfried is no vassal
i love him as though he were my brother
we shall become blood brothers today
blood is mingling with red blood the drops fuse inseparably
whoever forsakes loyalty to the bloodbrother will perish at the wayside all honor is lost
brunhild has been defeated not cowed
shall the king of burgundy be scorned by an obstinate woman
damned be the deed half done
will you forsake your friend who gave you his own sister
the magic cap will change you into what you wish
take gunther s form and break brunhild s iron will
here ends the fourth canto
canto v
how after half a year siegfried s gift to his bride the nibelungen treasure arrives in worms and how the two queens quarrel with each other
o king burgundy s glory is waning we need the nibelungen treasure
it would be folly to reject what siegfried offers you as a brother and kriemhild is worth more than all the gold in the world
see what i found
put away the armlet kriemhild it guards an ugly secret
the mistress of the nibelungen treasure has no need for it
listen kriemhild at how i won the armlet - and keep silent
the nibelungen treasure has arrived
how long king gunther will siegfried and kriemhild tarry at the court of burgundy
they stay for the sake of my mother
would you brunhild be willing to take up the daughter s place for queen ute
your brother s honor is entwined with this armlet
it never should be seen again by human eyes
it seems to me high time king gunther that you send siegfried back home to xanten
never
he shall leave of his own freewill
i am going to attend mass my daughter
follow me soon
i ll go to the cathedral in the regalia of the queen of burgundy
the wife of a vassal may not precede the queen of burgundy
how did you dare refer to siegfried my husband
siegfried introduced himself to me as gunther s vassal and servant
he did servant s work for my husband
you whom he disdained
you whom he gave away
you dare to belittle siegfried
make way for the queen of burgundy vassal woman
you recognize this armlet you queen of burgundy
how came that armlet into your hand
the carrier of the magic helmet who disguised as gunther defeated you three times
- siegfried my husband gave it to me
king
speaks your sister the truth
kill siegfried
kill siegfried
your babbling hero was worse than murder
kill siegfried
siegfried is safe from your wrath
none can slay the dragon slayer
save in one spot where the linden leaf clung is he vulnerable as other men
king gunther let me deal with the dragon slayer
we pledged blood brotherhood
how can i be party to his death
the one who took the armlet from me made me his wife took my maidenhood from me
tronje announce to the people of burgundy that i invite everybody to a royal hunt to kill a mad dog and a ravening
here ends the fifth canto
canto vi
how gunther betrayed siegfried
can you keep a secret kriemhild
i once broke the oath to be silent and never will do so again
well then the upcoming hunt might easily turn into a chase for men
a secret message warns me of war against burgundy
good for you kriemhild that your husband is the dragon slayer the invincible
who warrants me that in the heat of battle not a chance blade should pierce where the lime leaf fell
if you want me to protect him i have to know the exact spot where the invicible could be hurt
you are good counsel you truest of true
i shall mark the spot with a little cross myself
i come to take leave brunhild
we are starting for the hunt in the odenwald forest
mind my vow king gunther i shall not eat nor drink until my disgrace has been vindicated
o my dear lord don t leave me
i dreamt last night a furious boar tore you to pieces
o my dear lord don t leave me
i dreamt further that two mountains collapsed and buried you
today gunther and i will reconcile
who else is my enemy
mother i feel as if blood is draining from my heart
the hunt in the odenwald forest lasted from morning until sundown
a handful of red gold for a cooling draught of white wine
a wheel broke from the wagon loaded with wine
but i know of a cool brook nearby
i always heard of you as the fastest runner of all heroes let s run you and i for the first draught
gunther my brother let s be friends again
when you are back from the spring
grim hagen spoke
the hunt is over
here ends the sixth canto
canto vii
how kriemhild swears revenge to hagen tronje
you may break your fast brumhild siegfried is dead
hail to you king gunther
for the sake of a woman s lie you have slain your most loyal friend
i call to you for justice king gunther
hagen tronje has slain my husband
loyalty for loyalty kriemhild
his deed is ours
his fate is ours
our breast is his shield
you might try to hide among my clan behind the altars of god or at the end of the world
- you cannot escape my vengeance hagen tronje
announce to king gunther my brother the queen of burgundy is dead
thus ends the tale of siegfried
the hands of orlac

i will hold you in my arms my hands will run over your hair

vasseur denied the act but the fingerprints which were found gave the real evidence
the dagger which was stuck into the heart of the old racketeer bore the same x mark on the handle

paul orlac
these fingerprints which are clearly visible are the fingerprints of vasseur and who has those fingers now - you paul orlac
the letter which passed through all the servants in the house was written by the hand of vasseur and this hand is now - your hand
the dagger with which the murder was done is vasseur s dagger with the x
your maid will swear that she saw you with it - in your hand
perhaps you did not do the murder - but you cannot deny
what is happening to me

i have the feeling that these hands are drawing me to crime
i must bring him the money
you will tell the state prosecutor everything

he was then executed i have seen with my own eyes the work of the guillotine on a neck
mr orlac we thank you for your evidence
go this evening bring the money with you to the stranger
and we will follow you
someone well known to us
- mr nera at last assistant to professor serral one of the least talented crooks in the world
i am also a blackmailer
but you are searching for the murderer
haven t you considered that the murderer has vasseur s hands i don t have those hands haven t you considered that the murderer has vasseur s hands
i don t have those hands
i can tell you who has those hands
mr orlac i arrest you
mr orlac is not guilty
- nera is the murderer
keep silent
explain the fingerprints of the executed vasseur
nera was vasseur s friend he secretly made imprints of vasseur s fingerprints and then he had rubber gloves made with vasseur s fingerprints
and so he killed the elder orlac
if vasseur was not guilty then my hands are pure

the end subtitle by reza fa
in the great gold rush alaska was the hope and dream of men the ruthless siren of the far north beckoning thousands to her icy bosom beckoning thousands to her unknown regions
chilkoot pass was the great barrier to the gold fields
over this pass men faced untold misery and hardship
many lost their lives some fell by the wayside others lost courage and turned back but the brave went on
far into the icy north deep into the silent nowhere came an undaunted lone prospector
and somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector
with cheerful optimism our little columbus descended then stopped stepped slipped and slid
now let me see thought the little fellow
before i know where i am i must get there
there in that frozen wilderness a dream came true and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky
eureka
i ve found it a mountain of gold
but the elements laughed roared and thundered
in that raging nowhere was a lone cabin and another lone man black larson an unmitigated predatory scoundrel
out of the lashing storm came the little fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality
there he sat resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole
come here said larson
what are you doing
eating obviously
get out
go on
get out
the wind also was giving big jim his troubles
big jim was the noble type he had suffered
oh how he loved to suffer he suffered about everything
get out said black larson
or i ll fill you both full of lead
now then the pair of you get out
out
that kind of noise jim don t tolerate
i ll stay right here understand
right here said big jim
yes sir he ll stay right here said the little fellow
understand
we stay right here
and stay they did for days and nights
the cabin moaned and groaned
two men walked and never talked hunger gnawed their bones
i must have food yelled big jim
i must have food
what are you eating said black larson
nothing
open your mouth
liar it s that candle
that said the little fellow how revolting
if i thought you were holding out on me i d slit your gizzard
one of us must brave that storm if we re to get food
come here the pair of you
we ll cut the cards and the low man goes
you re the man said jim
goodbye good luck
don t forget to bring home the bacon
somewhere in that nowhere the law was looking for black larson
desperate with hunger and here it was thanksgiving day
nevertheless there was something to be thankful for
not quite done yet give it two more minutes
come on come on said big jim
after scouring the country for food the little fellow had to admit he had seen nothing not even a field mouse
from the pangs of hunger
big jim was becoming delirious hysterical
in fact he was a pain in the neck
food food he thundered
i can put another shoe in the pot
no no anything but that
poor jim he couldn t take it
what s the matter said the little fellow
i thought you were a chicken
well build up the fire said big jim
what s the matter with you said the little fellow
come my pretty bird said big jim
don t be childish
hey quit it
don t be foolish it s me
you said jim
i m sorry
i must be crazy
you re telling me said the little fellow
you go inside i ll take the gun in case you lose it
chicken or no chicken the little fellow looks appetizing to big jim
meanwhile black larson stumbled onto big jim s mountain of gold
then came the parting of the ways
big jim to his mine our hero to his fate
goodbye said the little fellow
it s been a great pleasure knowing you
treachery awaited big jim at his mountain of gold
big jim looked deep into the eyes of black larson and saw there the soul of a skunk
caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds black larson swept on to impending doom
and out of a dream in that frozen waste a city grew and humanity warmed it with living loving and desiring
georgia
jack was a ladies man
georgia was quick and impulsive proud and independent
in the evening georgia worked as a dancehall girl
jack had lots of appeal for georgia perhaps that s why she resented him
out of the night came the little fellow towards the dancehall that beacon light of pleasure that retreat of lost dreams
georgia why aren t you nice to jack
i believe he really likes you said the girl
he likes everybody said georgia quite audibly
i m bored with this place she continued
i d give it all up if i could find someone honest and worthwhile
don t worry i ll find him someday
then she turned and looked and looked and looked
kinda fresh ain t ya thought jack
get down off that high horse
me and you are gonna dance
hey there pan out a tune
just a moment i said we re gonna dance
i beg your pardon said georgia
to show her utter contempt for jack she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall
hey you come here
yes you
do you want to dance
you see i m very particular about whom i dance with
and there he stood the dauntless cavalier guarding her sanctuary
if you wanna make a hit with your lady friend
you should put your hat on straight like this
take that you ouch
huh very good
didn t know me own strength said the little fellow
hank curtis cabin was a stone s throw from the dancehall
hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the far north
hank was kind and human and our hero cold and hungry and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot
so the little fellow devised a way of getting breakfast
big jim recovered from the blow he received from black larson but lost his memory
hank s partner arrives
both are ready to leave on a long expedition
hank informs his partner that the little fellow is to look after the cabin while he s away
goodbye said hank and don t forget to feed the mule
since that night in the dancehall the little fellow hadn t seen georgia but an incident was to bring them together again
there she stood her loveliness lighting the room filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted
as she introduced her friends his heart began to sing
as they warmed up by the stove he excused himself to get firewood
and in that cabin his secret was revealed his love for georgia
and the girls giggled and laughed perhaps in order to hide their pity for in the world of the dancehall it wasn t wise for the girls to reveal their hearts
and so they thought they d have a little fun with him
there in the gloaming they sat their faces alight with mischief but all the while his heart was singing
and so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair
he knew she was fooling but he was happy for she was near him holding his hand smiling at him
nice place you have here said georgia
i hope you will invite us again
what if she were fooling
he was enjoying the warmth of her attention and the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair
and now she was leaving
the light of her loveliness would be gone
and he would be left with an emptiness to return to his bleak lonely existence
pardon me said the little fellow
but uh he was lost for words
would you really like to come again
of course said georgia
what do you say girls
we ll come for dinner new year s eve said the ladies
very well said georgia
we ll come to dinner new year s eve
of course at that moment georgia would forget her gloves
for the next few days the little fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that new year s dinner
the eve of a new year new hopes and new dreams
and there was georgia caressing him with her smiles and tender glances
and the girls called for a speech
but he was too happy to speak
all that mattered was georgia was there georgia
so he muttered and stuttered and finally said
i can t make a speech but i ll do a dance
and a dance he did with the rolls
should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind
should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne for auld lang syne my dear
in the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into georgia s mind
let s go up and visit the little fellow she said
we ll have some fun with him said jack
we ll send georgia in first then give him a scare
oh forget it said jack
how about giving me a little attention
a day or so later in the recorder s office
big jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold
where is this place they said
but big jim s memory had failed him
all he knew was that it was near the cabin
the cabin that s it
f i could find my way to the cabin i could find the mine
but i can t remember
hey said jack georgia s been looking for you
the little fellow knew otherwise
how dare that cad mention her name so lightly
for two pins he d give him another thrashing however being a little underweight he would ignore the insult
but it was true georgia had been looking for him
georgia had written him a letter
and as he went looking for georgia so big jim went looking for him
you you said big jim
you the very man i ve been looking for
the cabin the cabin
where is it
answer me i say
can t you speak man
tell me
where s the cabin where is it
at last i shall find my mountain of gold
to your feet man quick
you re coming with me
take me to the cabin and i ll make you a millionaire
georgia just a moment said the little fellow
georgia you don t have to explain i understand
i love you
i ll take you away from this life
i m going away and when i return
i shall come back
exhausted and footweary they arrived at the cabin
ah said big jim it won t be long now
bring in the eats and tomorrow we ll start for the mine
here take a swig of this
it ll put hair on your topcoat
my this is a heavy lamb chop said the little fellow
then fate - it s always fate - played its little joke and again the elements laughed roared and thundered but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered
then came the dawn
the little fellow awoke blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before but feeling definitely conscious of the morning after
oh well may as well tidy up and get breakfast
this is the worst liver attack i ve ever had
feel that rocking
it s the stomach
it s not the stomach
let s go to the other side
we ll see how far it will go over
something must be missing underneath
i ll go outside and see what it is
now said big jim don t get excited
take it easy don t move don t breathe
i said don t breathe stupid
you can be most annoying at times
if you ll only be cool be calm said big jim
we have nothing to worry about
now show a little character where s your willpower
now listen i ve got a very good idea
hold your hands like this then i can get out first
you see what i mean said big jim
your mind is chaotic you have no psychology
you have no control
and big jim discovered his claim
now we shall be rich said jim
we shall be millionaires
and so they were
now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of alaska to live in the land of milk and honey to live laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury
they were famous and sought after by the press
in their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon
the reporter wanted to write the little fellow s life story from rags to riches and he graciously consented
and big jim was manicured
not the nails said he the corns
the reporter thought of a good idea to have the little fellow pose in his mining clothes
it would make a human story
georgia
there she was in the steerage neither knew of the other s presence
georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard
you said georgia
i thought i d never see you again
and then she mistook him for the stowaway
the officer was going to put him in irons but georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare
heck said the captain that s no stowaway
that s big jim s partner the multimillionaire
then of course there were apologies
the little fellow gathered himself together james the valet was told to prepare for an extra guest
pardon me said the reporter but who s the lady
buzz buzz buzz
oh you don t say
well congratulations
this will make a great story and with a happy ending
and so it was a happy ending

it is barely possible you may hear of a ghost a phantom of the opera
the attendant of box five will not laugh when you ask about the opera ghost
you jest messieurs
we are not children
who occupies box five
i do not know
i have seen only the cloaked figure of a man who hides his face and will not speak
is it the phantom
the phantom
the phantom is up from the cellars again
we saw him for an instant a gray shadow and he was gone
he had no nose
yes he did it was enormous
that man came out of the cellars just after we saw the phantom
could it be that he
joseph buquet has really seen the phantom
let s ask him
his eyes are ghastly beads in which there is no light like holes in a grinning skull
his face is like leprous parchment yellow skin strung tight over protruding bones
his nose there is no nose
have a care buquet ghosts like not to be seen or talked about
come i ll show you where i saw him in the scene-dock of the third cellar
i saw him there
a flash of shadow and he was gone
my daughter carlotta has been insulted
mlle carlotte
christine daaé will sing the role of marguerite wednesday night
any jealous attempt on your part to interefere with the performance will prove disastrous to your career
the phantom
no ghost will frighten carlotta
wednesday night found mlle
what is this i hear about christine favoring some mysterious admirer
don t worry my dear brother - nothing shall interfere with our love
i hear alot of rumors raoul-be careful
at last you have realized your ambition my darling and now we shall be married
i can never leave the opera raoul
from hidden places beyond the walls a melodious voice like the voice of an angel spoke to her
christine tonight i placed the world at your feet
to you i have imparted the full measure of my art
you will triumph - all paris will worship you
but i warn you you must forget all worldly things and think only of your career - and your master
soon christine this spirit will take form and command your love
call for me when you will
i shall be waiting
in mlle carolotta s correspondence there appeared another letter edged in black
mlle carlotta if you appear tomorrow night you must be prepared for a great misfortune and therefore i advise you to be ill the phantom
christine daae s friends are plotting again
but my daughter shall sing tomorrow night come what may
my dear managers - the role of marguerite shall be sung again tomorrow evening by christine daae instead of carlotta the phantom
encouraged by her mother carlotta defied every warning and the following evening appeared as - marguerite
so far so good - for a house with a curse on it
i cannot explain but you must never intend to see me again
beware
she is singing to bring down the chandelier
christine i have come for you -
walk to your mirror my dear - - have no fear
christine it is i - your master
look not upon my mask - think rather of my devotion which has brought you the gift of song
a black lake hidden from man and the sun leading to the phantom s rendezvous
i have brought you here - - five cellars underground - - because i love you
for long weary months i have awaited this hour
so that which is good within me aroused by your purity might plead for your love
that is where i sleep
it keeps me reminded of that other dreamless sleep that cures all ills - forever
you
- your are the phantom
if i am the phantom it is because man s hatred has made me so
if i shall be saved it will be because your love redeems me
men once knew me as erik but for many years i have lived in these cellars a nameless legend
another phantom tragedy
christine daae disappears
the night passed - a night of vague horrors - - tortured dreams- -
christine
my dear christine you are in no peril as long as you do not touch my mask
you will be free as long as your love for the spirit of erik overcomes your fear
since first i saw your face this music has been singing to me of you and of - love triumphant
yet listen - - there sounds an ominous undercurrent of warning
feast your eyes - glut your soul on my accursed ugliness
oh mad christine who would not heed my warning
if you love me as you say let me go
i promise to your slave forever
i shall prove tlo you the debth of my love
you may return to your world for the present
but remember you are mine-mine-and you shall not see your lover again
if you do it is death to you both
oh i swear it i swear it
i shall never see him again
although i gave my word never to see you again i must
i will be at the bal masque tomorrow night but not alone beware
one night each year all paris mingled forgetful of caste- - the merry mad bal masque de l opera
into the midst of revelry strode a spectral figure robed in red
beneath your dancing feet are the tombs of tortured men - this does the red death rebuke your merriment
high above paris on the roof of the opera
are we alone raoul
can anyone overhear what we say
i have seen him raoul
i have seen the phantom
he is a monster - a loathsome beast
you must saveme from him raoul
mlle carlotta under the spell of his curse will never sing again
tomorrow i take her place in faust
i shall be at the stage door
we will flee to england

exited to devil s island for criminal insane
escaped now at large
this is your man monsleur le prefect
- the phantom of the opera
at nine o clock the following evening a mysterious barouche stopped on the rotunda side of the opera

save me from that monster - oh save me
my barouche is waiting outside

the strangler s work again
it was there
i saw the body dangling in the air
my brother - - poor joseph he knew too much about the phantom
the punjab lasso - the strangler s cord
assassin
fear for his brother s safety brought comte de chagny to the opera house that night
i think i can take you to christine daae - if you do exactly as i tell you
who are you that knows the phantom s secrets - and betrays them
i am ledoux of the secret police
i have studied this phantom for months
i found his hiding place deep within the torture chambers where he himself was confined during the second revolution
keep your hand up - the strangler s noose coils quick
your hand up - it is a matter of life or death
the discovery of this trap-door cost joseph buquet his life
i am a messenger from the shadows
- - turn back ere ye perish
you lied to me
do you think you and your lover could cheat the phantom
ungrateful fool
you have spurned the spirit that inspired you
- - the spirit that made you great
now you shall see the evil spirit that makes my evil face
no longer like a toad in these foul cellarswill i secrete the venom of hatred for you shall bring me love
we should be within his hiding place now
we have fallen into the room of many mirrors the old torture chamber
i am human like other men -
- i will not be cheated of my happiness
raoul raoul
my brother - where are you

arlington murderer arrested
what a bonehead i was to overlook that
mcdonald s alibi that he was at mrs o grady bird store will be investigated by the police
that means more investigation but there ain t goin to be no mrs o grady when they get here
yes there is goin to be a mrs o grady that dick saw me here
you guys can get out of your make-up but i can t
¡ and i ain t going to the chair alone
and neither is hector mcdonald going to the chair
now laugh that off
you big stiff
what are you going to do
you ll find out soon enough
regan is on his way to o grady s bird store
here s one thing stronger that you and i might need him
it was spring before the grim machinery of the law worked around to the case of hector mcdonald
does the defendant s attorney intend to produce the alleged witnesses mrs o grady and her grand-daught
127er 00 59 51 540 - - 00 59 56 050 we re making every effort to locate them
while in a secluded cabin in the mountains
in his prison cell he sits
how about just us two dividing the stuff
maybe i got a better palan
you can save him echo
and if you will i ll stick with you
i ll never see hector again
yes
you d stick with me
but you d go on loving him
and the minute he s free you d double-cross me and go back to him
don t you understand i ll do anything to save him
i love him echo i love him
i d even take that from you
after that you don t want to change your mind about sticking with me
he would always have rosie if he saved hector
this was the thought that took echo secretly to the city
your honor i object
he is mis-stating the evidence
objection over-ruled
have you lawyer put you back on the witness stand when you get there keep repeating the lord s prayer
move your lips but don t utter a sound
have faith in miracles mrs o grady
it s mrs o grady s handwriting
and she s not here
your honor may the defendant take the stand again to give new evidence
in a case so serious as his with a man s life at stake the court cannot reasonably deny your request
speak louder
your honor and gentlemen of the jury
there was an old woman who was a man
and two others the unholy three
first it was an old woman and her grand-daughter now the old woman is a man
what next
that wasn t me talking
i didn t say a word
and it must be remembered that defense has failed to produce a single witness to confirm the prisoner s story
you mean you want me to go with you
there s a fortune for just us two to split what do you say
do you think he s guilty
will he get the chair
i m echo the ventriloquist
grandma o grady of the unholy three
your honor i want to make a full confession
the law can be kind
and echo s confession won freedom for both himself and hector
dear hector
i ll never see you again
i can t explain but always summber i love you hector
i love you
good bya
rosie
echo you remember what i promised if you saved hector
well i m here
aw what s the use of us kiddin rosie
we don t love each other
you run along to hector
do you really mean that echo
good-by old pal
that s all there is to life friends a little laughter a little tear
the sorcerer
dinarzade
achmed
peri banu
aladdin
the witch
great was the might of the african sorcerer
in the city of the caliph they were celebrating the ruler s birthday
the great caliph
a magic horse exalted caliph which flies through the air
princess dinarzade the caliph s daughter
prince achmed her brother
i will not part with this horse for mere gold
so choose any of my treasures
may i have whatever i desire
i swear it-by the beard of the prophet
the story of prince achmed
how can one bring the horse back down to earth
the lever at the head drives it into the air
and the lever at the tail brings it to earth
does the prince know this
far from his homeland he landed on one of the magic islands of waq waq
the prince was young and brave and eager for adventure
who are you maidens
we serve the princess peri banu ruler of the spirit land of waq waq
stay with us handsome stranger
on a neighbouring island lay a magic lake where every night the exquisite peri banu and her attendants bathed
give back my cloak of feathers
come with me to my beautiful homeland
thus was the princess peri banu taken from the land of spirits
the horse carried them to far away china
do not be afraid of me
i am yours to command to the end of time
you do not know the power of the spirits of waq waq
they will kill you
allah s mercy will protect us if you will be my wife
meanwhile the sorcerer searched for his magic horse
we will find our home and you will forget all about waq waq
i will follow you
the prince sends you this garment
he bids me lead you to him
adventures in china
the emperor of china
the emperor s jester
hither the sorcerer brought peri banu to sell her to the emperor
the emperor smiled upon peri banu
kill her or take her to wife
now my brave prince i shall return to your sister
in this mountain dwelt the sorcerer s greatest enemy the fire mountain witch
how dare you come to my magic mountain
the african sorcerer brought me hither
he is my greatest enemy
and we are friends
the bridegroom
help me free peri banu
i fear no spirits
with these weapons you can conquer the spirits
the bride
far below at that moment the wedding of peri banu
we must stop the wedding
the spirits of waq waq look for their mistress
take me to waq waq
the gates of waq waq open only to the one who the magic lamp of aladdin possesses
aladdin and the magic lamp
i am aladdin
where is the magic lamp
do you not have it
i will tell you
i was a poor tailor in the city of the caliph
one day i was visited by a mysterious stranger
behold dinarzade the daughter of the caliph
you shall have her once you do something for me
he led me to a high mountain
the magic lamp
fetch the lamp
give me the lamp
first let me out
then die
i have other ways to obtain the lamp
i languished long in the dark cave until i succeeded in lighting the lamp
what is your command o master
i am your servant i and all the spirits of the lamp
take me home
now i knew i could win the princess dinarzade
in a single night i built her a splendid palace
next morning the astounded caliph visited the enchanted building
so she became my wife
the caliph is my father dinarzade-my sister
tell me what happened further
one day everything vanished - the palace dinarzade and the lamp
i fled before the fury of the caliph
i set out to sea
a fearful storm blew up
and so you found me
do you know who did this to you
the african sorcerer
he loved dinarzade
hurry achmed and free peri banu
the spirits want to kill her because she left to follow you
the sorcerer has stolen the magic lamp
only the lamp can open the gates of waq waq
kill the sorcerer and the lamp is yours
kill him
i will try
your enemy is dead
the spirit battle of waq waq
the spirits rose up against their faithless mistress
prince achmed stands before the gates
bring out peri banu
summon the spirits of the lamp aladdin
yet the spirits of darkness came before him
aladdin was overwhelmed
the lamp
the witch intervened
now legions of benevolent spirits streamed out of the magic lamp
behold
the palace
return and seek happiness in the land of mortals
dinarzade must be in the palace
the towers of the caliph s city soon appeared before them
aladdin s palace has returned
meanwhile the call to morning prayer sounded from the minarets

the end subtitle by reza fa
secret of a soul a psychoanalytic film
inside every person there are desires and passions which remain unknown to consciousness
in the dark hours of psychological conflict these unconscious drives attempt to assert themselves mysterious illnesses arise from such struggles the resolution and cure of which form the field of psychoanalysis
in the hands of the psycho - analytically trained doctor the teaching of university professor sigmund freud represent an important advance in the treatment of these types of psychological illnesses
the events in this film are taken from life
they do not deviate in any important factual way from the actual medical case history
help
last night
with a razor
come
papa s expecting us
woman gruesomely murdered
i m from the homicide department
we d like to know if you observed anything relevant to the crime committed last night in the house nearby
no we just heard the cries for help this morning
meanwhile a surprise was waiting by the hearth
my friends
i am finally swimming toward home sumatra lies behind me and in a short while i shall be with you i am sending these guest present on ahead
the dream
sincerely your cousin hans
i dreamt terrible things
it was horrible
your wife says that her cousin has arrived
you must excuse me
i cannot eat with you
i can t touch the knife
you left this key lying in the café
is there some reason you re reluctant to enter your house
sorry it s part of my job
my friend left his house last night greatly agitated and has not yet returned
we re very concerned
we fear an accident
since the murder in the neighboring house my husband has been completely distraught
we ve received no reports of any accidents incidentally the murderer was arrested today in munich
and worst of all last night i felt a sudden compulsion to kill my wife whom i love more than anything
do you know of no one who can help you
you mean dr orth
he lives just across the way
i didn t expect that we would meet again so soon
i m coming to you because i m totally distraught
tormented by inexplicable fears
it is impossible for me to touch a knife
we do know of such illneses and also of the possibility of their cure
but that s not all
i am happily married and yet yesterday evening i was overcome with an almost irresistible urge to kill my wife
isn t that crazy
no but it may be a sign of serious psychological illness
there s no reason to despair
perhaps i can help you
there is a method called psychoanalysis that i like to apply with such illnesses
i ve reserved a room at a hotel
believe me it s better that way
i m taking charge of your husband s treatment
it is better during the treatment period which will last several months that your husband does not live at home
that is everything doctor
no that is by no means everything
you can be cured only when we have worked together to uncover the unconscious psychological conflicts which led to your illness
you will start by telling me everything you see in your mind s eye
don t hold back anything because you think it is unimportant or nonsensical
thoughts will come up that you may not wish to express tell them to me anyway
a few day ago in the morning in my wife s bedroom i suddenly heard
help
last night
with a razor
the impressions of that morning shook you greatly psychologically had you recently quarreled with your wife
no
i grew up with my wife marriage to her has given my life its meaning
we were deeply in love and wanted children but
did something happen to cause you to give up hope of progeny
i don t know
but lately i have been plagued by terrible fantasies i have seen my wife in shameful situations
what are the characteristics of this man who has appeared to you in these fantasies
wait a minute
it s my childhood friend my wife s cousin
did your wife give you a reason to be jealous of her cousin
he is my best friend
shortly after our wedding he left us
to go to the tropics i was never consciously jealous of him
as he took his leave from us i felt a strange emotion stirring in me
then years went by
on the day before the outbreak of my illness we received a letter from him that he was returning
months passed of arduous work by doctor and patient finally today
an important new memory rose to consciousness in the parlent
on the night before the outbreak of my illness there was a bad storm
i had terrible dreams that night
since we have learned to interpret it the dream has become the most important door to our knowledge of the unconscious
the images are muddled
i don t want to look at them
you may not give in to this resistance
arriving today at 10 30 a m cousin hans
when i got the telephone message that our cousin had arrives
that is a typical mistake to make when receiving news that is unconsciously unwelcome
in the dream i stood before an indian idol
sincerely your cousin hans
why is this exotic image in your dream
in the dream a small italian city one i saw frequently on our honeymoon emerged before my eyes a bell tower grew steeply up out of the ground
the laughing of these three women s heads was terrible
did you recognize the women
these humiliations hit you in your most vulnerable spot
then in the dream i stood before a prison cell and looked through the bars
what did you see
in your nightmare the small wound on your wife s neck flowed together with the crime in the nearby house for this reason you saw yourself condemned as a murderer
these dream fantasies led in your consciousness to a morbid aversion to touching a knife
so this psychological illness kept you from killing your wife
were you finished with your dream of the trial
no
i saw water
turbulent dark water
it has long been known that dreams of water signify imminent or wished for birth
she gives the doll to her cousin
did you ever experience anything similar in your childhood
back then she gave our doll to her cousin
the pain that you experienced when your wife gave our doll to her cousin has remained awake in your childless marriage
in the dream i got into a furious rage
have you notices what you re holding in your hand
i am able to touch a knife again
i ve got a lot to apologize for
epilogue
the end english subtitles transcribed by norgen norgen @ centrum cz
soon after its premiere the film metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made
from that time onward more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost
then in 2008 a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in buenos aires
what had been preserved was however a heavily damaged copy of the film that had been printed to 16mm film stock lacking the full frame of the picture s original aspect ratio
a considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this argentinian material
spanish intertitles have been translated into german with the aid of the censor-cards
in order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black
the intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment
those titles which appear in a different typeface like the one used here have been added to summarise the content of still-missing scenes as far as is necessary to facilitate an adequate understanding of the storyline
shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader

epigraph
the mediator between head and hands must be the heart
shift change
deep beneath the earth lay the city of the workers
as deep beneath the earth as the city of the workers lay so high above it towered the complex known as the sons club with its lecture halls and libraries its theatres and stadiums
fathers for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the eternal gardens
which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining master freder joh fredersen s son
look
these are your brothers
look -
these are your brothers
who - was that
but this was what happened to freder - the son of joh fredersen the master of metropolis - as he sought out the girl
to the new tower of babel - to my father -
why is it josaphat that i learn of this explosion from my son and not from you -
details -
what were you looking for in the machine-halls freder
i wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers my sisters
your magnificent city father - and you the brain of this city - and all of us within the light of this city - and where are the people father whose hands built your city -
off where they belong off where they belong
in the depths
and if those in the depths one day rise against you
the chief foreman of the heart-machine grot - with an important message
there were two more copies of those damnable plans herr fredersen in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the m-machine
how is it josaphat that these plans were brought to me by grot rather than by you
apply to the g-bank for your remaining wages
father do you know what it means to be dismissed by you
it means to be sent below
- father - below
into the depths -
do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by joh fredersen
would you like to come with me josaphat
go home josaphat and wait for me
i still have a long way to go tonight
into the depths - to my brothers
from today on i wish to be kept precisely informed of my son s every move
brother the machine
me
listen to me
i want to trade my life with you
josaphat
99th block house 7 7th floor
wait for me - both of you
josaphat
in the middle of metropolis there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked
the man who dwelled within was rotwang the inventor
hel
born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind
lost to joh fredersen
died giving life to freder joh fredersen s son
a mind like yours rotwang should be able to forget
only one time in life did i forget something
that hel was a woman - and you a man
let the dead lie rotwang
she s dead for you as she is for me
for me she isn t dead joh fredersen - for me she lives -
do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating hel -
do you wish to see her -
now joh fredersen -
isn t it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future - the machine-man -
24 more hours of work - and no man joh fredersen will be able to differentiate the machine-man from a mortal -
the woman is mine joh fredersen
hel s son was yours
and what brings you my way joh fredersen
i need your advice - as usual when all my experts fail me
can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers
at two once my shift ends
she has summoned us again
father -
father -
will ten hours never come to an end -
- it s a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your metropolis
i should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs
today i shall tell you the legend of the construction of the tower of babel
the legend of the construction of the tower of babel
come
let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars
and at the tower s zenith we shall write
great is the world and its maker
and great is man
but those who had conceived of the tower of babel could not build the tower of babel
the task was too great
so they paid wages to outside hands
but the hands that built the tower of babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising
the hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others
the same language was spoken but these men did not understand one another
great is the world and its maker and great is man
head and hands require a mediator
the mediator between head and hands must be the heart
and where is our mediator maria -
wait for him
he will surely come
we will wait maria
but not for much longer -
oh mediator have you finally come
you summoned me - here i am
rotwang give the machine-man the likeness of this woman
i shall sow discord between them and her
i shall destroy their belief in this woman -
leave me alone now joh fredersen
you ll find the way back without me
now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from hel your son
until tomorrow in the cathedral
end of the prelude
intermezzo
freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches
verily i say unto you the days of which the apocalypse speaks draw nigh
the monk s hand points to the bible in which it is written
and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour having a golden cup in her hand and upon her forehead was a name written a mystery
babylon the great the mother of abominations ofthe earth
and i saw the woman drunken with the blood ofthe saints
you will annihilate joh fredersen - him and his city and his son -
gluttony
avarice
pride
lust
envy
anger
sloth
had you come earlier you wouldn t have frightened me
i now beg of you stay away from me and my beloved
where is the one whose clothes you are wearing

josaphat
99th block house 7 7th floor
so what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight
you still don t seem to have grasped who sent me here
central bank of metropolis
this man doesn t want his son to find you still here tonight
in three hours time i shall be calling for you
come
it is time to give the man-machine your face
where is maria -
she s with your father
i m telling you she is with your father -
she is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed
tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes ofthe upper hundred
you shall see her dance and if only one single person recognises the machine in her i will call myself a bungler who never succeeded at anything
c rotwang
c a rotwang requests herr joh fredersen to be his guest this evening
i want you to go to those in the depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype
c a rotwang requests herr joh fredersen to be his guest this evening
verily i say unto you the days of which the apocalypse speaks draw nigh
all seven deadly sins on her behalf -
death overtakes the city -
end of the intermezzo
the revelation of st john avalun publishing hellerau
i escaped from the thin man wearing this attire
but for ten days your father s bloodhound has been making the workers city unsafe
the only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the mediator promised unto them
even stranger things have been happening freder
on that evening when you fell ill once the best of friends
because of that woman the other man
on that same evening the eternal gardens lie abandoned
but night after night in yoshiwara
and this woman at whose feet all sins are heaped is also called maria
that same woman that those in the depths regard as a saint -
many now go to the city of the dead to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold
the mediator is not likely to miss that occasion
whatever happens tonight
it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please
joh fredersen wants to let those in the depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them
when you spoke to your poor brothers you talked about peace maria today a mouthpiece of joh fredersen incites them to rebel against him
she will destroy their belief in the mediator
you know i ve always talked about peace
but your mediator hasn t come
you ve waited long enough
your time has come -
but i ve tricked joh fredersen
your clone does not obey his will - only mine alone
who is the living fodder for the machines for metropolis -
who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow -
who feeds the machines with their own flesh -
let the machines starve you fools -
finish them off -
do them in - these machines -
you aren t maria -
you are not maria -
maria talks of peace not murder -
this is not maria -
joh fredersen s son -
do him in the dog in his white silken hide -
get your women your sons out of the workers city
let no-one stay behind
death to the machines -
in the attic of his home
rotwang displays for maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over fredersen
- and twice over did i trick joh fredersen -
for i concealed from him that his son wants to be the mediator of your brothers - and is in love with you -
maria isn t the only one listening to rotwang
on the other side of the attic s window joh fredersen was eavesdropping
joh fredersen breaks into rotwang s attic
he wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him
maria is free
faithful after all
come freder
we still have to go through the workers city
women and men let no-one miss out on today -
death to the machines -
not one man - not one woman has stayed behind -
leave the machines -
let them race to their death -
to the heart-machine -
danger
open the gates
you have to open the gates
if the heart-machine perishes nothing in the machine-district will be left standing -
have you lost your minds -
if the heart-machine perishes the entire workers city will be laid to waste -
where are your fathers your mothers
do you have any idea that your son is amongst the workers
yes - you
you re maria -
to the air shafts - quickly
quickly the reservoirs have burst
the city is drowning -
we ll take the children to the sons club
why are all the lights out
i need to know -
where is my son
tomorrow thousands will ask in fury and desperation
joh fredersen where is my son -
where are your children
the city is drowned the shafts are totally flooded -
who bade you attack the machines without which you re finished you idiots -
it s the witch s fault -
we ll be looking on as the world goes to the devil -
find the witch this is all her fault -
strike her dead -
now i m going to take you home my hel -
the witch -
the witch - there she is -
there she is -
where are our children you witch you -
burn the witch - to the stake with her
to the stake with her -
hel -
my hel -
your children saved -
head and hands want to join together but they don t have the heart to do it
oh mediator show them the way to one another
the mediator between head and hands must be the heart
buster keaton in college
on the sunkist slopes of the pacific where land and water meet - -
high school graduation day where the next step is either go to college or go to work
a few drops of rain couldn t dampen a mother s enthusiasm on her son s graduation day
mary haynes - winner of every popularity contest in which the boys were allowed to vote
jeff brown - star athlete who believed so much in exercise that he made many a girl walk home
i didn t think you would call for me in the rain
young man it s time you graduated
i know you are going to be as popular at clayton college as you were here
it is my pleasure to present this diploma to our most brilliant scholar
- and your scholastic record richly merits this honor medal
ronald will now speak on the curse of athletics
the secret of getting a medal like mine is - - books not sports
the student who wastes his time on athletics rather than study shows only ignorance
future generations depend upon brains and not upon jumping the discus or hurdling the javelin
what have ty ruth or babe dempsey done for science
where would i be without my books
your speech was ridiculous
anyone prefers an athlete to a weak-knee d teachers pet
when you change your mind about athletics then i ll change my mind about you
mary is going to enter clayton i wish i could go
i m afraid we can t afford it dear
i can work my way through other boys do
so the following term ronald arrived at clayton and was met by
i need another clerk as good as he is
you can commence tomorrow
well if it isn t the student prince
your principal writes me what an excellent student you are
a boy like you can make this athlete-infested college a seat of learning once more
you boys will do well to follow the example of this young scholar
sunday found ronald taking fizzical exercise
you play third base for the second team
you forced two men out and you re out too
wanted colored waiter
bring me something you can t stick your thumb in
clayton s wonder track team training for the intercollegiate meet
don t get too interested in that campus clown -
- you re supposed to be going with me
you take an awful lot for granted
a call to the dean s office meant only one thing - grief
you have been a miserable failure in all your studies and i know the reason why
i took up athletics because the girl i love thinks i m a weakling
i love her and would do anything to please her
i understand my boy
the same thing happened to me but i was stubborn
here s a list of the men eligible for the rowing crew
coach i d like to have you make this young man coxswain of the crew
his size and weight are perfect and he has brains
clayton can t lose the boat race now
boys get out the smelling salts - -
it s the dean s orders
- unless something happens to the poor boy
the day of the race
hey coach - nothing has happened to mama s boy
don t worry - you re coxswain
give him this and he ll wake up just in time for the football season
if you were seen in my room it would mean expulsion for me
that s just what i want
i was expelled this morning and thought i would like to take you with me
i m going to stay here until we are discovered - then you might change your mind about marrying me
boys we ve got to win
if we don t rowing will be a thing of the past at clayton
is ronald our coxswain to-day
certainly not
the rival crew ready for their most important race of the year
go on they are waiting for you
hurry - jeff has me locked here in my room and he -
young lady do you know what this means
yes - it means we are going to be married

the passion of joan of arc
a film by carl th dreyer
at the bibliotheque de la chambre des deputes in paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world
the record of the trial of joan of arc the trial that ended in her death
the questions of the judges and joan s responses were recorded exactly
reading it we discover the real joan not in armor but simple and human a young woman who died for her country and we are witness to an amazing drama
a young pious woman confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges
i swear to tell the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth
in france i m called joan in my village i m called jeannette
how old are you
nineteen
i think
do you know the lord s prayer
who taught it to you
my mother
will you recite it
you claim to be sent by god
to save france it s why i was born
so you think god hates the english
i don t know if god loves or hates the english but i do know that the english will all be chased from france except those that die here
you have said that st michael appeared to you in what form
did he have wings
did he wear a crown
how was he dressed
how did you know if it was a man or a woman
was he naked
do you think god was unable to clothe him
did he have long hair
why would he have cut it
why do you wear men s clothing
if we give you women s clothing would you wear it
when the mission that god has entrusted to me is over i will again dress as a woman
so it is god who orders you to dress as a man
and what reward do you expect from our lord
the salvation of my soul
you blaspheme god
this is disgraceful
for me she is a saint
has god made you promises
that has nothing to do with your trial
shouldn t we let the judges decide that
shall we put this question to a vote
so
what has god promised you
perhaps that you will be delivered from prison
when
i know neither the day nor the hour
since she couldn t be made to confess easily we will have to be clever
go find a letter bearing the signature of king charles
write the letter that i will dictate
i have great pity for you
do you know the signature of your king
i have a letter from him to you
i can t read
to our beloved joan
i am preparing to march on rouen with a mighty army
i send you this devoted priest have confidence in him
just as jesus is the son of god you claim to be the daughter of god
will you now recite the lord s prayer
god has told you that you shall be delivered from prison
by a great victory
god has promised you that you will go to heaven
so you are certain of being saved
be careful it s a dangerous answer
since you are sure of your salvation then you have no need of the church
are you in a state of grace
well respond
are you in a state of grace
if i am may god keep me there
if i am not may god grant it to me
father permit me to attend mass
joan if we permit you to attend mass will you stop wearing men s clothes
so you would rather dress as a man than attend mass
these shameless clothes abominable to god
you are no daughter of god
you are satan s creature
go prepare the torture chamber
she really looks like a daughter of god
in the torture chamber
look at your judges
don`t you feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you
but god is even wiser
listen joan we know that your visions do not come from god but from the devil
how do you know a good angel from an evil angel
you have knelt before satan not st michael
don t you see that it s the devil who has turned your head who has tricked you and betrayed you
i think she s ready to abjure
the church opens its arms to you if you reject it the church will abandon you and you will be alone alone
yes alone alone with god
even if you part my soul from my body i will revoke nothing and if i say something later i will say it was forced from me
not for anything in the world do i want her to die a natural death
she is very weak
she has a fever we must bleed her
be careful she could end her own life she s very crafty
bring the sacraments
is there something you wish to tell us
i fear to be in great danger of death and if i die i ask you to bury my body in sacred ground
the church is merciful it always welcomes the misguided lamb
joan we all want what s best for you
look i have sent for the sacraments
i am a good christian
don`t you know it is the body of the lord that you refuse
do you not see that you outrage god by your obstinacy
i love and honor god
with all my heart
you claim that i am
sent by the devil
it s not true to make me suffer the devil has sent you and you and you and you
there is nothing left to be done alert the torturer
let us try one last time to save this lost soul
it is to you joan that i speak
it is to you that i say that your king is a heretic
my king is the most noble christian of all christians
the arrogance of this woman is insane
france has never seen such a monster
i have never wronged anyone
if you do not sign you will be burned alive
see the torturer who awaits
you don t have the right to die
your king still needs you
joan sign
and save your life
joan we have great pity for you
sign joan
in the name of the lord
amen
since you recognized your errors we exonerate you from the bonds of excommunication
but because you have greatly sinned we condemn you to perpetual imprisonment with the bread of sorrow and the water of anguish
you made a good day s work
you have saved your life and your soul
she has only made fools of you
long live joan
go find the judges
i take it back i have lied
hurry
i have committed a great sin i have denied god to save my life but joan before the people you have confessed that you were inspired by the devil
you still believe you were elect by the lord
that answer is equivalent to death
i acknowledged from fear of the fire
have you anything else to tell us
we have come to prepare you for death
now already
which death
at the stake
i ll bring the last sacrament
tell me how can you still believe that you are sent by god
his ways are not our ways
yes i am his child
and the great victory
my martyrdom
and your deliverance
death
will you take confession

his wedding cannot be postponed any longer
the famous rodrigo quast wants to do a big variety act with me

i forbade you to come here
i haven t come to see you
alwa

you must acquit her she is innocent
your honours
members of the jury the greek gods created a woman
pandora she was beautiful charming versed in the art of flattery
but the gods also gave her a box containing the evils of the world the headless woman opened the box and the evils were loosed upon us
counsel for the defence portrays the accused as a persecuted innocent i call her pandora because she brought evil upon dr schön
the arguments of the defence do not sway me
i demand the death penalty

wait here until it stops raining
do you know what
let it rain you can spend the night in my house
hurry up andrea i must go to work
you know that i am afraid of strangers father
don t be silly this man is no thief
where would you go
there is no hotel in our village
the storm must have cut off the wires
i know you shall never come back
and
what s the matter
would you mind if i leave father
do you want to visit your aunt
very well then go
why do people forget so quickly
why do people forget so quickly
i yearn for you though i know you will never return
i do not dare to die
it would kill my father if i told him
i am so helpless
i cosset it inside of me even if i feel that my life has reached its end
i do not know why i write this letter but i feel relief in knowing that you have not thought about me once
my poor husband is waiting for me at the theatre
what will you tell him about where you were
with my lover
you would never say that
your key
who is that gentleman
where does he live
tell him to wait
you can say whatever you wish
i know you are lying
i would not like to be in her shoes
you re impossible you would even delude a saint
did your little daughter write
it is said he will soon be a grandfather
they say she tied that man who spent the night at your house
no one will dare touch the chastity of my daughter
your child was stillborn
perhaps it is better for you this way
how some men handle their love affairs
you see you were here a few days longer and bed and board costs money
wandering aimlessly
i am sending you some money do not take everything so tragically
but you wanted to go the other way
the man who was to come for the blood transfusion is not here
maybe i
do you know how you got injured
your wife saved you your life
my wife
yes your wife
don t you remember
you brought her here in your car
could you bring my wife here then
i am sorry but i can deliver this piano model only in a few weeks as i have just sold the last one
my wife
i can wait a few weeks for the other piano
dangerous friendship
you were not home because you knew i would come
he is a fine man
i hope he will make a good impression on you
and in the evening in the morning in the morning i ask you to reject my husband s invitation
forgive me i should have done that myself
i know what pain i have caused you
you may laugh at whatever i say to apologise to you
have you forgiven me
yet in the evening
i love you and i am jealous of you because you love your husband
andrea i want you to
do not lie to me he is the man who had your picture
who
that annoying man
i do not know him at all
i will keep an eye on that gentleman
you must come with us tomorrow we will be most pleased if you join us
if you only knew what i think of him
and what i think of you
not even an angel could put up with you
i love you so much because you are not like other men you are not jealous
i am not jealous because i trust you
i have a terrible headache
i am so tired
i almost forgot
i will give you back your key you will need it for someone else
on the trip
on the trip
don t you think that leading a simple family life is most fortunate
why don t you get married then
it is quite simple and easy
that is what you think
i think you will lose
do you want me to lose
we did not have time to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow
it is my wife s wish
it is so nice in the south at this time of the year
yes it is nice indeed
i hope to see you soon again
what kind of a comedy is this
why aren t you sincere andrea
i was never more sincere as today
i think our trip will do you good you will calm down
i am calm but you are jealous and you are running away like a coward
how love ends
give this letter to my husband at 5 o clock
very well
this is the end then
you shall never see me again
was anyone here
will you believe me if i say that no one
to loyalty - to all women
i swear your wife is not in the room

thursday 17 august 1896
hypothetical account of the gold content in the mountains of the moon
i maintain after many years of comparative analyses that primitive moon-rock contains more gold than the earth s mountains
one day the first spaceship will fly to the moon to bring its gold back to the earth
laughter gentlemen is the argument of idiots against every new idea -
the progress of the world will not fail due to learned ignoramuses lacking in fantasy whose brains work in inverse proportion to their calcification -
professor - i ve decided to go
but not without me helius - not without me -
now your idea will triumph after all professor
naturally windegger will go along
what -
windegger won t -
your collaborator and best friend
friede velten student of astronomy and hans windegger chief engineer of helius hangars are engaged
dear friede
best wishes to you and hans
don t be upset that i can t come tonight to your engagement party
please accept the flowers as a substitute
yours wolf helius
he doesn t even know anything about my decision - no-one does - except for you
i tell you helius more people than you and i know of your plan -
- and the fellow whom i threw down the stairs before is one of them -
three nights ago -
so you think someone knows of my plans and is thus also interested in your moon-gold theory
helius don t be angry - it s my life s work - go home -
i can t rest until i know the manuscript is in your safe
dear helius
i write to you in incomparable bliss and you should be the first to know that friede has agreed to be my wife
perhaps i took her a bit by surprise but she said yes
come tonight to the engagement party at friede s apartment
i am ridiculously happy
windegger
fresh violets sir
wolf helius bergstr 86-3 to be delivered in person
mr helius isn t home
please let me wait for mr helius anyway
mr windegger sent me
to be delivered in person
dear helius
accept this poor soul if you can and give him work and a chance to make a life - he won t disappoint you
warmest regards windegger
drive to the nearest police station - don t hold things up with long explanations - just bring some sort of officer here to me
god in heaven
you must have some idea when you last phoned -
did you leave the flat unattended -
only for a moment when gustav came to get me but then there was that man whom mr windegger had sent -
would you allow me to use your telephone
my phone isn t working
christ madame - someone has to pick up - there s at least half a dozen people sitting around that phone -
i m only the foreman of helius hangars - but if you keep working like this you miss friede will soon be the forewoman of us all
i was supposed to have sent you somebody with a letter of recommendation -
i m begging you hans get over here
i can t tell you over the telephone what this is all about just please come
you can be assured hans that i would not call you away from your engagement party if it weren t absolutely necessary
we ll be there right away helius
allow me to introduce myself -
turner
if you go flying down those steps again mr turner
i won t be standing at the bottom to catch you
believe me mr helius there s no wiser way to pass the time till the arrival of ms velten and mr windegger than to have a chat with me
first a small request tell your chauffeur it s no longer necessary to inform the police
the police have already been informed mr turner
just a measure of caution mr helius - as well as this
also a measure of caution mr turner
i now grasp the phenomenon mr turner how you haven t been whiling away in prison all this time -
you do flatter mr helius
perhaps you can also reveal to me mr turner where the stolen manuscript - and the contents missing from my safe are located -
five of the wealthiest and cleverest minds who wish to keep the earth s gold-reserve under their control -
one of the most interesting documents madame and sirs
to prove the accessibility of the moon
helius sent the unmanned trial-rocket h 23 filled with magnesium moonward - the explosion of which upon impact was viewed and photographed from the earth
thanks to the competence of our representative
i can show you something completely different - things that helius himself has thus far not made available to the scientific community
cinematographic images of the surface of the moon by h 32 during its first orbit of the moon the unmanned register-rocket h 32 equipped with automatic imaging-instruments
the rocket-jet
in its nose-cone is located the egg-shaped register-chamber with the automated imaging-instruments
the imaging-instrument linked to a clockwork
the mirror tele-objective
schematic depiction of the h 32 s trajectory
gravitational field of the moon
zero-g zone
trajectory of h 32
necessary starting speed 11 200 metres per second
first image of the moon 36 hours after liftoff
distance of the rocket from the moon approx 40 000 km
at an altitude of approx 1000 km h 32 flies over the moon-crater eratosthenes -
- in its depths the astronomer w h pickering director of mandeville observatory jamaica believes to have observed swarms of insects
the objective s eye sees what no man s eye has ever seen
the opposite side of the moon turned away from the earth
cryptic monochrome planes of colossal dimensions -
vegetation
fog
water -
- all seem to confirm the theory of prof peter andreas hansen
- of the seeberg observatory near gotha - that on the opposite side of the moon exists an atmosphere and therefore life
why lose more time
i for one want the moon s riches of gold should they actually prove to exist to fall into the hands of businessmen and not visionaries and idealists
at this moment our representative is making
mr helius aware of our intentions in a very concrete manner
you have only two choices mr helius
either make the trip to the moon in our employ -
- or not at all
if we don t come to an agreement mr helius five minutes after my departure your hangar along with the nearly completed spaceship will be reduced to a heap of rubble
what would you gain by killing me off mr helius
- at the most a travel companion who is less considerate
you still don t get the picture mr helius we d rather annihilate all of your plans than let you shut us out of the operation
tell your clients mr turner that i do not aim to found upon the moon a criminal-colony
give me 24 hours to think it over
will your plans be seriously affected by the theft helius
don t worry about the plans -
i have duplicates of everything safe in my desk s secret compartment
hans dear if i were you i wouldn t be so sure about that
why did you conceal from us helius the fact that you now actually want to take on the voyage to the moon
you ve called me your good comrade so often at work - in the laboratory - in this very room now you want to lie to me helius
i didn t mean to lie to you friede -
i just wanted to spare hans the conflict between his love for you and his sense of duty towards the work we ve been doing
but do you really believe helius that hans would ever be capable of letting you down
oh no helius you won t make the trip to the moon without windegger
- and not without me -
have you forgotten friede how those fared that dared this trip to the moon before us -
in memory of to the bold pioneers of space navigation
who did not return from their journey into outer-space
friede - don t you get it
i just couldn t stand to know you were in danger - god in heaven - and what danger indeed -
he s decided to travel to the moon hans
so when do we start -
and who will go with us
ask friede
friede you want to go with me -
in exactly 24 hours
mr helius the 24 hours for consideration were up 61 minutes ago
the explosion is of no concern mr helius - it s nothing but a small accentuation of my offers
the price of this first warning mr windegger is the hangar
just a shack the second one will cost the lives of men the third the spaceship
don t force me mr helius to take stronger measures
choose the lesser of two evils - me
i give you my word mr helius the very hour that we come to an agreement you ll get your stolen material back complete and in perfect condition the spaceship friede peace is ready for launch
at moonrise the spaceship will soar into outer-space only to land - if god sees fit - 36 hours later upon the opposite side of the moon at this moment bells will ring - the sirens of all the factories trains and ships
in this final hour i must once again warn all of you
you manfeldt and you - mr turner
i m leaving out windegger
and as for you friede -
friede in this last minute - i m begging you -
don t beg me helius
helius in this last instant do you want to shame me as a woman
the whole world s eyes are directed upon us - the whole world s ears are listening to us
everyone to their stations we launch in 50 minutes -
the whole world s eyes are directed upon us - the whole world s ears are listening to us
just now just now the just now the spaceship
just now the spaceship has reached the launch pad because the spaceship is built too light to stand freely it s submerged in a water-basin in which it floats upright
from the moment of launch till attaining the necessary speed of 11 200 km per second
there will be 8 critical minutes in the battle with the increase in speed with g-force which has a fatal effect upon human organisms when it goes over 40 metres per second
after these 8 minutes during which we ll feel an intolerable burden pulling our bodies back to earth we ll be victors in the battle with gravitational force or -
and if we aren t able to maintain our speed of 11200 then we ll hurtle - and hurtle - further - and further still -
- irretrievably lost in outer-space - never again never again
i ll be the one to pull the stop-lever windegger
60 seconds to go - 20 seconds to go - lie still - take a deep breath -
10 seconds to go -
now
launch-rocket depleted
full-throttle on middle-rocket
win-degger jet-tison middle - ro-cket
turn back
maybe this chap is dead
i think josephine needs a brandy
i think mr turner needs one even more -
don t you see someone is stowed away in the cargo hold
okay you wretched scoundrel how did you get in here
i ve devoted my whole life to moon-issues mr helius
moon vampire
the mystery of the deadly moon-rays
the earth where is our earth -
the sun is rising on our earth
logbook of the spaceship friede
turning the spaceship s black side toward the sun to absorb warmth -
all s well on board
227 000 km from earth stopping the last jets flying without propulsion weightlessness on board
have entered the moon s gravitational field - are within 9000 km of the moon
through the directional boosts mentioned above weight regained on board
turning the spaceship with the jets in direction of destination to fire brake boosts to prevent premature crash on the moon -
are about to reach the side of the moon facing away from earth
we re seeing it again hans we re seeing it again
and when are we finally going to land
if we had a spark of reason in us we wouldn t ever land -
you re just afraid - you wimp -
tell him he has no right to jeopardise all our lives for the sake of his ambition
by god now is not the time for arguments hans -
shut the window-hatches -
full brake-power - we re plummeting -
hold on tight -
the ignition cable probably isn t going to fix itself
the moon awaits
first though we have to do an air-sample to tell whether we can breathe outside
do what you want
i m only interested in how i ll get back out of here
i ll tell you just one thing friede as soon as i have the spaceship ready to launch again i ll fly back to earth - and neither helius nor manfeldt will stop me -
do you really aim to stab helius in the back
do you really aim to stab me in the back
now helius has no choice but to prepare right away for the trip back -
but helius is convinced that we ll find water with the divining rod
you know what the only thing is that we ll find on the moon -
- death
professor please help me with the air-sample
for god s sake don t open it -
if he opens the outer door and outside there s no breathable atmosphere then we re done for good
he s taken the divining rod with him
it s as if the rod is pulling him forward
mingo would follow this trail mr helius
the main objective should be to look for water
i have enough to do to get us ready to launch again
may i volunteer to look for professor manfeldt and at the same time water
atmosfere breathable not yet analised
törner on the trale for 3 hours of manfeldt searching for water
since when is gustav your secretary
i can t stand it anymore i m going to look for manfeldt -
from miss friede so you won t go hungry
professor -
professor - professor -
don t let him into the ship don t let him into the ship
is there anyone in the world to whom we should relay your last regards - if we get back to earth
the oxygen containers - the shot hit the oxygen containers -
what does this mean miss friede with the oxygen containers
let s pray to god it means nothing
we ve lost more than half of the oxygen
that means one of us can t go back to earth -
one of us has to stay on the moon -
yes windegger one of us
do you know what this means - do you
to stay here - alone on the moon - just because you didn t want to listen to me - you and him
short one loses - long one wins and we draw three times
you draw -
so draw then -
would it be easier for you hans if i stayed with you on the moon
i have only one desire to get back to earth -
let s drink to a happy homecoming to earth - for all of us to a happy homecoming - for all of us hans
the base-camp is ready mr helius
now you must prove gustav that i can rely upon you
i m staying back here on the moon
- and you will guide the spaceship away from the moon
do you want mr windegger to perish -
and miss friede who loves him -
the enormous shock of the launch will naturally wake the sleepers - and then mr windegger will take over the command
i am convinced that you won t let me down just as i haven t let you down
i shall wait calmly and with confidence that you ll come to get me

once upon a time
eight years later
around three o clock in the morning
sixteen years before
in the spring
be careful sterling don t let those javanese sell you any jungles for tea plantations
phyllis will you tell mother
tell mother
i ll write
isn t this romantic
it s going to be our second honeymoon
come and have a last look at san francisco
i live in the center of the largest tea district in java
since you are dealing in tea mr sterling why not make my home your headquarters
any big game in java
i ve always had a secret ambition to shoot a tiger
if you will honor my house with a visit i shall be happy to arrange a tiger hunt
that would be great
i ll tell mrs sterling
oh you are married
i d like you to meet my wife
dear i want you to meet prince de gace
i m sorry but this is very important
i ll be right back
will you have some thing to drink
i never drink
will you dance
i never dance
don t you like dancing
my wife loves to dance too
your country has always interested me with its worship of the great god business
the east is a country of the senses warm mysterious like the kiss of a lover
you are like the orchids of your country you have the same cold enchantment
in java the orchids grow wild and their perfume fills the air
and the women of java do they grow wild too
not wild but natural
they do not pretend to be cold
the heat the everlasting heat strips everyone of all pretense
it would be fascinating to learn whether your coldness is only a pretense
i am furious
the steward just told me my hunting outfit is not on board
don t worry mr sterling
i can supply you with hunting equipment
i am afraid of your prince
this gun business gets my goat
john didn t you notice anything strange in the prince s attitude toward me
there s something strange about all foreigners
he said i was like an orchid
he said java strips women of all pretense
and then he took me in his arms and kissed me
i had a terrible nightmare
- java- a land of magic beauty cursed with heat relentless heat
but you were just saying you wanted a nice cold drink
i won t accept anything from him
he s a fine chap what s the matter with him
i just don t like him
and i begged you not to accept his invitation
don t be unreasonable lillie
why don t you like him
you know i ve always wanted to shoot a tiger
it s the heat
it s just the heat dear
he says your beauty is more dazzling than the sun
reminds me of the army
your room
your personal maids
a little arrangement for lowering the temperature
good lord a double-bed
now mr sterling i will show you your room
your personal maids
pardon madame
dinner is at eight
what a fascinating costume
i trust madame has enjoyed the evening
what in heaven s name have you got on
you look silly dear take off that junk and go to bed
great eastern company about to bid tea propertiers you are interested
i advise close deals immediately
i ve got to cover six plantations it s no trip for you
why can t you stay here like a sensible woman
because i want to be with you
the prince is going with us
i think mrs sterling would enjoy it more if the top were down
you would have the top down
now i suppose you ll catch cold
top up now sir
we ll have to wait for mrs sterling
you can t travel in that condition
you ll have to stay here and we ll come back for you
but dear i don t want to stay here alone
i just told him if anything happened to mrs sterling i would cut his throat
your husband thought you would be safer if i remained with you
why have you shut yourself away from me all day
you were afraid afraid of yourself
you wanted to come out hours ago
where is mrs sterling
mrs sterling went to her room after supper
i thought you were never coming back
why are you so excited
i was so worried about you
have you lost anything
i just wanted to say good-night
then there is nothing to keep us in java any longer is there
i don t want to leave java until i ve killed my tiger
the jungle
my pipe
i must have left it in my hunting coat
did you find it
i have a head-ache i think i ll go to bed
did you hear that
did you ever try to get one at night
it s exciting enough by daylight on the back of an elephant
i am afraid he knows
don t be afraid
i ll see that he knows nothing
the tiger must be very near camp
i just heard him again
let s try to get a shot at him
this is ridiculous
i m going back
it s empty
you
what right had you to do this
what right had you to take it for granted i loved him was faithless to you

the devil s gonna sucker him into a deal and he ll be just as screwed as i am
what can you do

if somebody had stepped in before my parents sold my soul
whatever
devil says something about the soul eating after dark

i d be happy to help you
i won t need any help
you can always reach me at this address mademoiselle
- good evening officer - evening

a vaudeville actress probably just how do you figure that
we can t even remember a day
we call them suicide passengers
one-way ticket they never return
well the wanderer returns

- last night
alexander i d like you to meet an old friend of mine m la bessière
- a citizen of the world - very happy
- you re a frenchman aren t you
- yes - mrs marten
- aren t you the painter la bessière

he would be a great painter if he were not so rich
colonel buchard
- colonel
- charmed
- won t you join us
i d love to but isn t that césar and his wife
- yes
- see you later
it s awfully nice to see you in morocco again
- i m very happy to meet you even in this heat
- yes it is hot - and you mme césar
how have you been
- i ve been bored
we ve missed you
i feel greatly flattered
your rich friend is very democratic
he can afford to be
he s always chosen his own friends as a young vicar with the captain in the german air-force before joining the legion
- and perhaps you can give me the history of his wife
- the less said about that the better
the house is packed
the house is packed
this is a great night for you
if you make a hit you can stay here as long as you like
now you may have heard of me in europe or not
my house is patronized by the finest society in morocco
what was i going to say
oh yes
pick yourself a protector
it will give us prestige
an officer in the legion
they will tell you that the officers in the legion are not important that the common legionnaire is the thing
they will tell you that private so-and-so is a russian prince or an ex-general who joined the legion to forget his past
the private in the legion is a no bargain with 75 centimes per day don t believe it
thank you
pick the officers
they have the money
ladies and gentlemen
it is no small task as you know to supply my establishment with new talent
for some reason the artists i engage don t last very long
it may be the heat
i do my best
i pay the highest wages in africa mille grazie signore e signori
anyway i ll open the program tonight with mlle amy jolly a newcomer whom i hope you will receive with your usual discriminating kindness
if i remember correctly this audience shows its usual discriminating kindness by receiving its newcomers rather unpleasantly
sit down go ahead
may i offer you this glass of champagne
- may i have this
- of course
sing your number once and then sell the apples
that s the most important thing sell the apples
10 % is yours 90 % is mine
you ll make a fortune
yeah
over my dead body damme los flores or go a casa
well what s keeping you baby
what can i bid for my apple
the fruit that made adam so wise
on the historic night when he took a bite he discovered a new paradise
and apple they say keeps the doctor away while his pretty young wife has the time of her life
with the butcher the baker the candle-stick maker oh what can i bid for my apple
we meet once more monsieur
i didn t anticipate this pleasure so soon
can i also have an apple
- but i have no change for that
- i hardly expected you to have
you are again very kind
mademoiselle may i have the honour of your company after the performance
i m sorry i have disposed for the rest of the evening
- some other time perhaps
- of course
an apple monsieur
madame
don t waste your time down there
there s no money in the pit
isn t there
thanks for the flower mademoiselle
can i offer you an apple too
lend me 20 francs
that makes 60
two weeks pay is a lot of money for an apple
you can have it for nothing if you like
nothing doing
i always pay for what i get
i d sit down if i were you
you re pretty brave with women
what s the matter don t you like brave men perhaps
your change soldier
tom
well if it isn t mme césar
tom i must see you tonight
what do you mean tonight
what if your husband sees you tonight
he isn t going to see me isn t he
what if he does
césar s wife is above suspicion
you may know something about ancient history but i know something about husbands
it s you
what s the matter
were you expecting someone else
can i offer you something
cognac too hot
got any gin
yes
- cigarette - thanks
you made this place look very nice
it looks different now how do you know
have you been here before
well i have been stationed in this town for a long time
aren t you drinking
no
well to you
you can smell the desert tonight
hot isn t it
faded
you can go now soldier
you won t have any trouble getting rid of me nothing like independence isn t there
well maybe i am independent
with women
you evidently don t think much of women
i tell you lady it s their fault not mine
been in the legion very long
almost three years
three years seems like 300 you sound tired of life
i don t know whether i am or not
i was when i joined this outfit how about you mademoiselle
long enough
- tired of it - no
you ve a lot of pictures of that man is he your husband
husband
i never found a man good enough for that
that s just how i fell about women
how long ago was that picture taken
why
that looks like a russian sable
that coat s worth a load of shades do you still have it
don t be absurd
if i still had that coat i wouldn t be here
what in the name of ten thousand purples did you come to a country like this for anyway
i understand that men are never asked why they enter the foreign legion that s right
they never asked me and if they had i wouldn t have told
when i crashed the legion i ditched the past
there s a foreign legion of women too
but we have no uniforms no flags
and no medals when we are brave
no wound stripes when we are hurt
look here is there anything i can do to help you
no
i ve heard that before
or do you think you can restore my faith in men
not me you ve got the wrong man for that
anybody who has faith in me is a sucker
you d better go now
i m beginning like you
i ve said to women about everything a man can say
i m gonna to tell you something i ve never told a woman before
i wish i d met you 10 years ago
- good night
- good night
and thanks
well the night s still young
there s your key lady if i were you i wouldn t hand it around
i hear something
taking a walk
to get some fresh air
no i was looking for you
it s good that you found me
this quarter isn t safe at night
i d better take you home
- 120
- no i wish i were
i only feel so light to you because your arms are so powerful
well we ll get along a bit better this time
look out
you d better come here there s gonna be trouble
i give you one more chance
who were those two women
get your knee out of my hip
do you think the two women you are trying to protect are worth it
well i think one of them is
mon adjudant m la bessière is here to take you to his club
ask him to wait
i ll be through in a minute
no let him come in
- i didn t know that the military was quite so busy
- oh yes we are busy
sit down
perhaps you can learn something about this country which you think is so marvellous
got a match
this little matter also involves someone you re interested in
i m properly curious bring in that woman
mademoiselle i think you know m la bessière
- very happy to meet you again mademoiselle
- sit down
i m happy to meet you again
it s so nice of you to have come mademoiselle
you were present at this affair at which the prisoner with his customary bravery severely wounded two helpless natives
those natives were not helpless
they attacked us
who was the other woman
i don t know
i d like to know too
do sit down
the curious part of this is i m the only one that really seems to know who this other woman is
if you do know you d better keep it to yourself
captain césar don t lose your temper
return the prisoner to the guard-house
i appreciate your attempt to keep the name of my wife out of this
that s alright sir
you may go now mademoiselle
i ll join you in a minute
you look charming this morning
what will they do to him
i don t know
personally i shouldn t care to have adjudant césar as an enemy
i seem to have the unhappy faculty of bringing trouble wherever i go
nonsense you know i carry some weight with césar
possibly i can help you
every time a man has helped me there s been a price
what s yours
my price
a smile
i haven t got much more
shall we go
here take your pass you re a free man
door s right open and you can do what you like til 7 o clock in the morning
- what s the idea of all this
- you re leaving for amalfa-pass tomorrow - not me i m beginning to like this town
tell césar i m not going you tell him yourself he s going along this time
- who s going along
- you heard what i said césar is going along this time
so that s what it is that s why he didn t recommend a court martial
he s gonna get me out on the road and face me in the proper direction
well you got a gun with you haven t you
you can t get away with murder all your life that s right sergeant
your argument is perfectly sound but nobody is gonna use me for target practice
i m through with the army anyway
i ve been looking for the right kind of woman all my life and i think i ve found her
so i quit take this thing and spend a few weeks somewhere along the blue mediterranean so you re quitting eh
well nobody s stopping you
by the way you happen to remember what the penalty is for desertion
there s a 100 ways to dying brother and i m picking my own way
go on get out of here
he s in there
i ve never known such a fortune in my life
he s a rich man to buy morocco
don t forget me you ve met him in my theatre
good evening
your flowers are wonderful any news of him
i did what i could
they will not court-martial him
they re going to transfer him which means of course that he will have to leave town
do you love him
i don t know
i hope not
i can t accept this
it s worth a fortune
anything of less value would be unworthy
i ve got to change
i d like to take you away from here
would you
exactly what do you offer now
the conventional thing
my offer is highly respectable
marriage
you re a strange man
do you find it so strange that i shall be fond of you
must i answer you now
i d sleep better tonight if you did
i don t think i care to take advantage of your tempting offer
- then you re in love
- no i don t think i am
supposing you had never met a certain private in the foreign legion what would your answer have been
might have been the same
i don t know
i m sorry to intrude but i m leaving for the sahara in the morning and i just came to say good-bye
i think you two want to be alone
i understand you are leaving on a rather strenuous journey
- may i wish you good luck - thanks
- à bientot mademoiselle - à bientot
will you be gone long
when will i see you again
maybe never
something tells me i m not coming back this time

that s just what i was thinking
i could desert and board a freighter for europe tonight
why don t you
i would in a minute if you d go with me
will you
yes
i ll be back wait for me
if you can spare one of your hands i would like to say goodbye too
goodbye mademoiselle
why didn t you stay last night
i had a few other calls to make
who are those women those women
i would call them the rear-guard
how can they keep feet with the men
they catch up with them and sometimes they don t
and very often when they do they find their men dead
those women must be mad
i don t know
you see they love their men
i don t see why we have to keep getting down all day we only have to get up again

goodbye sir
the scorpion is an arachoid species found in various parts of the world
its tail comprises five prismatic joints
the pincers recalling those of the larger crayfsh are instruments of aggression and information
its tail ends in a sixth joint a sac from which poison is injected by barbed sting
a lover of darkness it burrows under stones to escape the glare of the sun
antisocial it ejects the intruder on its solitude
such lightning strikes such virtuosity in attack
even a rat for all its fury falls prey to it
some hours later
stop it
perhaps i just happened to fall
no we saw nothing
is there any news yes or no
yes the majorcans are here
quick to arms
to the rear
what about péman
i m done for
so are we but we re going
yes but you ve got accordions hippopotamuses wrenches mountain goats and
bollocks
let s go and paintbrushes
this stone on the site where the majorcans died marks the founding of the city of imperial rome
once mistress of the pagan world now secular seat of the church
aspects of its stoutest pillar the vatican
the landlord s terms are very favourable
we can move in at once
longing to see you very soon now
your loving cousin
but the hurly-burly of modern life has overtaken the imperial city
sometimes on sundays
various picturesque aspects of the great city
bandaged
yes it s been sore for over a week ls daddy home yet mummy
yes he s in the dispensary
then he ll dress for the party
we went out together this morning and engaged four of them
the little moustached one sang like the rest
only a pianist is lacking
but our priest is a fine violinist i think the musicians we have will be enough
six of them placed near the microphone will make more noise than sixty ten kilometres away i know sound gets lost in the open air but we could bring the guests in close
get a move on the majorcans will be arriving at nine
bastard
filthy swine
keep your trap shut
want us to work you over
here s a taste of the rough stuff
enough is enough
let me show you who you re dealing with
let s have a look then
the international goodwill society hereby appoints you its special delegate
this document testifies to our faith in you
we pray that you will prove worthy of this trust we place in you and successfully complete your goodwill mission
on your spirit of self-sacrifice and your proven valour depend many lives
children women old men the honour of our fatherland rests on the outcome of this noble enterprise
at his magnificent roman estate the marquis of x prepares for his guests
the minister of the lnterior is on the telephone
you scoundrel
you are entirely to blame
you compromised me too
do you realize that not one child survived
many women and old men perished too
you re bothering me about a few brats
filthy ruffian you ve dragged me down with you
dishonoured me
you can die for all i care
then listen to my last words
has he gone
are you sleepy
i was just falling asleep
where s the light switch
at the foot of the bed
your elbow s hurting me
move your head closer the pillow is cooler on this side
where s your hand
that feels so good
let s just sit here and not move
are you cold
no i was falling
i ve been waiting so long for him
what joy what joy in having killed our children
my love my love
just as these feathers fell but a long way away the survivors from the château de selliny emerged to return to paris
120 days earlier four godless and unprincipled scoundrels had driven by their depravity shut themselves away to indulge in the most bestial of orgies
to them the life of a woman mattered no more than that of a fly
they took with them eight lovely adolescent girls to serve as victims for their criminal desires plus four women well versed in debauchery whose narrative skills would serve to stimulate their already jaded appetites whenever interest flagged
here are the survivors of these orgies leaving the château de selliny
first and foremost of the four instigators the duc de blangis

listen little caesar has never been found
according to the statement of lieutenant thomas flaherty of the homicide squad little caesar the once swaggering braggart of the underworld wilted in the face of real danger and showed the world his cowardice
flaherty stated further that little caesar has contradicted his oft-repeated boast that he could dish it out and take it too
yeah
when a real crisis arose rico couldn t take it
flaherty ended his interview by remarking
meteoric as was rico s rise from the gutter it was inevitable that he should return there
well just the same he was the real leader of that gang

rico didn t have the nerve and he didn t have the brains
he was yellow just like flaherty said

you

yes i can see now
the end
among the rugged peaks that frown down upon the borgo pass are found crumbling castles of a bygone age
i say driver a bit slower
no no
we must reach the inn before sundown
and why pray
it is walpurgis night the night of evil
nosferatu
on this night madam the doors they are barred and to the virgin we pray
i say porter
don t take my luggage down
i m going on to borgo pass tonight
no no please
put that back up there
the driver he is afraid
walpurgis night
good fellow he is
he wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise
well i m sorry but there s a carriage meeting me at borgo pass at midnight
borgo pass
yes whose carriage
count dracula s
count dracula s
yes
castle dracula
yes that s where i m going
to the castle
yes
no
you mustn t go there
we people of the mountains believe at the castle there are vampires
dracula and his wives
they take the form of wolves and bats
they leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living
oh but that s all superstition
why i can t understand why
look the sun
when it is gone they leave their coffins
come
we must go indoors
but wait
i mean just a minute i
what i m trying to say is that i m not afraid
i ve explained to the driver that it s a matter of business with me
i ve got to go
really
well good night
wait
please
if you must go wear this for your mother s sake
it will protect you
the coach from count dracula
hey driver
i say driver what do you mean by going at this
i am dracula
it s really good to see you
i don t know what happened to the driver and my luggage and
well and with all this i thought i was in the wrong place
i bid you welcome
listen to them
children of the night
what music they make
the spider spinning his web for the unwary fly
the blood is the life mr renfield
why
yes
i m sure you will find this part of my castle more inviting
well rather
it s quite different from outside
oh and the fire it s so cheerful
i didn t know but that you might be hungry
thank you that s very kind of you but i m a bit worried about my luggage
you see all your papers were in
i took the liberty of having your luggage brought up
allow me oh yes
thanks
i trust you have kept your coming here a secret
i ve followed your instructions implicitly
excellent mr renfield
excellent
and now if you re not too fatigued i would like to discuss the lease on carfax abbey
oh yes
everything is in order awaiting your signature
well here
here s the lease
why i hope i ve brought enough labels for your luggage
i m taking with me only three boxes
very well
i have chartered a ship to take us to england
we will be leaving tomorrow evening
everything will be ready
i hope you will find this comfortable
thanks
it looks very inviting ouch
oh it s nothing serious
just a small cut from that paper clip
it s just a scratch
this is very old wine
i hope you will like it
aren t you drinking
i never drink wine
well
it s delicious
and now i ll leave you
well good night
good night mr renfield
master the sun is gone
you will keep your promise when we get to london won t you master
you will see that i get lives
not human lives but small ones with blood in them
i ll be loyal to you master
i ll be loyal
must be a scandinavian ship that s what it looks to me like
here now here now get back
nobody goes aboard this here boat but the authorities
the captain dead tied to the wheel
horrible tragedy horrible tragedy
master we re here
you can t hear what i m saying but we re here
we re safe
they must have come through a terrible storm
what s that
why it s come from that hatchway
why he s mad
look at his eyes
why the man s gone crazy
violets
violets flower for your buttonhole sir
flower for your buttonhole sir flower for your buttonhole sir
flower for your buttonhole
here s a nice one
and after you deliver the message you will remember nothing i now say
obey
dr seward yes
you re wanted on the telephone
thank you
well excuse me dear
oh father if it s from home will you say i m spending the night in town with lucy
all right dear pardon me
yes
i could not help overhearing your name
might i inquire if you are the dr seward whose sanitarium is at whitby
why yes
i m count dracula
i have just leased carfax abbey
i understand it adjoins your grounds
why yes it does
i m very happy to make your acquaintance
may i present my daughter mina count dracula
miss weston
how do you do
and mr harker
how do you do
count dracula s just taken carfax abbey
oh it ll be a relief to see light in those dismal old windows
it will indeed
you ll excuse me i m wanted on the telephone
the abbey could be very attractive but i should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs
i shall do very little repairing
it reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in transylvania
the abbey always reminds me of that old toast about lofty timbers
the walls around are bare echoing to our laughter as though the dead were there
nice little sentiment
but there s more even nicer
pass a cup to the dead already a round for the next to die
oh never mind the rest dear
to die to be really dead that must be glorious
why count dracula
there are far worse things awaiting man than death
it reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in transylvania oh lucy
you re so romantic
laugh all you like
i think he s fascinating
i suppose he s all right
but give me someone a little more normal
like john
yes dear like john castle
dracula transylvania
well countess
i ll leave you to your count and his ruined abbey
good night lucy good night dear
the fog seems to be closing down a bit sir
another death dead
dr seward when did miss weston have the last transfusion about four hours ago
an unnatural loss of blood which we ve been powerless to check
on the throat of each victim the same two marks
he probably wants his flies again no martin please
please don t martin
oh martin please
please martin
no martin
oh martin please
here give it to me now
no no no martin please no martin
martin don t
don t throw my spider away from me
oh martin no
ain t you ashamed now ain t you spiders now is it
flies ain t good enough
flies
flies
poor puny things
who wants to eat flies
you do you loony
not when i can get nice fat spiders
all right have it your own way
read dummkopf where i have marked
gentlemen we are dealing with the undead nosferatu
yes nosferatu the undead the vampire
the vampire attacks the throat
it leaves two little wounds white with red centers
dr seward your patient renfield whose blood i have just analyzed is obsessed with the idea that he must devour living things in order to sustain his own life
but professor van helsing modern medical science does not admit of such a creature the vampire is a pure myth superstition
i may be able to bring you proof that the superstition of yesterday can become the scientific reality of today
but professor renfield s cravings have always been for small living things nothing human
as far as we know doctor
but you tell me that he escapes from his room
he is gone for hours
where does he go
well mr renfield you are looking much better than you did this morning when i arrived
thanks i m feeling much better
i am here to help you you understand that do you not
why of course
and i m very grateful
keep your filthy hands to yourself now now renfield
oh dr seward send me away from this place send me far away
why are you so anxious to get away
my cries at night they might disturb miss mina yes
they might give her bad dreams professor van helsing
bad dreams
that sounded like a wolf yes it did
but i hardly think there are wolves so near london
he thinks they re wolves
me i ve heard them howl at night before
he thinks they re talking to him
he howls and howls back at them
he s crazy
i might have known i might have known
we know why the wolves talk do we not mr renfield
and we know how we can make them stop
you know too much to live van helsing now now renfield
we ll get no more out of him now for a while take him away martin
on your way old fly eater
i m warning you dr seward
if you don t send me away you must answer for what will happen to miss mina all right martin
come along now come along
what was that herb that excited him so
wolfsbane
it is a plant that grows in central europe
the natives there use it to protect themselves against vampires
renfield reacted very violently to its scent
seward i want you to have renfield closely watched by day and night especially by night
yes master
master you ve come back
no master please please don t ask me to do that
don t not her
please don t master don t please
please
oh don t
i lay in bed for quite a while reading and just as i was commencing to get drowsy
i heard dogs howling
and when the dream came it seemed the whole room was filled with mist
it was so thick i could just see the lamp by the bed a tiny spark in the fog
and then i saw two red eyes staring at me and a white livid face came down out of the mist
it came closer and closer
i felt its breath on my face and then its lips
dear it was only a dream and then in the morning i felt so weak
it seemed as if all the life had been drained out of me
darling we re going to forget all about these dreams think about something cheerful aren t we
allow me oh certainly professor
think for a moment
is there anything that might have brought this dream on
doctor there s something troubling mina something she won t tell us
and the face in the dream you say it seemed to come closer and closer the lips touched you
where is there anything the matter with your throat
oh no but i permit me
no please
yes yes
how long have you had those little marks marks
please
mina why didn t you let us know do not excite her
when miss mina
since the morning after the dream what could have caused them professor
count dracula
it s good to see you back again doctor i heard you have just arrived
and you miss mina you re looking exceptionally
pardon me dr seward but i think miss mina should go to her room at once
i don t believe it s as important as you seem to think it is
excuse me
count dracula professor van helsing
a most distinguished scientist whose name we know even in the wilds of transylvania
i had a frightful dream a few nights ago and i don t seem to be able to get it out of my mind i hope you haven t taken my stories too seriously
stories
yes
in my humble effort to amuse your fiancÃ © e mr harker
i was telling her some rather grim tales of my far-off country
why john
i can quite understand mr harker s concern
i m afraid it s quite serious
my dear i m sure count dracula will excuse you
you must go to your room as professor van helsing suggests
oh but really father i m feeling quite well you had better do as your father advises
very well
good night john
may i call later and inquire how you re feeling
why yes
thank you
my visit was so ill-timed not at all
on the contrary it may prove to be most enlightening
in fact before you go you can be of definite service
anything i can do
gladly
i stumbled upon a most amazing phenomenon something so incredible i mistrust my own judgment look
dr seward my humble apology i dislike mirrors
van helsing will explain
for one who has not lived even a single lifetime you are a wise man van helsing whew
what on earth caused that did you see the look on his face
like a wild animal wild animal
like a madman
what s that running across the lawn looks like a huge dog
or a wolf
he was afraid we might follow
follow
sometimes they take the form of wolves but generally of bats
what are you talking about dracula
but what s dracula got to do with wolves and bats
dracula is our vampire
but surely professor a vampire casts no reflection in the glass
that is why dracula smashed the mirror
i don t mean to be rude but that s the sort of thing i d expect one of the patients here to say
yes and that is what your english doctors would say your police
the strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him
professor vampires only exist in ghost stories
a vampire mr harker is a being that lives after its death by drinking the blood of the living
it must have blood or it dies its power lasts only from sunset to sunrise
during the hours of the day it must rest in the earth in which it was buried
but then if dracula were a vampire he d have to return every night to transylvania and that s impossible
then he must have brought his native soil with him boxes of it
boxes of earth large enough for him to rest in renfield
what are you doing there
come here
did you hear what we were saying yes i heard something
enough
be guided by what he says
it s your only hope
i begged you to send me away but you wouldn t
now it s too late
it s happened again
what s happened
take her away from here take her away before
no no master i wasn t going to say anything
i told them nothing
i m loyal to you master
what have you to do with dracula
dracula
i never even heard the name before
you will die in torment if you die with innocent blood on your soul oh no
god will not damn a lunatic s soul
he knows that the powers of evil are too great for those of us with weak minds
oh mr harker
mr harker it s horrible
oh it s horrible dr seward
miss mina out there dead
where where
out there
thank heaven for that
alive yes but in greater danger for she s already under his influence it s horrible van helsing horrible
incredible incredible perhaps but a fact
we must face it we must cope with it
further attacks on small children committed after dark by the mysterious woman in white took place last night
narratives of two small girls each child describing a beautiful lady in white who promised her chocolates enticed her to a secluded spot
vampires
and then miss mina
well how could she know anything about the woman in white it s bad enough for her to read it in the newspaper
please please mr harker
and when was the next time you saw miss lucy after she was buried
i was downstairs on the terrace she came out of the shadows and stood looking at me i started to speak to her
the most horrible expression came over her face
she looked like a hungry animal
a wolf
and then she turned and ran back into the dark
then you know the woman in white is lucy
miss mina
i promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest her soul released from this horror
if you can save lucy s soul after death promise me you ll save mine darling you re not going to die you re going to live
no john you mustn t touch me
and you mustn t kiss me ever again
what are you trying to say
you make him understand
i can t
our love our life together
oh no
no no donâ € ™ t look at me like that i love you john
you
but this horror he wills it miss mina you must come indoors
you must
you re driving her crazy
mr harker that is what you should be worrying about
the last rays of the day s sun will soon be gone and another night will be upon us
dr seward i m taking mina with me to london tonight or i ll call in the police but john
mina please get your bags packed
seward i must be master here or i can do nothing
right
miss mina both this room and your bedroom have been prepared with wolfsbane
you will be safe if dracula returns she ll be safe all right because she s going with me
mina i ll be waiting for you in the library
oh john
father talk to him
please don t let him go
oh briggs -
miss mina is to wear this wreath of wolfsbane when she goes to bed
watch her closely and see that she does not remove it in her sleep i understand professor
and under no circumstances must these windows be opened tonight
very well sir
you will recollect that dracula cast no reflection in the mirror
yes and that three boxes of earth were delivered to him at carfax abbey
quite
and knowing that a vampire must rest by day in his native soil
i am convinced that this dracula is no legend but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged
well dr seward what about it
is mina going with me or not
if you take her from under our protection you will kill her
now john please please be patient
mr harker please come here
well
john i know you love her but don t forget she s my daughter and i must do what i think is best
mr harker
i have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things little-known facts which the world is perhaps better off not knowing
i know but professor all i want is to get mina away from all of this
that will do no good
our only chance of saving miss mina s life is to find the hiding place of dracula s living corpse and to drive a stake through its heart
isn t this a strange conversation for men who aren t crazy
renfield you re compelling me to put you in a straitjacket
you forget doctor that madmen have great strength
dracula has great strength eh renfield
words words words
oh martin didn t i warn you to keep a strict watch
what
what again
yes sir
at once sir
yes sir
right away sir
here the doctor s pet loony is loose again
he came and stood below my window in the moonlight
and he promised me things
not in words but by doing them
doing them
by making them happen
a red mist spread over the lawn coming on like a flame of fire
and then he parted it
and i could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red like his only smaller
and then he held up his hand and they all stopped
and i thought he seemed to be saying
rats
rats
rats
thousands millions of them
all red blood all these will i give you if you will obey me
what did he want you to do
that which has already been done
strike me down dead doctor
he s got me going now he s twisted and broken them iron bars as if they was cheese
dracula is in the house
in the house
doctor this time he can do no harm
we are ready for him
martin come with me
i ll show you where we can put mr renfield where he won t escape again
all right but i have me doubts
come along old fly eater
now you mustn t get out of it this time
i m awfully sorry to have to look you up but you ve got to stay in your room
van helsing
now that you have learned what you have learned it would be well for you to return to your own country
i prefer to remain and protect those whom you would destroy
you are too late
my blood now flows through her veins
she will live through the centuries to come as i have lived
should you escape us dracula we know how to save miss mina s soul if not her life
if she dies by day
but i shall see that she dies by night
and i will have carfax abbey torn down stone by stone excavated a mile around
i will find your earth box and drive that stake through your heart
come here
come here
your will is strong
van helsing
more wolfsbane
more effective than wolfsbane count
indeed
open the windows briggs and let in some air
the odor in the room from that horrible weed is stifling i can t stand it
but the professor gave orders
oh never mind the professor now
now please go back to bed at once i m going to call your father
what is it briggs
oh i don t know mr harker
i felt strangely dizzy
and when it cleared away
miss mina was up and dressed and out on the terrace
and i can t get her to go to bed
well let me see her
tell her i m here john
oh john i m so glad you re here
well what have they been doing to me dear
locking me in my room
and the horrible smell of that awful weed
it s been like a nightmare
what s been the matter
why are you looking at me like that
mina
you re so like a changed girl
oh you look wonderful
i feel wonderful
i ve never felt better in my life
oh i m so glad to see you like this
i ve been awfully worried about you
mr harker
you better bring miss mina inside
that s all right briggs now that i m here
run along briggs don t worry
john look the fog s lifting
see how plain you can see the stars
yes
millions of them i ve never seen them so close
why it looks as if you could reach out and touch them
would you like me to get you a hat
why what s the matter
oh nothing nothing at all
come
let s sit down
van helsing
seward that which i feared from the beginning has happened
what
dracula boasts that he has fused his blood with that of miss mina
in life she will now become the foul thing of the night that he is
but van helsing
no no come seward
come there s not a moment to be lost
oh but i love the fog i love nights with fog
but only yesterday you said you were afraid of the night
but darling i could never have said anything so silly
i couldn t i love the night
that s the only time i feel really alive
there s that bat again
yes
look out
he ll get in your hair
yes
my that was a big bat
i will
you will what
oh i didn t say anything
yes you did you said i will
oh no i didn t
john come sit down
there must be some way some way to save her
- there is only one - john
that funny little old professor he has a crucifix
now i want you to get it away from him and hide it
but why dear

well i don t know
he may be right mina
your eyes
they look at me so strangely
mina
mina you re

what s the idea have you gone crazy
what are you trying to do frighten her to death
no i was trying to save her

that s a fine way
it s all right darling
oh john darling you must go away from me
the cross put it away
after what s happened i can t bear to look at it

i can t tell you i can t
ah but you must you must tell me
i have a right to know
oh john
you can believe everything he says it s all the truth
dracula he

well what s he done to you dearie tell me
he came to me
he opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink
what is it who is it martin
it s that big gray bat again sir
it s no use of wasting your bullets martin
they cannot harm that bat
no sir
he s crazy
they re all crazy
they re all crazy except you and me
sometimes i have me doubts about you

dracula is dead forever

the three penny opera had its film premiere in berlin on february 19 1931
it was restored in 2006 for the film s 75th anniversary from the original negative in the german federal film archives
you gents who to a virtuous life would lead us
and turn us from all wrongdoing and sin
first of all see to it that you feed us
then start your preaching that s where to begin
the threepenny opera
all you who love your paunch and our propriety
there s one thing you must finally realize
no matter how you try to twist and turn it
first comes the grub then you can moralize
there must first be a chance for all now poorly fed to get their slice of life s great loaf of bread
how does a man survive
how does a man survive by daily cheating
mistreating beating others spitting in their face
only that man survives who s able to forget
that he s a member of the human race
gentlemen this truth you cannot shirk
man lives exclusively by dirty work
mackie
the shark has teeth
there they are for all to see
but the knife that macheath carries
no one knows where it may be
on a blue and balmy sunday
on the strand a man s lost his life
a man darts round the corner
people call him mack the knife
and schmul meier is still missing
one more wealthy man removed
somehow mackie has his money
and yet nothing can be proved
jenny towler was discovered
with a knife stuck in her chest
mackie strolls along the dockside
knows no more than all the rest
seven children and an old man
burned alive in old soho
in the crowd stands mack the knife
who s not asked and doesn t know
and the widow not yet twenty
she whose name all could say
defiled one night as she lay sleeping
mackie what price did you pay
defiled one night as she lay sleeping
mackie what price did you pay

last wednesday man and wife became
as they stood side by side at city hall he wondered where she got the gown and all while she wasn t too sure of his name
you see the moon over soho
i see it dearest
do you feel my heart beating my beloved
i feel it my darling
wherever you go i too shall go
and wherever you are i want to be too
and though there s no license from city hall
and no altar covered with flowers fair
and though you may not know where your gown came from
and there s no myrtle in your hair
take the plate on which you eat your bread
don t look at it for long fling it far
love lasts forever or else not at all no matter where we are
no no stay a while reverend
attention everyone
it s ten past 2 00
hip hip hurray
- congratulations polly
- congratulations captain
congratulations
well you didn t make much of an effort
champagne in wine glasses
junk
it s lovely
is all this stolen too mackie
of course
pity we don t have our own place for these nice things
this is pathetic
all scotland yard was out and about
and where s the grandfather clock
no grandfather clock
pathetic
my wife is beside herself
what bunglers
i m getting married for once how often does that happen
reverend
i m so happy you could be here on the happiest day of our lives
reverend this is miss peachum who loves me and wishes to share her life with me
congratulations polly
congratulations captain
reverend
won t you honor us by staying
i ve got a christening
hopefully we ll need you for that pretty quick too
shut up
no dirty jokes in the presence of a lady
and where s that grandfather clock
where s the grandfather clock
accompany the reverend
i do apologize reverend
this area s not very safe
this way vicar
careful
sorry
i would have preferred it if you hadn t all rushed to the trough
we could have used a little entertainment
i m hungry mackie
other people always manage that on these occasions
will none of you oblige
is anyone watching at the door
must i see to everything myself
gentlemen if none of you will oblige
i ll offer up a little song myself
i once thought in my innocent youth
and i once was as innocent as you
perhaps i too would have a suitor one day
then i must know what to do
and if he s rich and if he s nice
and if his collar is white as snow
and if he knows how to treat a lady
then i shall tell him no
then you hold your head up high
and don t let your feelings show
sure the moon will shine all night
but the boat on the river will stay tied up tight
that s as far as you can go
oh you can t simply lie back
you must be cold and heartless as you know
or else all sorts of things could happen
yes there s just one answer - no
the first to come along was a man from kent
he was all that a man should be
the second had three ships in the harbor
and the third was mad about me
and they had money and they were nice
and their collars were white as snow
and they knew how to treat a lady
so i had to tell them
no
i held my head up high
didn t let my feelings show
sure the moon shone all night
but the boat on the river stayed tied up tight
that s as far as things could go
oh you can t simply lie back
you must be cold and heartless as you know
or else all sorts of things could happen
yes there s just one answer
no
but then one day when the sky was blue
came a man who didn t bother wooing
he tossed his hat on the peg in my room
and i no longer knew what i was doing
since he had no money and he wasn t nice
and his collar wasn t white as snow
since he didn t know how to treat a lady
i couldn t tell him no
i no longer held my head up high
and i let my feelings show
oh the moon shone as before
but the boat cast loose and drifted from the shore
that s just how it had to go
oh then you must simply lie back
oh you can t be cold and heartless you know
oh it simply had to happen
there was no such word as
no
very nice
funny
the missus can sure sing a song
very nice
it wasn t nice you idiots
it s not nice it s art
that was wonderful polly
too good for this trash
bad news
it s the sheriff himself
hello jackie

it s all taken care of
good-bye mackie
what an awful ladder
perhaps next time you might choose a nicer warehouse
- so that was tiger brown
- yes
we have connections with the highest authorities
captain now comes the best part
- what is it
- another little surprise
bill lawgen and mary syer
last wednesday man and wife became
three cheers for the happy couple
as they stood side by side at city hall
he wondered where she got the gown and all
while she wasn t too sure of his name
you ve seen the courtship and marriage of polly peachum
now i ll show you the power of the beggar king or as he calls himself
the poorest man in london
anyone wishing to take up a beggar s trade in london must have a license from jonathan jeremiah peachum co
twenty schillings
ten mr peachum
twenty and 50 % of your weekly earnings
but mr peachum
i have nothing
mrs peachum
number 314
baker street district
get him some clothes outfit c
come along shorty
my earnings
what are those
the five basic types of misery guaranteed to move the human heart and induce in a man that unnatural state in which he willingly parts with his money
outfit c
- can t i have outfit a
- no
that s the young man of good family who s seen better days
but i ve seen better days myself
no one will believe your real suffering complain of a real stomachache and you ll only annoy them
enough questions just get dressed
please forgive me
hurry it up shorty
i can t stand here holding your trousers till christmas
next
p-p-please i have money for a new co-co-co -
polly
tell polly to come down right away
how many times have i told you that a gentleman must have freshly laundered rags
holes are to be burned in and stains made with candle wax those with means to pay are entitled to a uniform that ensures the pity of their clients
what s that
your share of my take
- is that all
- with this stump
i m lodging a complaint
this place is a pigsty and this is a lousy stump
there my friend now you can go work for a living
mr peachum
thugs
thieves
next please
a new co-co-costume
where s polly
i ll get her myself
let her sleep
- sleep
at this hour
- dear god
polly didn t come home
good morning
g-g-good m-m-morning
what
a cane with an ivory handle
mack the knife
dear god
good morning
crook s trollop
help me undress
you ll divorce him
i love him
how can i divorce him
i ll tan your behind
it won t do any good
love is greater than a tanned behind
that s what we get for spoiling her with dresses hats gloves and parasols
mack the knife
my honest business and a common crook
hanging him s the only solution
hanging him
you and your ideas
turn him in to the police
- i don t know where he is
where
with his whores in turnbridge alley
i m very sorry but there s nothing the police can do
really
there s nothing the police can do
then what s going to happen to you will be a horrible injustice
me
how so
how so
if you don t catch mack the knife and hang him there ll be a scandal at the queen s coronation that will cost you your job
an army of filthy beggars will march up to greet the queen when they gather before the church by the thousands it won t be a festive sight
they re not an attractive crowd
not an attractive crowd eh
well i ll have them run off i ll force them to -
how will it look at the coronation if 2 000 poor cripples must be beaten to the ground
it will look very bad mr brown
a revolting sight
you re you re threatening me
this is blackmail
i ll have you taken away mr peachum
where s my bell
i ll call to have you taken away if you re ever so impertinent again
i m no criminal
i m just a poor man mr brown
look here mr peachum
we re all poor men here
come my dear poor mr peachum
i m sure you understand you can only hang a man if you have the man
you can only arrest a man if you have him
i can tell you where he is
a mother-in-law ought to know where her son-in-law can be arrested
with the ladies in turnbridge alley
the whores in turnbridge alley
what s that
a man lives by his head
he needs a larger size
just try it for yourself your head
won t feed a pair of lice
you see for this existence
man is never sharp enough
hence his weak resistance
to its tricks and bluff
so make your little plan
yes be a shining light
then make yourself a second plan
none will turn out right
you see for this existence
there s no man who s bad enough
still it s nice to watch them
trying to be tough
sure chase your bit of luck
but no need to run fast
though men always race after it
luck always runs last
you see for this existence
man s demands are just too tough
all his noisy striving
is self-deluding guff
item no 8
regarding the safes on oak street only cash is to be taken
no securities
yeah we re not getting involved in stock fraud
jimmy two will take command of the explosives convoy
if he s bumped off no great loss
he doesn t bring much in anymore
you re one to talk
just a minute
three four five gold watches was your take this month
not much
item no 9
time of the burglary
8 30 during the coronation celebration
- guards will all be at the ceremony
- and all plastered
the job s a cinch
mackie
what s the matter
- you must pack right away
- nonsense
what s the matter
you must leave immediately
i went to see tiger brown and my father was there too
they plan to arrest you
you must pack immediately
nonsense
come here polly
there s something i d rather do than pack
no mackie not now
brown stood up for you at first but then he gave in
now he says to tell you -
- what
there s nothing more he can do for you
come now
i can trust brown implicitly
scotland yard has nothing on me
maybe they didn t yesterday but today they ve suddenly got a whole lot on you
in winchester you seduced two sisters both of them minors
they told me they were over 30
both of them together
your father s a fine one
is this the thanks i get for marrying his daughter
very well
if i must go you ll have to take over running the business
gentlemen
i must unfortunately take a little trip
now with the coronation coming up
without you it s like soup without a spoon
i m therefore temporarily entrusting management of the business to my wife
what
a woman
what about the big bank job
shut your trap
now if the bank job goes well then it s no more picking pockets and street muggings
it s good-bye to soho and hello to the big city
good-bye you poor fools
good-bye captain
mackie don t tear my heart out
stay here with me and let s be happy
i m tearing my own heart out because i must go away and no one knows when i ll return
it lasted so short a time
is it over then
don t forget me mackie in foreign parts
i won t forget you polly
kiss me polly
and don t go to those ladies in turnbridge
i love only you
farewell polly
farewell mackie
i m in charge now
gentlemen
i think our captain can depart in full confidence
we ll pull off that job just fine won t we gentlemen
in first-class style
isn t that right gentlemen
well it s not for me to say but i m not sure that at a time like this a woman is the right man
nothing personal ma am
the swine
you bet it was nothing personal
or else the others would have tanned your hide
right gentlemen
nothing personal of course
she packs a punch believe me
splendid
our lady captain knows how to find the right word
bravo polly
from now on we ll settle accounts every thursday gentlemen
dismissed
jenny there s someone here to see you
- isn t that lovely
- the queen s coronation gown
it cost 7 000 pounds
imagine the fine underwear a queen can afford
why would a queen need fine underwear anyway
i wonder if mackie will come by today
i don t think he ll ever be back
wanted £ 100 reward for mack the knife
he took away my daughter
married her he did
married her
last night married her good and proper
i see
so if he comes here today will you signal from the window
hey there my coffee
i ll signal
good heavens mackie
what are you doing here
quickly now
mon café
- haven t you seen the wanted posters
- yes i know
but thursday s my day here
i can t let such trifles disturb my routine
hello mackie
congratulations on your marriage
too bad you missed it
it was a-1
jenny come join us
yes jenny come on
jenny read his palm
jenny why that look
just good news please
nothing bad
mackie when the coronation bells ring at westminster you ll be in a bad way
my hat and cane
i m going
my jacket
- stay mackie
- who knows when you ll be back
you can count on it
gents you see me washing the glasses
and making your beds without squawking
and you tip me a penny and i thank you well
and you see my dirty rags in this ratty old hotel
and you don t know to whom you re talking
but one day there ll be a shout at the dock
and they ll ask what was that shout
and they ll see me smiling as i wash my glasses
and they ll ask what s she smiling about
and a ship with eight sails and 50 cannon
will be at the quay
gentlemen your laughter will quickly stop
as walls tumble down everywhere
the third day will see the town razed to the ground
just one ratty old hotel will survive safe and sound
and they ll ask who s so special that lives there
and that night a cry will go up around the hotel
folks will ask why was this hotel spared
and at dawn they ll see me coming through the doorway
and they ll say so she lived in there
and a ship with eight sails and 50 cannon
will lay siege to the town
a hundred men will land in the bright midday sun
and stealthily step through the shadows
they ll enter every doorway grab every man they see
and clap them in chains and bring them to me
and ask me which shall we kill
and ask me which shall we kill
that noon there ll be quiet in the harbor
as they ask me who is to die
and then they ll hear my reply
all of em
and as each head falls i ll say
hoppla
and the ship with eight sails and 50 cannon
will vanish with me
jenny you remember the days before my star rose over this town
even though i m now mack the knife i ll never forget you jenny
what more can a gentleman say
nothing
mackie you must flee
you ve been betrayed
is there still just one way out of this rattrap
stop him
he went out the window
you were in quite a hurry just now
i hadn t yet had the pleasure
is there someone waiting for you
she can wait
i live just over there
what is it now
never mind
come on
peachum
he got away
got away
his girls helped him escape
his girls
brown is the girl in question
tiger brown let his friend get away
well mr brown has out-browned himself
it s time we start thinking about the coronation parade
we only just met and you re already leaving
goes with the profession
busy busy busy
- come back soon
- of course
no long speeches
time is money
i m all yours gentlemen
you ve seen mackie s bold and reckless nature
i ll now show you how through a loving wife s cleverness things take a turn that even you wouldn t expect
the gentlemen of the board
gentlemen of the board one can rob a bank or one can
use a bank to rob others
tread the path of a respectable and law-abiding business as my papa so often told me
polly he always said
who d be so stupid as to be a burglar these days when we ve got laws
and though my husband -
i mean our most esteemed managing director - must hide like a fugitive in foreign parts i m certain he would approve of how we pulled this off
we bought this quiet elegant little bank which will be more profitable than finding a few puny safes - to rifle
now we ll really get down to business
gentlemen we will remain true to this institution s honorable tradition of building and consolidating the confidence of the pu-pu-public through our integrity and fiduciary trustworthiness
bravo
excellent
thank you gentlemen
i d just like to add that our firm can only employ top-quality people
street muggings and pickpocketing are for idiots
forget the romance of the past
life begins in earnest now
whoever can t rise to the challenge will be terminated forthwith without remuneration
good day gentlemen
you can learn a thing or two from her
this way mr brown
would you like to see him
- no for goďs sake
handle it yourself please
smith give him something to eat a decent meal
wine
cigarettes too
of course
wait
he only smokes cigars
give him these
he won t have time to smoke many more
hello mackie
hello smith
did brown have any news for me
he s very distraught and just when the coronation parade s coming up
i say smith you couldn t find any heavier handcuffs
with your kind permission i d like a more comfortable pair
well we have them in every price range from one guinea to ten
all depends on how much you wish to spend
how much for none at all
fifty
thanks captain
now what would you like to eat captain
what have you got in the canteen
no no prison fare for you
if you d like i ll get it from -
my last supper eh
there captain
now you can move about freely again
that s for someone else captain
so captain what would you like for dinner
leave it to me if you d like
the gentlemen here have always been most satisfied
do not turn a deaf ear to misfortune
hello
yes i ll send them right away
- group 3 is ready
- off you go
filch speaking
good
the 10th district is ready
they re to join the fourth at nelson s column at 8 00 a m
but we ve got real cripples
how can we make it by 8 00
you must
victim of military despotism
the ugliest are to march on the outside so the noble gentlemen will have a pretty sight to look at
the royal guard is presenting arms
dawn is breaking
they ll ride right over us
you ve got slingshots
- what if they shoot
- gentlemen
gentlemen at this very moment 1 432 of your colleagues are marching to pay their respects to the queen
you too wish to be part of this splendid occasion you poorest of the poor who d long ago have perished in the sewers of turnbridge if i hadn t spent sleepless nights devising a way to wring a few pence out of your poverty
for i ve shown that the rich of this world have no qualms about causing misery but can t bear the sight of it
they have hard hearts but weak nerves
well we won t spare their nerves today
by the thousands we ll tear at their nerves for our rags do not conceal our wounds
gentlemen do not be afraid
the queen will not allow cripples to be attacked with bayonets
forward
stop peachum
mackie s become a bank president
call your people back
our polly s a guest of honor in the stands
leave it to me
stop
back
stop where you are
back
stop
go back
back all of you
stop
go back
come to your senses
listen to reason
so make your little plan
yes be a shining light
then make yourself a second plan
none will turn out right
you see for this existence
there s no man who s bad enough
still it s nice to watch them
trying to be tough
i repeat we must have the remaining £ 3 000 in cash now
without fail
you understand
nervous gentlemen
well i m very calm
but tiger brown our best friend had him arrested
that must mean something
we must get £ 10 000 in bail to the police chief
i ll take it
there s turmoil in the streets
that s why i m giving it to our bank s trustworthy servant
it s 11 00
why aren t you at the stock exchange
stop
turn back
listen to me
stop
using force is pointless
they ll shoot you down
listen to me
you re marching to your own destruction
out of the question
no visitors allowed here
smith let me go in
jenny i can t be responsible if anyone should see you
smith darling i ll only be a second
i have to see that despicable scoundrel once more
mackie and i were close once

piccadilly
city bank
a real bank

an honest-to-goodness bank
take the first right then the third left
if you see cops keep to the left
no not right left

the coronation celebrations have begun
the police barrier s broken
the coronation parade s breaking up
crowds of beggars at westminster
pull the shades
hello
anyone here
mackie i m ruined
what a scandal
i ll be sacked
my days as police chief are over
don t worry
you ve come to the right place
you ll make a great bank director
how much capital would you like to invest
capital
£ 10 000
his bail
i salvaged it
hear that nitwits
there s a lesson there
come on
come along you old battleship full steam ahead for my whiskey bottle
polly gentlemen before you stands a man whom the king in his unfathomable wisdom elevated high above his fellow men
and yet this man remained my friend through every storm and so forth and so on
but fate moves in mysterious ways you all know what i mean
today this man comes to me mack the knife as one friend to another
there s a lesson there
do you remember when you and i were soldiers and served in the army in india
yes jackie
those were the days
john was there and jim was too
and georgie made sergeant in short order
the army doesn t give a fig who you are
and they marched us north to the border
soldiers live under the cannon s thunder
from the cape to cooch behar
if it should rain one night
and they should chance to sight
- an unfamiliar race - dark or fair of face
they might just chop them up to make their steak tartare
- johnny s whiskey was too warm - and jimmy thought he d freeze
- georgie took them by the arm - saying don t desert us please
soldiers live under the cannon s thunder
from the cape to cooch behar
if it should rain one night
and they should chance to sight
- an unfamiliar race - dark or fair of face
they just might chop them up to make their steak tartare
john is buried and jimmy s dead
and they shot poor georgie for looting
but blood is still blood-red
and the army s still recruiting
soldiers live under the cannon s thunder
from the cape to cooch behar
if it should rain one night
and they should chance to sight
an unfamiliar race dark or fair of face
they might just chop them up to make their steak tartare
the poorest man in london and the wealthy mack the knife - shouldn t they join forces
the poorest man in london is now bankrupt my dear peachum and is just another poor devil
today of all days showed me the power of the poor
with your money and my experience we can do business more business than you could ever imagine
if the poor are so powerful why do they need us
because they don t know that we need them
gathered for the happy ending
all and sundry pool their might
when the needed funds are handy
things will usually turn out right
though a man will fight his rival
to fish the muddy depths
in the end they ll dine together
and consume the poor man s bread
for some men live in darkness
while others stand in the light
we see those in the light
while the others fade from sight
how do you do
mr carl laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning -
we are about to unfold the story of frankenstein -
a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon god -
it is one of the strangest tales ever told -
it deals with the two great mysteries of creation
life and death -
i think it will thrill you -
it may shock you -
it might even horrify you -
so if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain now is your chance to er-- -
well we ve warned you -
amen - down - down you fool
now
come on
hurry hurry -
- we ve no time to lose - careful
here he comes
he s just resting - waiting for a new life to come -
here we are -
look it s still here -
climb up and cut the rope -
no
go on
- it can t hurt you -
here s a knife -
look out
here s the knife -
here i come -
is it all right
the neck s broken
- the brain is useless
we must find another brain -
that ll do gentlemen - and in conclusion ladies and gentlemen here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain ever to come to my attention at the university -
and here the abnormal brain of the typical criminal -
observe ladies and gentlemen the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe as compared to that of the normal brain and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe -
all of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the history of the dead man before us whose life was one of brutality of violence and murder -
these jars will remain here for your further inspection -
thank you gentlemen - the class is dismissed - herr victor moritz -
victor -
i m so glad you ve come - what is it elizabeth
oh you ve heard from henry - yes
- the first word in four months -
it just came -
victor you must help me - of course i ll help you -
i m afraid -
i ve read this over and over again but they re just words that i can t understand -
listen -
you must have faith in me elizabeth
- wait -
my work must come first even before you -
at night the winds howl in the mountains -
there is no one here -
prying eyes can t peer into my secret -
what can he mean
what does he say then
i am living in an abandoned watchtower close to the town of goldstadt -
only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments -
- his experiments - yes that s what frightens me -
the day we announced our engagement he told me of his experiments -
he said he was close to a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity -
there was a strange look in his eyes - some mystery -
his words carried me right away -
of course i ve never doubted him - but still i worry
- i can t help it -
and now this letter
- all this uncertainty can t go on
- i must know -
victor have you seen him
yes
- about three weeks ago -
i met him walking alone in the woods - he spoke to me of his work too -
i asked him if i might visit his laboratory -
he just glared at me and said he would let no one go there -
his manner was very strange - oh what can we do
if he should be ill
now don t worry -
i ll go to dr waldman henry s old professor in medical school -
perhaps he can tell me more about all this -
victor you re a dear -
you know i d go to the ends of the earth for you -
i shouldn t like that - i m far too fond of you -
i wish you were -
victor - i m sorry -
good night victor - and thank you
- thank you -
good night
- and don t worry
- promise
i won t -
victor
what is it
i m coming with you - you can t
i must
- i ll be ready in a minute -
herr frankenstein is a most brilliant young man yet so erratic -
he troubles me -
i m worried about henry - why has he left the university
he was doing so well and he seemed so happy with his work -
you know his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electrobiology were far in advance of our theories here at the university -
in fact they had reached a most advanced stage -
they were becoming dangerous -
herr frankenstein is greatly changed -
you mean changed as a result of his work
yes - his work -
his insane ambition to create life -
how how
please tell us everything whatever it is -
the bodies we use now dissecting them for lecture purposes were not perfect enough for his experiments he said -
he wished us to supply him with other bodies and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them -
i told him that his demands were unreasonable and so he left the university to work unhampered -
he found what he needed elsewhere - oh
- the bodies of animals -
well what are the lives of a few rabbits and dogs
you do not quite get what i mean -
herr frankenstein was interested only in human life -
first to destroy it then re-create it -
there you have his mad dream -
can we go to him
you will not be very welcome -
what does that matter
i must see him -
dr waldman you have influence with henry
- won t you come with us
i m sorry but herr frankenstein is no longer my pupil -
but he respects you - won t you help us to take him away
very well fraulein - i ve warned you -
but if you wish it i will go - fritz
have you finished those connections
yes they re done -
well come down then and help - we ve lots to do - look out
fool
if this storm develops as i hope you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night s over -
go on fix the electrodes - this storm will be magnificent -
all the electrical secrets of heaven -
and this time we re ready - hey fritz
ready -
why what s the matter
there s nothing to fear
- look -
no blood no decay -
just a few stitches -
and look
- here s the final touch -
the brain you stole fritz - yes -
think of it - the brain of a dead man waiting to live again in a body i made with my own hands -
with my own hands -
let s have one final test - throw the switches - good -
in 15 minutes the storm should be at its height -
then we ll be ready - what s that
there s someone there - shh
send them away
nobody must come here -
here
- cover this -
whoever it is don t let them in -
leave them to me -
of all the times for anybody to come
now i ll show them messing about at this time of night - got too much to do -
wait a minute
all right all right
wait a minute i m coming -
it s dr waldman fritz - you can t see him
- go away - all right knock
you won t get in - henry
frankenstein
henry frankenstein
henry
open the door
let us in
who is it
what do you want
you must leave me alone now -
it s elizabeth
open the door
henry
frankenstein
what do you want
open the door
you must leave me alone - at least give us shelter -
what s this nonsense of locked doors
henry
elizabeth please won t you go away
won t you trust me just for tonight
you re ill
- what s the matter
nothing
- i m quite all right
- truly i am -
can t you see i mustn t be disturbed
you ll ruin everything - my experiment is almost completed -
wait a moment
- i understand -
i believe in you - but i cannot leave you tonight -
you ve got to leave
henry you re inhuman
- you re crazy
crazy am i
we ll see whether i m crazy or not -
come on up -
you re quite sure you want to come in
very well -
forgive me but i m forced to take unusual precautions -
sit down please -
sit down
you too elizabeth
- please -
a moment ago you said i was crazy -
tomorrow we ll see about that - don t touch that i m sorry doctor but i insist -
please -
doctor waldman i learnt a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray the ultraviolet ray which you said was the highest colour in the spectrum -
you were wrong -
here in this machinery i have gone beyond that -
i have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world -
- and your proof
tonight you shall have your proof -
at first i experimented only with dead animals and then a human heart which i kept beating for three weeks -
but now i m going to turn that ray on that body and endow it with life -
and you really believe that you can bring life to the dead
that body is not dead -
it has never lived -
i created it
- i made it with my own hands from the bodies i took from graves from the gallows anywhere -
go and see for yourself - you too -
dead hey
quite a good scene isn t it
one man crazy three very sane spectators - yes
test the batteries -
look
- it s moving -
it s alive
- it s alive
it s alive
- it s moving
- it s alive
it s alive
it s alive now i know what it-- - henry is well but he s very busy - it s alive
it s alive
henry in the name of god
in the name of god
he said he would get in touch with you soon -
don t worry about him baron - he ll be home in a few days -
you two have it all arranged haven t you
you think i m an idiot don t you
but i m not -
anyone can see with half an eye that there s something wrong -
and i ve two eyes and pretty good ones at that -
well what is it
you re quite mistaken baron -
what s the matter with my son
what s he doing
he s completing his experiments -
why does he go messing around an old ruined windmill when he has a decent house a bath good food and drink and a darned pretty girl to come back to
would you tell me that
baron you don t understand - i understand perfectly well -
there s another woman and you re afraid to tell me -
pretty sordid experiments these must be - huh
oh but you re wrong
and how do you know
if you please herr baron the burgomaster -
well tell him to go away - but he says it s important -
nothing the burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance -
good day herr baron
- fraulein -
well what do you want
if it s trouble go away - i ve trouble enough -
oh there s no trouble sir - what do you mean no trouble
there s nothing but trouble -
i brought you these flowers - thank you herr vogel -
both in my private and official capacities as burgomaster-- -
yes yes yes we know all about that but what do you want
what i really want to know is when will the wedding be if you please -
unless henry comes to his senses there ll be no wedding at all -
but the village is already prepared - well tell them to unprepare -
but such a lovely bride-- -
such a fine young man the very image of his father -
heaven forbid - but sir everything is ready
i know that
don t keep on saying so you idiot
there s nothing to cry about -
good day miss elizabeth - good day herr moritz -
good day herr vogel -
good day herr baron -
and good riddance to you -
there you are
- huh you see how it is -
the whole village is kept waiting the bride is kept waiting and i am kept waiting
- henry must come home if i have to fetch him myself -
no no baron
- what about his work
stuff and nonsense - what about his wedding
there is another woman-- - and i m going to find her - come and sit down doctor -
you must be patient -
do you expect perfection at once
this creature of yours should be kept under guard -
mark my words he will prove dangerous -
dangerous
poor old waldman -
have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous
where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond
have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars
or to know what causes the trees to bud
and what changes the darkness into light
but if you talk like that-- - people call you crazy -
well if i could discover just one of these things - what eternity is for example - i wouldn t care if they did think i was crazy -
you re young my friend - your success has intoxicated you -
wake up and look facts in the face
here we have a fiend whose brain-- -
whose brain must be given time to develop -
it s a perfectly good brain doctor -
well you ought to know - it came from your own laboratory -
the brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain -
oh well - after all it s only a piece of dead tissue -
only evil can come of it -
your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness -
i m astonishingly sane doctor -
you have created a monster and it will destroy you -
patience patience -
i believe in this monster as you call it -
and if you don t well you must leave me alone -
but think of elizabeth
- your father -
elizabeth believes in me -
my father
he never believes in anyone -
i ve got to experiment further -
he s only a few days old remember -
so far he s been kept in complete darkness -
wait till i bring him into the light - here he comes
come in -

yes indeed sir
just you wait a little while the nasty man in black will come

10 000 marks reward who is the murderer
since june 11 little klaus klawltzky and his sister klara have disappeared
what a pretty ball
what s your name
elsie beckmann

thank you
a thrilling new chapter passionate moving sensational
just a moment mr gehrke
- yes have you seen elsie
didn t she just come up the stairs
no she isn t here yet
she won t be long now good-bye mrs beckmann
good-bye mr gehrke
extra extra
because the police have not published my first letter i am writing today directly to the newspapers continue your investigations
everything will happen just as i have told you but i have not yet finished
10 000 marks reward who is the murderer christ here we go again
it s horrible 10 000 marks the lettering is too small
we can t read it hey you read it out loud - the unknown murderer
quiet the terror in our town has found a new certain evidence leads us to believe that the murderer is the same one who has already killed eight children
we must remind you again that a mother s first duty is to guard her children from the danger which always threatens
also the danger is often hidden in some attractive bait
candy a toy and fruit can be the murderer s weapons
come on come on read read on
okay okay the anxiety of the general public is very high because the police have not yet completed their investigations
the criminal has left no clue who is the murderer
what is he like
where is he hiding
no one knows
still he is one of us
is it your neighbor
yes that s right
why look at me when you say that
- you know very well
- what do i know very well
- think about it
- what are you saying
i saw you go up those stairs behind that little girl
what
you are crazy you dirty swine
who s a swine me or a man who chases little girls
you bastard you swine
murderer gentlemen
gentlemen i ll see you in court i ll see you in court
slanderer terrible man the police listen to him
they re searching my house
how awful
what a shame searching a man s house because of an anonymous letter
mr jager calm down
we re only doing our job when we are so upset scared about the children
look that s why the police must follow every clue
any man in the street could be the guilty one
can you please tell me what time it is yes my child
now my child go home
where do you live
what s it to you where the kid lives
why were you bothering that kid
but - but - i did nothing
what do you want with me
just you wait and see
let me go
it s an outrage - what s going on
- it s an outrage
don t get so excited punch him in the face
- bothering children
- acting like a big shot let me go
i did nothing you wanted to get her alone didn t you
yes then kill her like all the others right
it s the murderer
it s him hold him call the police
no police around when you need them officer officer
move along please move along now
don t block
you can catch pickpockets but you d better get the murderer
what
is he the murderer
move along now
come on get a move on
murderer writes to newspapers
it s a terrible scandal
this will have a bad effect on public opinion lnspector
it s very serious
but sir we cannot stop the murderer from writing letters
this man is a mental case he gets a kick from seeing himself in the papers
we immediately got in touch with the newspaper
they sent us the original letter the lab is working on it
of course you can t get good fingerprints from a postcard which went through so many hands
we ll compare the results with our archives
we must try everything to find a clue or a lead then we ll send the letter to the graphologist
the very particular shape of the letters do you follow me
some of the broken letters reveal an actor s personality which can be indolent or even lazy
yes lnspector certainly you and your men are very good
but nevertheless results we must have results
minister my men are only getting 12 hours sleep a week as well as searches on the spot minister
they start their shift already tired don t forget this job is nervously trying especially when the success rate is so low
the homicide officers work restlessly
they re always on alert following any clue even the slightest one that may lead us to our man
minister consider their findings on the scene of the crime
we find for instance behind a hedge a little white paper bag
clearly it held the candy
in a corner we found some crumbs and some sugar grains
within a radius of 2 kilometers we have searched in all the candy shops to find out where the bag came from
but in vain
every day the search widens
but of course no one remembers anything
nevertheless we keep on searching getting nowhere without much hope of finding a solution
our men
what good is that
i know you re trying but an unknown murderer terrorizes the town
a town of four million and your police are failing
minister you don t seem to understand the difficulties
only on the way home of the missing child we got fifteen different testimonies
just listen testimony 1478 in the beckmann murder case
- more than you sir
gentlemen can t you agree what color hat that little girl wore when you saw her
of course lnspector it was red
- lnspector it was green
- lt was a red hat
it was a green hat
stop it s hopeless
thank you gentlemen
- of course lnspector if you listen to a color-blind man
the police have investigated over 1 500 clues
documents fill 60 volumes
we have all available men
we have systematically combed all adjoining areas
every thicket every piece of undergrowth every bush in every hole we might find something
we sent out police dogs the best trackers are on the scent to no avail
since the murderer s first crime police have inspected all the flop-houses every night and checked the identity of every vagrant
such measures hurt our popularity and make people nervous
but we watch all railway stations and raid the underworld hangouts
despite all this the police haven t succeeded in finding anything
the police get back
please let me go won t you you son of a bitch
let go
let her go you filthy pig
the head cop quiet
you d like that wouldn t you
police orders nobody leaves get your papers ready
c mon kids let s not be stupid
it s fatty lohmann loh-mann loh-mann loh-mann
loh-mann loh-mann
quiet quiet
you ll wear yourselves out it would be better if you got the murderer yes
quiet

spread out
all of you spread out
- show me your papers please let me go lnspector

you can t have ten minutes peace anymore give us a break
it s no joke for us either out every night
of course but you re drivin away my clientele and the guy you re looking for ain t here
do you know how mad everyone is about this guy who s causing a raid every night
specially the girls
sure they solicit but believe me everyone is a little mother at heart
i know a lot of crooks get sort of tender when they see kids
if they catch that bastard they ll wring his neck
ready to go sarge good night
so it s the crocodile tonight
two loads for the nick
what s keeping schranker
is it three o clock yet
i ll find out
hello the exact time please
two minutes to three thank you
there are more police on the street tonight than whores
wherever you spit cops
even when you ve got a broad they don t leave you alone
they ve gone nuts all they think about is the murderer
i have a little six-year-old and every night i have to look under the bed and in the closet to see if the murderer is hiding there
you can t even do your job the police are everywhere
there s no privacy anymore i m fed up with it tell us something new
what s keeping schranker
maybe he s been caught
not him
he did a bank job in london
scotland yard trapped him
there he was hands up back to the wall millions of cops around two seconds later there were two corpses and he d beat it
the best man between berlin and san francisco
six years they ve looked and they haven t caught him yet
god be praised at last well hello
good afternoon are you crazy
close the curtains
gentlemen the meeting can now begin
according to regulations i confirm that the leadership of every organization in our union is represented i assume you are all authorized to vote on behalf of your members good
let s not be held up by procedure
we all know why we are here
some non-member is screwing up our affairs
daily raids by the police for the child murderer interfere with our business
we can t put up with this pressure any longer in every hotel cafe or pad
this state of affairs must not be allowed to continue
we have to put things right again or we ll all be ruined
our funds are exhausted
we ll have to use money allocated for our colleagues wives who are being hosted by the state
furthermore our reputation is suffering
when i run into a cop while on business he knows the risk and so do i if one of us dies ok that s a risk one takes
it can happen but you and i are not on the level of this murderer
absolutely
we are doing our job we have to make a living
but this monster has no right to live
he must disappear
he must be eliminated without pity without scruples
gentlemen our members have to carry on normal business without being handicapped by nervous policemen
i ask you for advice
i suggest a closer watch on ld cards systematic searches and police raids
more raids and much tougher ones
spies
we need spies among the police to give us warnings
the girls must take a little more notice of the cops we get into trouble because one of the girls has talked too much to her cop boyfriend
we must be allowed to search any house apartment back yard in order to find a clue
we have contacts we have to make a statement to the press we have to tell them that we condemn the bastard too
we should make it known that he isn t in the underworld
i m sure it s a man who looks like he wouldn t hurt a fly
in his normal state he might even play marbles with the kids or cards with his wife
otherwise murderers like grossmann or haarmann couldn t live for years like they did without their neighbors suspecting them at all
we have to get that across to the public they must help
don t talk to me about the public helping
it disgusts me just to hear them talk
excuse me chief
but it s the truth christ
help from the public brings no clues
just a pile of letters with the most incredible accusations
quite true calls to the police the moment a garbage man crosses a yard
but when we need accurate information they can t remember
they ve seen nothing
you re exaggerating a little lohmann
most of the people don t feel concerned
the majority of them doesn t realize that a child disappearance is also their problem
let s get one of those guys a telepath one who finds handkerchiefs and pocketbooks that have been hidden
i don t think the reward is enough chief we have to offer a real fortune for the murderer
none of this is getting us anywhere - that won t do any good
- what s your idea well we just can t wait until the police decide to arrest the fellow
the difficulty in solving crimes like this comes from the fact that the criminal and the victim are connected only by chance
an instantaneous impulse is the killer s only motive
we find the victim we identify him then we find out when he was last seen
then nothing more
children disappear and you know what state we find them in
if we find them
and the killer as we know in this kind of crime never leaves a mark behind
the police have been looking for eight months
now they ll catch him only by luck
- we can t wait for that
- we ll be ruined before then
then what will we do
we ll have to catch him ourselves
there is still one possible way
the guilty man must have a record somewhere a man that disturbed must have come upon the law before
we ve got to contact every clinic every prison every asylum
we ll have to make inquiries about everyone freed as harmless but with the same pathological condition as the killer
every square foot must be permanently watched
from now on no child takes a step without us being warned
ok but how do we do it
there must be people who can go everywhere not be noticed who can follow children without arousing suspicion who can follow children right up to their front doors
people no one would suspect
but who
people like that don t exist
who could do it who
the beggars
the beggars union can do it
- sausage going up
- god this cheese smells good
stop snoring you ll wake up the lice
now we must take the back yards
yes from number 1 to 88
next
you are responsible for the courtyards in every block 1 to 88
right
- what s next
what s your union number
3 7 95 emil dustermann 3 7 95 dustermann emil
thank you ladies and gentlemen
thank you
when searching homes we must look for any clue which could establish where the murderer s letter to the papers originated
if there is an old wooden table if there is a red pencil or writing paper of the same type inquiries must be discreet
idiot
and here s a list of mental patients who have been let out as cured or harmless in the last five years
and that s a list of their present addresses

funny friends leaving you right in it and running off bah
that won t wash with me lnspector
after all i m not risking very much maybe a little bit of damage but nothing was stolen
of course something was stolen
in fact a good deal
what
stolen how much
if you talk i ll tell you
i ve already told you i don t know anything
well think about it
it s amazing what one remembers when one is left alone for an hour or two
take him away
send the night watchman in here
sit down
now then you said in your statement
- listen carefully you may have to repeat it under oath
you clearly heard one of the burglars say to another we ve found him
i ve discovered the guy
he s in the attic is that correct

i wanted to ask you a favor
disgusting
i wanted to ask you
anyway read a bit of that
- reports
- yes burglary in an office block
bennostrasse
that s a very quiet neighborhood
perhaps it s not as quiet as all that
hell this is becoming serious
did they intend to empty the whole place then
what can they have been looking for in the coal
look at that
it s incredible
good lord
this is madness
ah now it makes sense
they were after the safe good god
what s it all about
they haven t even attacked that one
well i ll be damned well what have you got to say
nothing stolen but a man taken
fantastic
and franz the burglar was arrested
isn t talking
frightened evidently actually i know him well
he s one who d rather jump from the fifth floor than get mixed up in a murder
could we set a trap for him
could you help me lohmann
i see what you re getting at
let s take a look at this franz
you re wanted for questioning what
four people for me
the murder squad
what do you want with me
what s the murder squad want
yes old boy your case has been passed over to me now
but why
what for
you did your work a little too well
one of the watchmen
dead
planning and assisting with a murder
it s a bad show franz i can t go on with it i don t want to have anything to do with it
i ll tell you everything everything i know
very wise but unfortunately too late
inspector it can t be too late
please lnspector it isn t possible
listen i m going to tell you everything
even who we were looking for in that damn building
the child murderer
what who
the child murderer lnspector
wait
this had to happen to me
sit down
now we re going to have a little talk
if you want to lnspector and mind you don t lie
ok let s start what have you do to with the murderer and where d you take him
well lnspector you know the old distillery of kuntz and levy
- the one that went bankrupt
what do you want with me
what do you bastards want with me
what do you want
help help
let me go i want to get out get me out of here
let me out
you will not get out of here
but gentlemen i don t even know what you want me for
i beg you set me free
there must be some mistake
no no
no mistake
no mistake
do you recognize it
it s a balloon like the one you gave little elsie beckmann
a balloon like that
where did you bury little martha
but i never i never even knew her
you never knew her
and what about this one and this one
stop him stop him don t let him get away
let me go
you talk of rights
you will get your rights
we are all law experts here
from 6 weeks in tegel prison to 15 years in brandenburg
you will get your rights you will even get a lawyer
everything will be done according to the rule of law
a lawyer a lawyer
i don t need a lawyer
who is accusing me
you maybe you
just a moment if i were you sir i d keep quiet
your life s at stake in case you didn t know it
who are you
i have the dubious honor of being your defense counsel
but i m afraid it won t be much use to you
but but
do you want to kill me
murder me just like that we just want to render you harmless
but you ll only be that way when you are dead
but if you kill me it ll be cold-blooded murder
i demand that you hand me over to the police
i demand to be handed over to the jurisdiction of common law
that would suit you wouldn t it then you ll invoke paragraph 51 and spend the rest of your life in an institution at state expense
and then you d escape or else get a pardon then there you are free as air with a law-protected pass because of mental illness off again chasing little girls
we re not going to let that happen
we must make you powerless
you must disappear yes disappear
i can t help what i do
i can t help it i can t
the old story we never can help it in court
what do you know about it
who are you anyway
who are you
criminals
are you proud of yourselves proud of breaking safes or cheating at cards
things you could just as well keep your fingers off
you wouldn t need to do all that if you d learn a proper trade or if you d work
if you weren t a bunch of lazy bastards but i i can t help myself
i have no control over this this evil thing inside me the fire the voices the torment
you mean to say that you have to murder
it s there all the time driving me out to wander the streets following me silently but i can feel it there
it s me pursuing myself
i want to escape to escape from myself
but it s impossible i can t escape
i have to obey it i have to run endless streets
i want to escape to get away
and i m pursued by ghosts ghosts of mothers and of those children
they are there always there
always except when i do it
then i can t remember anything and afterwards i see those posters and read what i ve done
did i do that
but i can t remember anything about it
but who will believe me
who knows what it s like to be me
how i m forced to act how i must
must don t want to
don t want to but must and then a voice screams i can t bear to hear it
the accused has said that he cannot help himself
that is to say he has to murder
as this is the case he has pronounced his own death sentence someone who admits to being a compulsive murderer should be snuffed out like a candle
this man must be wiped out eliminated
i wish to speak
the defense lawyer will speak
our very honorable president who is i believe wanted by the police for three murders -
that s got nothing to do with it claims that because my client acts under an irresistible impulse he is condemned to death
he is right he is mistaken
because it is that very fact that clears him
just a minute enough
mad old drunk
is this very obsession which makes my client not responsible
and nobody can be punished for something he can t help - ridiculous
- do you suggest that this brute should get off
i mean this man is sick
a sick man should be handed over not to the executioner but to the doctor
can you promise he d be cured
what use are asylums then
and what would happen if he escaped
yes
or if they released him as harmless and what if the compulsion to kill returns
another man-hunt for months paragraph 51 again the asylum then another escape or release
then the compulsion all over again and so on and on
no one can kill a man who isn t responsible for his actions not the state and certainly not you
the state must see that this man becomes harmless and no longer is a danger to his fellow citizens
you ve never had children huh
so you haven t lost any but if you knew what it s like to lose one
go ask the parents ask them what those days and nights were like when they didn t know what had happened and then when they finally knew
do you think they ll have mercy
- she s right - i ll say she is
- no mercy no pardon
- give the murderer to us
kill the beast - crush the brute - kill him
all that won t silence me
i won t allow a crime to be committed in my presence
i demand that this man that this man be granted the protection of the law
i demand that this man be handed over to the police
- to the police - filthy stooge
in the name of the law
in the name of the people
this won t bring back our children
we too should keep a closer watch on our children
- what is it
- sorry to have to report there are four stowaways in the forward hatch
stowaways
how do you know there are four of them
they were singing sweet adeline
get them out of there you hear

haven t we been announced
i am fräulein von kesten
please don t get up your excellency
i ll take a seat too please
i am afraid to say that the headmistress is indisposed at present
i m so sorry
she regrets very much not being able to welcome you herself
please tell the headmistress that i also regret it very much
i wanted to introduce our little niece myself
manuela make a curtsey
how do you do
– well you re pretty big for fourteen – fourteen and a half
how is her education progressing
her education so far could have been better
she s almost an orphan
my brother-in-law is certainly a good man but you know what army officers are like
they don t understand about educating young girls
unfortunately my poor sister died too soon
she s overly sensitive and a bit of a scatterbrain
there s no harm in a few tears you ll get over it
manuela pull yourself together
an officer s daughter crying
hey
you can t go up there
– why not
– come down
it s forbidden
hello
i am margo von rasso
i m to look after you
so manuela chin up now make your father proud of you
work hard and do as you re told i want you to get good results
don t spoil my plans for your future
– do you promise
– of course aunt
give me a kiss then
adieu fräulein von kesten
– goodbye your excellency
thank you for everything you will do for the child
do well manuela
come on this way
the main stairs are only for the headmistress and guests
first we ll get your uniform
the wardrobe mistress is expecting you
it s on the fourth floor
i ll show you the ropes
but you must do things for me too
– yes marga
in the morning you ll bring me water for washing
that s just the under class
and everyone shouts as loud as they can
when do we eat
and everyone shouts as loud as they can
when do we eat
i m hungry as a hunter
that s the new girl
– i m oda von oldensleben
– i m barbara von beckendorf
i m ilse von treischke
do you know what dormitory you re in
marga says i m in fräulein von bernburg s
so am i be careful you don t fall in love
why
because all the girls have a crush on fräulein von bernburg
god i can t bear to listen to it
ilse how i envy you
you re in her dormitory
oh god oh god
tell me is it true that she kisses you at night
i ve had lots of weird governesses i didn t pay attention to them
– it s funny with her
you never know how to take her
one minute she looks at you terribly then all of a sudden she s very kind
she s really strange that bernburg
ilse you shouldn t call her just bernburg
ah be glad i don t call her the golden one
manuela where have you been
come with me
nice girl isn t she
ah there you are come in here
come here
so you re no 124
come on get undressed
– what are you doing with my dress
– keep quiet little one
in five weeks if you behave you ll have a day out then you ll get your clothes back
now come over here
come here sit on this chair
now for your hair
oh please don t do that
it is the rules
the hair must be plaited tightly
– it hurts
– you will get used to it
– oh those hairpins
– it s the rules too soon you won t notice it
come with me we ll put on your dress
it is too long
we have to pin it up
– someone s worn this before
– of course what do you think
a new dress for each girl wouldn t be economical says fräulein von kesten
no no we are not that generous
when a girl leaves her dress is handed on until it s worn out
look what does this mean
a heart and the letters e v b
this means elisabeth von bernburg
the girl who wore that dress before must have been infatuated with fräulein von bernburg
so you are the new girl
show me how you look
all right
now turn around
your hair needs to be tidier
why are you shivering
are you nervous
no
that s good
manuela i demand total discipline
you must notify me before leaving the dormitory
talking while dressing and undressing is strictly forbidden
is that clear
good you may go to the others
this is your cupboard
the key s there open it
books
they are forbidden
you must give them to me
why
– have you any money
– some
give it to me
– why s that
– it s not allowed
they keep it for you
come over here
grand eh
mia stuck up a picture of henny porten
but i ve got hans albers
and he s got a lot of
what s it called
what do they call what all the movie stars have
sex appeal
yes he s got that
– chocolate
have to give it up
– but i – no buts
rules are rules
– heavens marga don t be like that
it s nothing to do with you
i m in charge of the new girl
my name s edelgard
can i help you
yes please
what s that book
– i was going to read it on the journey
it s from my uncle s library i haven t read it yet
wow
this is great
– you must give it to me
– no i must not
it s my book
– what s all this
marga
– yes fräulein von kesten
– something forbidden
– yes fräulein von kesten
take these things away
meinhardis come here
i keep my good and bad marks in here
if anything forbidden is found in your cupboard you get a black mark
if you get more than five black marks in four weeks you re not allowed out
so watch out
dismissed
here are the bills headmistress
headmistress please
you must reduce expenses
they are too high
yes headmistress
we do our best
the children are already complaining of hunger
hunger
we prussians know how to hunger
they are children of soldiers
and god willing mothers of soldiers too
what they need is discipline not a life of luxury
– how true headmistress how true
– poverty is no sin
it enobles
this is the true meaning of prussianism as it once was
let the others gorge themselves
they ll be sorry
what i like best is stuffed roast hare
our cook makes a big coffee cake with a crumble topping this thick
eclairs with whipped cream are even better
through discipline and hunger hunger and discipline we shall be great again or not at all
my mother wrote that they ve been slaughtering on the farm
oh why can t she send me a ham
nobody must have more than anyone else
but if she just sent a whole ham
some girls parents aren t well off any more
i d give them some
i wouldn t eat it all myself
why scrape so much butter off
don t blame me there s only half a pound for fifty girls
the girls are as meek as lambs they daren t complain about anything
everything is discipline and order here
line up
hurry up
the little meinhardis headmistress
well well
get ready for the prayers
march forward
closer
forward
closer
we ll sing the first verse of the hymn so take my hand
i ask you to raise your hearts and hands to repent your sins acknowledge the errors of your ways and beg forgiveness of your father in heaven – amen
i have something further to say
it has reached my ears that certain rules are being disobeyed
letters are being sent without prior approval with unfounded complaints about the school
staff will report any further incidents to me
the first culprit will be severely punished
days out will be cancelled and wearing uniform forbidden
own clothes will have to be worn when walking through town
just imagine her naked
you have been warned
i wouldn t send my children to a boarding school
would you
– i d have to think about it
that s the infantry that s the cavalry
girls come here a minute
look what marie can do
come here marie
watch
come on marie – leave me alone
you re always laughing at me
no no just take a deep breath
what a body
quiet
what s all this noise
edelgard
what are you doing
we were talking of manuela s mother
she died a long time ago manuela told me about her
go and wash
you have no mother
no
otherwise i wouldn t be here
come now is that so terrible
come here
don t tell yourself it s awful here
it s still strange to you
you don t know the other girls yet
but you mustn t think you ll always be unhappy
listen to me
you must tell yourself that you ll be very happy here
pray to god every night and ask him to help you
will you promise me
see what a reasonable girl you are
now go to bed
i ll come back to say goodnight
watch
it has reached my ears that certain rules are being disobeyed
you have been warned
quiet
everybody to bed
– well are you all ready
– yes fräulein von bernburg
gives each one a smacker
wonderful
watch manuela
it s my turn next
step step step
hey josi bleicher has a crush on me
listen
dearest sweetest mia
let me be with you and sit near you at table
from your loving little josi
what s that note
show me
hurry up
i m waiting
i m not interested in your silly games
throw it in the basket and remember once and for all
writing notes is strictly forbidden
– thank you
that was awfully nice of fräulein von bernburg
she is always so decent
i try to be a friend to the children
– on equal terms
– why not
how do you maintain authority
you are their superior and must keep your distance
we must awaken the children s ambition
excellent fräulein von attems
affinity has no place here
that might lead to emotionalism
always love
discipline is the main thing
the german classics must be cultivated
fräulein von bernburg i have noticed that you give very few black marks
i ve no need to punish the children they obey me and learn well
indeed and manuela von meinhardis
yes she doesn t do well
but that will change
i find her charming
and she does her work superbly
oh manuela is so ladylike
she learns excellently with me
she prepares my lessons better than the other girls
so far although i say it myself the results of my teaching have always been good
yes exceptionally good
ladies please
yes we know that
and we appreciate it
but please do not try to exceed your duties
certainly not
but the children must trust us
sit down
so jacob was in a strange land with his father-in-law laban and wanted to return to canaan with his wives rachel and lea and his children
who wants to tell the story
jacob lifted up his eyes and behold esau came
he was his brother
of his many wives the most beautiful one was rachel and with little joseph and benjamin he put her behind him – why behind him
because he was afraid he d given esau some red pottage and feared he might still be angry
and the sheep he put in front
esau approached and warmly embraced him
then jacob rejoiced
that s very nice
be seated
how is our work for today
edelgard first verse
oh that i had a thousand tongues and a thousand mouths then would i use them all to sing from the depths of my heart praises for all eternity
well done sit down
manuela second verse
oh that my voice would carry to
unprepared again
edelgard this is too terrible
i really learned it well but in front of fräulein von bernburg i forget everyting
fräulein von bernburg wants to see you
i wonder why
i feel sorry for fräulein manuela
sorry for her
why may i ask
she cries a lot at night
her pillow is always wet through
of course not
she must be homesick
i won t be able to say a thing
i feel faint
ah never mind
come in
come here
look at this
tell me haven t you any new clothes
where were you before you came here
– at my aunt s
at your aunt s
full of holes
my aunt thought it would do
and what do you think
that it won t do
i agree it won t do
perhaps we can find a new petticoat somewhere
it may be a bit long but we can take it up
for me
too good for me
– silly child
what an emotional girl you are
come
have a good cry
sit down
i m not unhappy at all
i don t know why i m crying
tell me are you homesick
homesick
no
i just feel like crying sometimes
and you don t know why
or is it something you can t trust me with
i can trust you with everything but it s hard to say
well try
i d really like to know
when you say goodnight and leave and shut the door to your room i stare at the door in the darkness
i want to get up and come to you but i know that i can t
and i think of when i get older and have to leave the school and every night you will kiss other girls
– what thoughts you have
– i love you so much
but you re always so distant
i can t ever go to your room and talk to you or hold your hands
– well child control yourself
don t be a little girl be a good comrade
you know i can t make exceptions
or the other girls will be jealous
i think of you often manuela
oh i am so glad
– now you won t cry anymore
– no no more
well there you are what is it now
may i ask you something
are you happy
you can t imagine how wonderful it is to live for you children
now just run downstairs to the others and take your washing with you
thank you so much
girls another boring sunday
my mother says i mustn t be weak
the fatherland needs people of steel
my mother spent four years here too
has she forgotten how awful it is
how deep it is
once again
come here marga
– what are you doing
how deep is this hole
silly you can test it by the law of gravity
– how do you do it
– you count the seconds it takes to reach the bottom then add the acceleration of gravity – 9 81
great
i ll try with a firework – no don t
you ll only make a noise
watch girls
one two
girls listen to this
dear parents today is another horrid sunday
why are we even hungrier on sundays than on other days
please send me something to eat
your loving daughter ilse

thank you very much johanna
goodbye
to celebrate the birthday of our distinguished headmistress
hold o queen
long was i sunk in a delusive dream
i loved but now i am at last awake
oh manuela you look so handsome
do you think she will like me
she must like me
– of course
just watch
today i certainly won t forget my lines
hold o queen
long was i sunk in a delusive dream
i loved but now i am at last awake
all alone madam madman
with none of your ladies-in-waiting
to what rude boldness my indulgence leads
our pleasant sojourn in aranjuez is over now
and yet your highness quits / these joyous scenes no happier than before
elise where is my beard
quiet now comes our scene
cannot some letters be discovered
truly an intercepted letter from the prince would work with rare effect
this letter came back because it was wrongly addressed
sender
ilse von westhagen
by heaven
i m all amazement
compass this
and i ll bow down to thee dominican
soft
some one comes
tis she – tis she herself
open it
give it to me
why are we even hungrier on sundays than on other days
charming words
now listen to me
children who lie and smuggle letters cannot be in plays
take your costume off
i can t be in the play
– no
fortunately the letter was wrongly addressed
your parents have been spared the anguish of an ungrateful child
leave me alone
stop dreaming
and for the future carlos stands nearer the throne
no child
how often do i have to tell you
don t just speak declaim
and for the future carlos stands nearer the throne
oh go
you have no talent child
next please posa
repeat the sentence you always stumble on
i know it very well
good grief child one pen-stroke now one motion of your hand
one pen-stroke now one motion of your hand
on your knees arms open
– i thought
– don t think obey
grant us liberty of thought fräulein von attems
of course little eboli come
repeat your sentences
o carlos how cruelly you play with me
no no
here you must bring into play the whole art of feminine seduction
just listen to me
she looks at him and says
o carlos how cruelly you play with me
excuse me fräulein von attems but it s about to start
– good evening children
– good evening headmistress
be seated
i will not leave you here hans
because of internal difficulties the role of domingo will be read by liese von zieritz
our pleasant sojourn in aranjuez is over now
and yet your highness quits / these joyous scenes no happier than before
come here
you ve got yourself in a fine mess
come it s not that bad
i m not in the play either
wash your face and come downstairs
she s so adorable
at length tis come – the happy moment s come
carlos may touch this all-beloved hand
i hear a step
what boldness
arise
i will not rise here will i kneel forever
here will i lie enchanted at your feet and grow to the dear ground you tread on
madman
to what rude boldness my indulgence leads
know you it is the queen your mother whom you address in such presumptuous strain
and know that i must die
let them come here and drag me to the scaffold
a moment spent in paradise like this is not too clearly purchased by a life
but then your queen
god god
i ll go
i will leave you
hurry with the lemon
have a taste
what a fine punch you ve brewed
– it s a real punch
– it ll make them tipsy
know what the head said
she has pretty legs pretty legs
– what did fräulein von bernburg say
– it was strange
bernburg didn t say a single word
but she watched you
you can t imagine how closely she watched you
now be quiet a moment children
i was quite satisfied with you
manuela you were very good
just remember for the next time better declaiming and less emotion
manuela i want to tell you
you are very talented
if you work hard you could be a very good actress
i m very glad of that manuela
the children really performed well
it s very good exercise for the girls to learn to recite schiller
nothing is better than the german classics
we re grateful to you headmistress
the children are so lucky to be here in your charge headmistress
we do our best with the little we have
silence
your majesties your highnesses your excellencies and so on
i am happy that you managed without my assistance to win the applause of the staff and their guests
i wish to congratulate you
your helmets swords and boots were polished to perfection
and everything else went well too
but it could have been tighter tighter tighter
still you played your parts well
especially our don carlos
to your health manuela
it tastes vile
you rhine maiden that punch you brewed is really something
look i like this stuff
here take mine
i m quite tipsy
play something else
all right
i ll play patern
shall i tell the girls to be quiet
let them enjoy themselves today
yes it s good for them to let their hair down
fräulein von kesten keep an eye on them
i was somewhat surprised schiller sometimes writes very freely
– i m so happy
– your hurt me
what is it
e v b
girls
i want to make a speech
i love you all
want to know something
she gave me a present
– what
a petticoat
i ve got it on – a petticoat
she opened her cupboard and gave me a petticoat
i should wear it and think of her
no she didn t actually say that but that s what she must have meant
i m so happy
now i know for sure – she loves me
– who fräulein von bernburg
nothing else matters
she is there
she loves me
i m not afraid of anything
yes everyone should know about it
long live fräulein von bernburg beloved by all
has she gone mad
long may she live
scandalous
it was awful to see poor manuela so drunk
you have to drink sometimes
from sorrow or worry i understand it very well
if it was up to me i d expel her immediately
such a child doesn t deserve to be here
– you are quite right
i agree
her place is in – a reform school
– quite
edelgard have you seen manuela
– no i m not allowed in no one is
– i don t understand anything at all
i would advise you to be more careful
please no good advise
i m tired of being careful
ma ch re you re not going to jeopardise your prospects because of this child
– perhaps i am
– my god but why
– because i can t stand injustice
look out
hanni i feel peculiar
i can t think straight
and my head really hurts
hanni how did i get here
you were well and truly drunk
it was quite a spectacle
aren t you ashamed of yourself
the disgrace
this establishment has never seen such a scandal
you are the worst child the school has ever had
if you were younger you d be spanked
look at me
look at me i said
it s hardly creditable
you behaved like a street urchin
you have brought shame to the school
where is the headmistress
your punishment will be decided later
you are well aware of what you did to fräulein von bernburg
she ll never forgive you
what did i do
there was a phone call for you
her highness is visiting us this afternoon
manuela must be there
we must be at full strength
but she may not speak to the others
hurry with the arrangements
her highness is always punctual
yes headmistress
always punctual
girls
have you heard
the head says manuela should be cursed
– my god poor manuela
– she shouldn t have behaved like that
– marga you re always mean to her
– shut up
did you hear the head ranting and raving
have you heard about manuela
– it s mean
quiet
what s the matter
why are you staring at me like that
i have something to say before the princess arrives
a sorry and unprecedented case of insubordination has occurred
the headmistress wished to save you from contact with the culprit but because of the visit an exception is being made
manuela von meinhardis is coming out of the sickroom the headmistress puts you on your honour not to associate with her
whoever speaks to her will be punished
do you understand
the headmistress asked me to tell you not to speak to manuela
the child must be isolated
– really
a boycott
that s never happened before
i ll speak to her
don t manuela will get the blame
we should tell the princess
that won t help matters
she s important what she says they do
i ll tell her
i don t care
where is manuela
hurry up
stand still
her highness has arrived
good afternoon
good afternoon fräulein von g rschner
how are you
– thank you very well
good afternoon fräulein von attems
ah fräulein von bernburg
how are you
– very well thank you
– mademoiselle oeuillet
comment allez-vous
– merci bien your highness
this is our new english teacher miss evans
– miss evans how are you
– thank you very well your highness
i m going upstairs to see the presentation
royalty is always beautiful to see
– don t forget to tell her
– i intend to
you must tell her now
yes child
what a lovely sight – so many happy children
without a doubt your highness
beckendorf
– yes my dear
i didn t forget
dear headmistress i d like to see the little beckendorf
fräulein beckendorf do you like it here
yes of course you do
meinhardis – yes what is her name
– meinhardis
oh yes right
dear headmistress the little meinhardis girl
i knew your mother
she was a very devout woman
i hope you ll try to be like her
you look very pale
i hope she s not ill dear headmistress
– no not at all your highness
what a charming girl
she will be the pride of the school
dear headmistress i d like to speak to you about the nursery school
– this way please your highness
– goodbye my ladies
goodbye children
such a big mouth and then you said nothing
well if the head hadn t been there – it s just ridiculous
– that wasn t the reason you are a coward
rubbish
i m too well brought up
no no
if it were not for her highness visit i would have expelled manuela this very day
excuse me headmistress but i see it differently
i know manuela and the others better than you
i m close to the children
i love them
and give them my petticoats
manuela was poorly supplied
if a girl hasn t enough clothes we write to her mother
the girl has no mother
edelgard
come here
come in here
such disobedience
i wouldn t have expected you to disregard the headmistress orders so blatantly
but i m so worried about manuela
she is so strange
listen to me edelgard
your friend isn t worth risking so much for
associating with her only harms you i m sure your parents would be very upset to know what a girl you are friends with
manuela is not bad
what you call sin headmistress i call the great spirit of love which takes a thousand forms
at this age young girls need someone to lean on
i will speak to manuela and rid her of her exalted ideas
exalted ideas
fräulein von bernburg don t you see that the contact between you and manuela must be dissolved
i forbid you to speak another word with manuela
– what is it
– i m so sorry
you should be sober by now
dear fräulein von bernburg
please no theatrics
very well
go to my room and wait for me
– did you see how pale manuela was
– yes terrible
when she curtsied i thought she d faint
manuela child
what is all this crying for
pull yourself together
don t be so feeble
come sit here
be reasonable now will you
what you have done you know
what you have done to me you know that too
we needn t mention it again
you re to be punished
you ll be locked away
not like prison just isolated
manuela don t be unfair
they are treating you mildly
you should have been expelled
the headmistress thought for a long time that would be best
but for once mercy has prevailed
fräulein von bernburg will i be allowed to see you
no manuela
but you won t abandon me
it s better for you
i m never to see you again
i couldn t live
manuela what sort of talk is that
you shouldn t think such things let alone speak them
you must be brought to your senses
you must be cured whatever it takes
cured
of what
you should not love me so much
why not
you must go now
i must go
there s no point in your staying any longer
i m going now
goodbye dear fräulein von bernburg
i must speak with you
you talked to her although i forbade it
yes i did
i can answer for it
i think i maintained the spirit of your order
if anything happened to manuela it would be very unpleasant for the head
is manuela with you
is she hiding
– this can t go on
– we must help manuela
this rebellious spirit comes from you
i will not permit revolutionary ideas
not while i am here
i won t cling to my post
i know i can t stay here
i can t stand by and see children made into scared helpless creatures
you go this way and we ll go here
– have you seen her
– where can she be
our father which are in heaven
hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us
lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory for ever and ever
amen
– all i hear is help her
– we re talking about a human being
you shall leave the school today
quick quick
have you all gone mad
what s the matter
what are the children doing here
– manuela wanted to throw herself down
we must thank god headmistress the girls have prevented a tragedy which we both would have regretted all of our lives

no but how long can a guy hold out

but you re not running away from me
come here
now you stay put if you know what that means
my bashful boy
you are different tommy
very different
and i ve discovered it isn t only a difference in manner and outward appearances
it s a difference in basic character
the men i know and i ve known dozens of them they re so nice so polished so considerate
most women like that type
i guess they re afraid of the other kind
i thought i was too
but you re so strong
you don t give you take
tommy i could love you to death

swimming with
jean taris champion of france
the sporting club de france kindly lent its pool to the filmmakers
now starting jean taris holder of 23 french records in all distances from 100 to 1 500 meters winner of the english championships for 500 and 880 yards and world record holder for the 800 meters
like a fish water is the swimmer s element
there are a few movements to learn but first just get in the water
you can t learn to swim in your room
one two three four i use a stroke called the crawl for both long-distance and speed swimming
a correct starting position is important
grip the edge firmly with the feet to avoid slipping and push off strongly with the legs arms extended
enter the water in an almost prone position
glide under the water and begin kicking as soon as possible
then the arms begin to work
the head should be held fairly high but relaxed
rotate the upper body
alternate strokes with the arms
kick with the legs well-extended
then the legs work more freely and independently of the arms
breathing underwater exhale deeply through the nose and mouth
inhale rapidly through the mouth on one side only at first
finally breathe on alternate sides every three strokes
as one arm rises the other carries you along
same principle for the backstroke
the leg movement is the same but the scull-like arm movement is a bit different
the arms stroke like oars alongside the body
besides the crawl other new competitive strokes are
to turn around touch the edge with one hand and further down with the other then turn around and push off with the legs

daddy buy me a bicycle
all my friends have bicycles

go ask your mother
she said yes since you get your bonus today
buy me something too
you already got those paper balloons
greedy baby
treat her like that and no bicycle
business is slow
we ll be lucky to get a month s pay
even a month s pay would be 120 yen
bonuses in president s office at noon
is it a good bonus this year
hoover s policies haven t helped us yet
don t go in now
it s occupied
bicycle parasol
necktie
this is good-bye
this is my last day here
why you re a senior employee with a pension starting next year
i moonlighted as an agent and sold policies to a few customers who met unfortunate fates
one died the day after buying a 20 000-yen policy
he was hit by a car
you didn t run him over it wasn t your fault
another died of typhus just months after buying a 10 000-yen policy
still that s no reason to fire you
it s wrongful termination
the boss has always been so good to me i don t want to make trouble
you should at least have a talk with him
they seem pleased the bonus was 20 % more than expected
of course we should protest
what are we waiting for
this isn t just about him
it s about us too
it s time to stand up for all of us working stiffs
you re full of fight
you go tell the boss
then again he lost the company money you can t blame the boss
are you sneering at me
in that case go talk to the boss yourself
you bet i will
hypocrite
i think it s the company s duty to pay even if a customer dies the day after buying a policy
why did you fire mr yamada
he s getting too old
it s really because his customers died right after taking out policies
are you telling me how to run this company
you re just an employee yourself mind your own business
i don t need troublemakers like you you re fired
it turns out this is my last day too
i m on my way to buy my son a bicycle
may i offer you some tea nearby
my daddy s buying me a better one today so there
my bicycle
that s more fun than a bicycle
no
it s no fun at all
suit yourself
i ll never buy you anything again
mom
she s out shopping for dinner
liar
i m not scared of you
fine
you want me to lock you up in the storeroom
he was a bad boy so i spanked him
he didn t buy the bicycle he promised me
daddy was wrong now be a good boy and stop crying
what did i do wrong
you shouldn t lie to children
he s been dreaming of a bicycle for so long
daddy s a liar
you are hereby discharged
i argued with the boss
i was right but of course he fired me
be a good boy and play with this okay
poor kid
let s buy him a bicycle

organization and progress that is our motto
this explains the success of our earlier factories it will be the same under our new enterprise which will now start up before your very eyes
won t you cut the garland
won t you cut this garland
cut it
step over here
all hail progress child of science
which extends its hand to the future
the golden torch of hope
it s very simple
we introduce the materials there
we stand back and then
there you have it
it guides its sister human intelligence
towards the sunlight
my congratulations
it s marvelous
ladies and gentlemen
on this solemn occasion when the machine has proven that if it can replace the hand of man it cannot replace his brain allow me first to pay homage to the brilliant creator behind the destiny of this magnificent factory
this man who despite humble beginnings forged a place for himself and earned the respect of his contemporaries whose name is forever linked with phonograph history this philanthropist this great citizen
this scoundrel this riffraff
it s him all right
- you recognize him
- you bet i do
i arrested him
if you want to arrest him again you d better hurry
he s been tipped off
he ll make a run for it
all right
get down there
this historic moment when the fiery gaze of the future looks back on the dazzling flame of the present
i haven t said everything
gentlemen the opening of this factory is my crowning achievement i have nothing more to do among you
i am leaving you
i hereby make a gift of my factories to all whose who have worked with me
the machines will now work for them
destiny beckons me to other paths
as a great poet once wrote
let us raise our souls and our hearts
as the mother raises her child
these words come to mind on this day when i wish
we can lift our heads high and declare that the future destiny of mankind seems to bear great promise
we will soon taste the fruit
when all things around us operate
friends let us enjoy our idleness
beneath sunny skies what a sweet fate
to laze about and sing like this
let s indulge in this infinite elation
it takes one kiss for it to start
my whole being finds exhiliration
in the gentle beating of your heart
you must never think of marrying when you were born to live on the road
while awaiting the wisdom age may bring think of love as a mere episode
that s our fate
old mate
my old friend the earth is round
there are women wherever you go
when we finally run out of ground that s the time to take it slow
everywhere if you take a chance
everywhere life is a melody
everywhere it s wine and romance
so here s to us two and liberty

i d wager your friend has something up his sleeve again dr lanyon
jekyll is always sensational always indulging in spectacular theories
gentlemen
london is so full of fog that it has penetrated our minds set boundaries for our vision
as men of science we should be curious and bold enough to peer beyond it into the many wonders it conceals
i shall not dwell today on the secrets of the human body in sickness and in health
today i want to talk to you of a greater marvel
the soul of man
my analysis of this soul the human psyche leads me to believe that man is not truly one but truly two
one of him strives for the nobilities of life
this we call his good self
the other seeks an expression of impulses that bind him to some dim animal relation with the earth
this we may call the bad
these two carry out an eternal struggle in the nature of man yet they are chained together
and that chain spells repression to the evil
remorse to the good
now if these two selves could be separated from each other how much freer the good in us would be
what heights it might scale
and the so-called evil once liberated would fulfill itself and trouble us no more
i believe the day is not far off when this separation will be possible
in my experiments i have found that certain chemicals have the power
tell me he can split me in two like a jolly amoeba
- by jove it s marvelous
- i confess it s too much for me
why don t you stay at home and send your other self to the lecture
to divide a human being in two
ridiculous
i m going to try to analyze my psyche
- i didn t expect you to agree with me
- agree with you
you talk like a lunatic
but i hope you re sane enough to remember that we have a consultation at the duchess of densmore s
- i m not going
- what
please give the duchess my compliments and some castor oil
i saw her yesterday
she s a bit bilious more in spirit than in body i m afraid
- i m going along the free wards
- my dear fellow be reasonable
you know how insistent the duchess was on your coming
you can t neglect her for a lot of charity cases
can t i
it s the things one can t do that always tempt me
just as you like
but you ll remember we re having dinner at the carews tonight
- i ll pick you up later
- thanks
you ll find me in the wards
see you at 9 00
mary what are you doing with those crutches
i can t do without them sir
yes you can do without them mary
i told you yesterday
believe me i can t do anything for you
i believe you sir but i can t walk without them sir
yes you can
give them to me
don t be afraid
now walk mary
come on
come to me
yes sir
walk mary
come on
all right sir
i can walk sir
- of course you can
- i can walk sir
there there mrs lucas
- it hurts doesn t it
- yes sir
sometimes a doctor must hurt you a little to make you well
yes sir
and if a doctor thinks a slight operation is necessary there s no need to be afraid is there
- no sir
- i want you to know it s going to cure you
i believe you sir
jekyll we haven t much time you know
i m sorry
i m afraid i must miss the dinner
i ll come afterwards for the dancing
- what s keeping you
- i must operate on this patient at once
why not leave it to one of the house surgeons
they re quite competent
perhaps but i prefer to do it myself
will you make my excuses to general carew and muriel please
as you like
lanyon you make my excuses to the general and i ll make mine to muriel myself
all right
yes miss muriel
will it be almond cakes with coffee hobson
- i m sorry miss i don t think so
- but we must have almond cakes
- send for them immediately
- very good miss
- what s this about almond cakes
- dr jekyll likes them father
you know you ll spoil that fiancé of yours
- i like spoiling him
- so i observe
and what about your father
you re already the most spoiled darling in the world
dr lanyon
lanyon
delighted to see you
punctual for dinner punctual in everything
how do you do sir
- what an astonishing motto
- how do you do
- where s jekyll
- he stayed to perform an operation
- isn t he coming
- he will be in after dinner
he asked me to make his excuses
i hope the patient is worthy of jekyll s attention
- a woman in the free wards
- free ward
jekyll gives entirely too much time to his charity patients
i love him for that
nonsense my dear
he ought to come down to earth
- mr utterson
- utterson
however i promised harry the first waltz
if he s late i shall be furious with him
no
you know i m very glad jekyll is late
i m obliged to him for a most delightful waltz
thank you
hello general
i m very sorry to be late sir
repentance is a virtue jekyll but it s better to be punctual
in 40 years i ve never been late for dinner
it s indeed a remarkable record sir
merely a matter of training my boy
at the age of
general you ve not forgotten this is our dance
certainly not lady dakin
i ve been looking forward to it
see you later jekyll
may i
- i shouldn t
- but you will
- was she pretty
- ravishing
- who
- your patient
i was thinking of someone else
someone to make you late again
- are you chiding me
- of course
- because you hate me
- of course silly
then will you come into the garden where i can bear it
- certainly not
- why not
- father
he d be furious
- it would do him good
he s not looking
he s teaching lady dakin how to waltz
- can t stay long
- just forever
not even half as long as that
now my farthing chide me mock me hate me but don t send me away
silly
are you sorry you were late
- no
- you re not
- if i wasn t late you wouldn t have pouted
- i won t forgive
if you hadn t pouted you wouldn t have looked so pretty
do you talk this way to your patients
if you hadn t looked so pretty i might have postponed
- pardon me
- not another word
well
i might have postponed telling you that i love you so much and i don t want to wait any longer
i want you to marry me now
darling i want to with all my heart
you know i do
but father s so difficult
i don t want to marry your father
i don t mind having a difficult father-in-law
you ll be worth it my darling
i don t think you love me seriously
i love you better than that
i love you gaily happily high-heartedly
i love you so much that i could laugh and sing and
i shouldn t spoil it by trying to sing
my darling i shall persuade your father to let us marry now
i can t wait any longer
we shall go to devon for our honeymoon and live on love and strawberries and the sight of the sea
- and moonlight
- endless moonlight
i do love you seriously
so seriously that it frightens me
you ve opened a gate for me into another world
before that my work was everything
i was drawn to the mysteries of science to the unknown
but now the unknown wears your face looks back at me with your eyes
darling i wish this moment would last forever
you can make it last dear
i love you
be near me always
always you and i
apart from the world
i love you darling
i love you
then who shall ever separate us
- my sweet friend
- my love
you ought to wear squeaky shoes hobson
yes sir
thank you sir
the general asks you to come into the house miss
- your guests are inquiring about you
- coming hobson
- glad you came
- good night muriel
- you looked perfectly lovely tonight
- thank you
- good-bye my dear
- good night general
i don t know when i ve enjoyed myself so much
- i ll see you at tea tomorrow dear
- yes
i won t forget lady dakin
- good night
- good night
jekyll my boy
waiting to see me
i beg your pardon sir but you would make us very happy if you d set an earlier date for our wedding
i ve already announced to you that you would be married on the anniversary of my own wedding
- that s eight months from now sir
- what of it
we ve already been engaged two months sir
we see no reason to
i presume i have some rights in the matter
- quite right
that s why we re asking you
- why this impatience
it isn t done
i m sorry sir but i cannot regard that as a serious objection
do you hear this lanyon
is this another evidence of your eccentricity
if it is eccentric to be impatient in love sir i am
this is positively indecent
father do you think it fair to keep us apart for so long
- i waited five years for your mother
- you have a sturdy temperament general
yes i pride myself on it
please don t make me wait that long for muriel
now my boy you must leave these matters to me
there s such a thing as decent observance you know
- good night
- good night sir
- good night lanyon
- good night sir
au revoir my sweet
come lanyon
- good night muriel
- good night
- i m afraid you offended the general
- offended him
it s a pity i didn t strangle the old walrus
did you hear him wait
what the devil does one wait for
i hope the responsibilities of marriage will sober you up
i m not marrying to be sober
i m marrying to be drunk
- drunk with love and life and experiments
- your experiments are absurd
you have no interest in science at all
you have no dreams no curiosities
there are bounds beyond which one should not go
yes
it isn t done i suppose
i tell you there are no bounds lanyon
look at that gas lamp
but for some man s curiosity we shouldn t have had it
london would still be lighted by linkboys
and wait
one day london will glow with incandescence and will be so beautiful that even you will be moved by it
i find london quite satisfactory as it is and i m not interested in your shortcuts and your byways
but it s in the byways that the secrets and wonders lie
in science and in life
look at the
fine you big brute hit me
i ll put the police on you
are you badly hurt
where does this girl live
first door on the left at the top of the stairs
bring her up here
make way for the governor
have you got her governor
- right up here
- yes
look out for her head
shut up you lot
what was this all about
- one of ivy pearson s callers
- i can tell you
now shut up
one of ivy
that swine
hit me will he
he ll wish he hadn t
i ain t afraid of him i ain t
blast his dirty mug
he s killed me that s what he s done
he s broken me jaw and me knee too
i ll get him for this
look where he kicked me
it s only a bruise
it will be quite well in a few days
either way you mustn t wear so tight a garter
it s bad for you
it impedes the circulation
it s awful kind of you to look after me
anybody can see now that you re a real gent you are
now you re the kind a woman would do something for
- what is it
- he s hit me here too the blighter
he s broken me rib
that s what he s done
i m going to faint
you re not seriously hurt
a bit of rest would do you no harm though
you think i ought to go to bed
i know of no better place for a rest
all right
you turn your eyes away now
how is the pain now
i say
lanyon
coming
i m a doctor you know and i ll call that kiss my fee
well
come back soon won t you
- sorry i m afraid i can t
- yes you can
soon
- good night
- come back
come back soon won t you
yes you can
soon come back
- i thought your conduct quite disgusting
- conduct
why a pretty girl kissed me
should i have called the constable
- even suppose i d liked it
- what
yes
that s not a matter of conduct but of elementary instinct
you ought to control those instincts
are you pretending that you either can or do
we may control our actions but not our impulses
perhaps you ve forgotten you re engaged to muriel
forgotten it
can a man dying of thirst forget water
did you know what would happen to that thirst if it were denied water
if i understand you correctly you sound almost indecent
what names you give things
why aren t you frank enough to admit that other indecent self in you
no
you prefer to hide it pretend it isn t there
- you have to accept certain things
- i don t want to accept
i want to be clean not only in my conduct but in my innermost thoughts and desires
- there s only one way to do it
- how
- separate the two natures in us
- that absurd theory of yours
i tell you it s unscientific not to admit the possibility of anything
you re mad
mad lanyon
we ll see
come in
what is it poole
begging your pardon for the intrusion sir but did you sleep last night sir
don t worry about me
yes sir but you had only a cup of tea for breakfast for three days
your health
now poole you didn t come here to inquire after my health did you
one of general carew s servants brought this sir
miss muriel is scolding me for having missed her dinner last night
go and tell her that i shall come to dinner tomorrow night
very good sir
marry me now
i cannot wait any longer
positively indecent
look where he kicked me
your conduct was disgusting
it isn t done
pity i didn t strangle him
strangle him
indecent
can a man dying of thirst forget water
disgusting
you re mad
come back soon won t you
come back
free
free at last
mad lanyon
carew
you hypocrites deniers of life
if you could see me now what would you think
- who is it
- who is there
dr jekyll sir
is that you
do you hear me sir
please let me in sir
i beg your pardon sir
i thought i heard a strange voice
that s quite all right
there was someone here
a friend of mine
his name is hyde
mr hyde
he s just gone out the back door
marry me now my darling
you don t know how much i need you
i want to with all my heart but father
- i ll speak to him
i ll convince him
- no let me talk to him
i ll try to change his mind while we re away
- away
- yes
darling i ve dreaded telling you but father s taking me to bath tomorrow
he has no right to take you away from me
why must we put up with this
- you want to marry me
- with all my heart
we ll marry without his consent
say you will my darling
we ll go to paris for our honeymoon
we ll be so gloriously happy that even the french will be jealous of us
i m so thrilled and tempted but i don t want to hurt my father
it s only a little hurt to his vanity
you ll do me a greater hurt if you refuse
do be patient just a little while
i m sure i can persuade him while we re gone
- darling don t you love me enough to wait a little while
- but muriel
of course i love you enough dear
and i ll wait
and wait
come in
a letter from bath sir
miss muriel won t be home for another month
- can t even go to see her
- i m sorry to hear it sir
- another month
- i beg your pardon sir but may i suggest that you ought to amuse yourself
amuse myself
what do you suggest poole
you ought to go out sir
london offers many amusements for a gentleman like you sir
yes but a gentleman like me daren t take advantage of them
gentlemen like me must be very careful of what they do and say
- that s all
- yes sir
here
what are you after down there
i was calling on the young lady who occupies the little nest
if it s ivy pearson you mean she ain t in
do you know where i can find her
if i was wanting her i d try the variety music hall
i thank you

what do you take me for

he ain t one to be trifled with
strike me pink
you interest me
i ll take a chance
- where is he
- i ll take you to him

but you are pretty
and what a figure my dear
a glass of champagne
to you my dear
to your beauty
- i must be going now
- going
where
- home
- you call that home
- that pigsty of yours in diadem court
- sty is it
you come off that
i like you when your temper s up my dear
how do you know where i live
i saw you on the street and followed you
my pretty you deserve better than that
you ought to live in a place worthy of you
buckingham palace i suppose
that s the spirit i like
sit down my dear sit down just for a moment
you should have a place that would set off that fine body of yours yellow hair and pale face
clothes to match too my dear
silk eh
and a bracelet too
champagne to drink
how would you like that
and how am i to get it
how do you think you re going to get it my bright little bird
i am no gentleman no but i have money
perhaps my looks don t please you
- you ain t no beauty
- quite right
i am no beauty
perhaps you prefer a gentleman
one of those fine-mannered virtuous and honorable gentlemen
one of those canting hypocrites who like your legs but talk about your garter
what are you talking about
my poor little innocent
it doesn t know what i m talking about
well it s afraid of me isn t it
- no i ain t afraid of you
- aren t you
good
hey you
trying to steal my girl are you you dirty blighter
- come back you
i ll fix you
- sit down
- i ll knock your blooming
- get out of here you
- you couldn t have done it
- couldn t i though
why not
this place was just made for it
- come on
- stop that
let me go
- no
you re not going
- let me go
i m going
i m going home
sit down
forgive me my dear
you see i hurt you because i love you
i want you and what i want i get
i grant you i am no beauty but under this exterior you ll find a very flower of man
look at me
do you suppose i d let anybody stand in my way
i love you
i love you
do you understand
you ll come with me
you ll come with me

- i presume your master is out - yes sir
so he is sir
he s always out when i call
tell your master i ve had a letter from general carew
he tells me that dr jekyll has not replied to any of miss muriel s letters
- she s worried about him
- i ll tell him sir
anyway i m relieved to know he s not confined to his bed
begging your pardon sir it s my opinion that my master isn t well
he hardly sees his patients sir
i haven t seen him myself for days at a time
he often comes and goes by the back door of the laboratory sir
i must be going poole

quite unworthy of our great love
no my dear i m not going now
i m going to spend the evening here with you just as you want

- just as i want
- that s right my little bird
the last evening is always the sweetest you know
and what a farewell this one will be
what a farewell

perhaps i shall go only as far as the door and the sight of your tears will bring me back
- does that please you my dear
- yes sir

why don t you dance
why don t you sing

come in
miss ivy pearson
- that s me

- not dr henry l jekyll
- quite so
he said there is no answer
good day miss
i don t know dr jekyll
fifty pounds
well he knows you dearie
strike me pink
fifty pounds from the celebrated dr jekyll
he s a grand gentleman always helping them what needs help
now dearie he sends you fifty pounds shows he takes an interest in you
why don t you go and thank the gentleman proper
then you could tell him all about this here hyde business
he ll tell that blighter what s what
you ll see if he don t
you made me suffer so
now you tell me nothing
i tell you no man ever needed another or loved another as i need and love you
i don t know what to say but if you d been ill that would have been different
i was ill my darling
why didn t you let me know
i should have come at once
i wasn t ill in body
i was ill in soul
the sufferings of the spirit are so difficult to communicate even to those who love you
do you think there s anything that has to do with you that i wouldn t understand
i know that you re gentle and understanding but
i can t explain to you
i ve played with dangerous knowledge
i ve walked a strange and terrible road
help me to find my way back
oh my sweet
when you re all mine to love and keep i shall be patient as the earth with you
then let s not wait any longer
let us be married at once
i want to with all my heart
take me
take me soon
i love you and i want to help you
muriel
i didn t expect to find you here sir
i ve just made my profoundest apologies to muriel
- what about me - permit me to make them to you sir and to trust that you will be indulgent
you haven t explained anything yet sir
i was not quite myself sir
i was ill
ill
in that case of course we ll say no more about it
thank you sir
may i take further advantage of your indulgence
- yes
what is it
- your consent to our early marriage
please father
do say yes harry needs me
- i ve already told you
- we re too unhappy apart
please father
this is the most important request of my life
- i see no reason to change my mind
- isn t my happiness reason enough
i assure you sir you will have no cause to regret it
to be frank jekyll i m not at all satisfied with your conduct
- i don t understand you sir
- i expect a man in your position to observe certain traditions
i want to see you more settled down before i entrust my daughter to your care
you re too flighty too impatient
believe me these faults will be corrected
- i give you my word of honor
- please father
my whole life is concerned
please
well i see you re overriding me
jekyll remember you gave me your word of honor
yes sir
very well
you shall be married next month
come to dinner tomorrow and we ll make a formal announcement to our friends
thank you sir
by jove you ve made me happy
- i could sing or dance or roll a hoop
- jekyll no
i beg your pardon sir
until tomorrow my sweet
- good-bye sir
- good-bye
poole my dear fellow
- i m a very happy man
- i m happy to hear it

jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
yes sir
may i take your cape sir
you may poole
you may my dear fellow
i m going to be married poole
in a few weeks she ll be under this very roof in this very room as my wife next month
think of it think of it poole and let me see your face
yes sir
i beg to congratulate you sir
- if music be the food of love play on
- yes
i beg your pardon sir but miss pearson is waiting for you in the consulting room
miss pearson
the young woman as you sent the envelope to sir
- what does she want
- she wishes to consult you sir
- very well
show her in here
- yes sir
- why it s you sir
- so it is
now who would have thought it
who would have thought that i d find the celebrated dr jekyll
- so it was you who sent me this money
- yes
the minute i laid eyes on you i knew you had a kind heart
- but whatever made you do it sir
- someone told me that you needed it
- who sir
- it doesn t matter
the important thing is that you have it
and you re welcome to it
i can t take it sir
- why not
- why
here s why
pretty ain t it
it s a whip that s what it is
horrible
i ll give you a lotion to soothe that
thank you sir but a lotion won t do the trick sir
no sir
it s more than that sir
i need help i do
i can t stand it anymore
- what is it my dear
- it s hyde sir
it s him that s done that and more as i can t tell you sir
he ain t human sir
he s a beast
he won t let me go and i m afraid to run away
i ve tried to drown myself but i can t
and if you don t help me you as had the kindest heart in the world sir then give me poison so i can kill myself
- why didn t you go to the police
- i was afraid
you don t know him sir
he ain t a man
he s a devil
he knows what you re thinking about
i m afraid of him now
if he knows as i ve been here today i don t know what he ll do
it won t be anything human sir
save me
keep him off me
i ll do anything you ask
i ll be your slave
help me
you are good you are
you won t let me go back to him will you sir
you re an angel
i ll do anything you like
i ain t as bad as you think and i ain t a bad looker either
i ll work for you i ll slave for you
i ll love you
you liked me once didn t you
why don t you
i give you my word that you will never be troubled with hyde again
no sir
he ll come back and kill me sir
he ll not come back
i ll see to it
but you don t know him sir
he ain t human he ain t
i ve given you my word and that i never break
you ll not see hyde again
believe me
i believe you sir
- you must go now
- yes sir
begging your pardon sir will it be a large affair
not particularly
general carew s cronies chiefly
they wouldn t regard the marriage as authentic unless it were formally announced at a dinner table you know
perhaps soon you ll be giving a formal dinner yourself sir
i may poole
- should i call the hansom sir
- no thank you
- a walk through the park will do me good
- yes
- we re early
- i m glad you are
my dear of course i wish you all happiness
- thank you dr lanyon
- how are you general
thou wast not born for death immortal bird
no hungry generations tread thee down
thou wast not born for death
no
thou wast not born for death
oh no
but it is dead
rather late
- it s very queer i did not hear
- i do not understand
of course he is a very busy man
he was probably detained
could anything have happened to harry mr utterson
on a night like this my dear
nonsense
why is he late then
there my dear
it s not his lateness
it s your impatience
he ll be along presently
i hope so
here s hoping that hyde rots wherever he is and burns where he ought to be
and here s hoping that dr jekyll will think of ivy once in a while
he s an angel he is
here s to you my angel
thought i wouldn t come back didn t you
you took the word of that sniveling hypocrite jekyll against mine
jekyll s word against hyde s
i know everything you do and everything you think
you went down on your knees before him the man i hate more than anybody in the world
- no
- no
i ll slave for you
i ll love you
you re an angel sir
you wanted him to love you didn t you
i ll give you a lover now
- his name is death
- no
it ain t so
ain t it so my little bird
my little starling
why you lying wench
you ve got his money here now
you must be the devil
there was nobody there but me and dr jekyll
he wouldn t have told you
no he wouldn t
wouldn t he though
wouldn t he
listen my dear
i m going to let you into a secret
a secret so great that those who share it with me cannot live
i am the angel whom you wanted to slave for and love
and i m going to take you in my arms now and hold you close
close my little lamb
my dove
my bird
there my sweet
there my dove
there my little bride
isn t hyde a lover after your own heart
there s something horrible happening up there
- did you hear it
- come on
- you murdering devil
- help
stop him
- the monster did this
- i know him
his name is hyde
- let me in
i m a friend of dr jekyll s

dr jekyll
with times as tough as they are we present a formula for cheap amusement
nightmares
first you eat a real lobster - not the kind they send to congress
then you add milk and mix in a horror story
we ve all heard of the worm that turned but this is the bookworm that turned - inside out
if you can work up a chill it helps
a little tomain poisoning will get your mind off your other troubles
when you get that feeling a cross between delirium tremens and the seven-year itch you know that something will come up any minute
a good nightmare always begins in a dark cellar with a coffin
a caretaker comes down to see that all the ghosts are locked up for the night
he d better keep away from the casket or he ll be coughing
but he doesn t care
you can see how brave he is
so he decides to ask the guy his name and how he feels
why it s dracula the guy who invented necking
the caretaker decides to run out and have a good fit
he s afraid that dracula may want a blood transfusion any minute but when he tries to go away he meets himself coming back
it looks as though he s having his ups and downs he acts like congress and always ends up where he started
this exercise is good for water on the knee water on the brain and other naval diseases
it is also a good way of enjoying the jitters without drinking alcohol
the poor fellow is afraid to go to bed so he sleeps in a hammock
dracula wants to start his stuff
he thinks he s clever but we see right through him
so the caretaker comes downstairs with a hatchet
i don t know how he got upstairs but anything can happen in a nightmare
dracula was a big cheese so he always had mice around him
so he hits dracula in the coffin
as usual dracula rises to the occasion
now he s got dracula sore and the caretaker hasn t a ghost of a show
the caretaker decides he might have been seeing things
maybe his near beer was nearer than he thought
no sir he was right
a guy with a face like dracula must be a spook or he d have his face lifted
and the worst of it is this spook looks screwy
there s nothing screwier than a screwy spook
he decides to retire
if i were in his place i d resign or at least quit
as the door blows open he gets the delicious aroma of fresh ghost
he gets an attack of the pivot disease
it s like the hiccups - the more you do it the more you have to
when you think you re over it you re just beginning
the only way to stop is to do it faster and tire yourself out
if you saw this sight in your bedroom maybe you d have a jitter or two
he s got it again
this is what s known as being several sheets in the wind
it s becoming a habit
pretty soon he ll wear out the sheet and he ll have to start on the mattress
then he ll get down to the rugs and they ll need new furniture
so dracula comes up close and shows us what the well-dressed ghost is wearing
he throws his silhouette on the wall and the wall is so scared it looks plastered
and now the blood may spurt any minute
gush gush
there is the profile that has won first prize in all the ghost beauty contests
when dracula was born his mother took one took at that face and had herself arrested
so he decides to go back to his coffin and sleep for 100 years until congress decides to do something about the depression
well well what a nightmare
think of having dracula and the monster from frankenstein in the same dream
he s asleep but maybe if we talk in his own language we can wake him
you see it s very simple if you know how to handle your monsters
this looks dangerous
hey doctor look out
he s awake
well it s too late
it looks as if the doctor is going to need a doctor
no we were wrong
the doctor s going to need an undertaker
the monster starts out to look for trouble
there s so much trouble these days he shouldn t have any trouble finding it
he can t decide which way to go
he s like a woman automobile driver
here s dracula
when he and the monster get together things should happen
what do you think of that
he s afraid of dracula
which proves that a monster can dish it out but he can t take it
who s this
why it s helen twelvetrees
maybe the nightmare is going to become a pleasant dream
no we re wrong
the monster is still looking for trouble
a man tells helen she has no business being in the same nightmare as dracula
but dracula s nearby and the gentleman s finish starts to begin to commence
meantime the monster is looking on and studying dracula s technique
helen is beside herself and now something else is beside her
there s nothing for helen to do but faint and wait for the nightmare to be over
dracula s income tax was due and he had to get some money
when night came helen had decided to call it a day
but she forgot to take her jewels off and they look like ready money to dracula
he has to be careful
helen is very ticklish around the neck
in fact it s a very ticklish situation
and of course the monster is taking it all in
but suddenly dracula throws caution to the winds and his fingers to the windpipe
finally the deed is did and helen awakes in her sleep
when helen tells the young man she saw a ghost he says he d like to see one too
well it s too bad
it looks as if his goose is cooked or his cook is hashed
dracula gets him and we hear the vampire eating his supper behind the wall
it s becoming tough
every time helen talks to a man dracula gets him
at this rate she could never get married - she d be a widow every 15 minutes
dracula has finished his entrée and is coming back for the dessert
the monster is still around and he s getting a lot of bad ideas
there comes dracula in disguise but we d know him anywhere
you can always recognise him by the fourth toe on his left foot
the monster thinks chasing women is a lot of fun
in fact he decides to try it himself
and here s little mae clarke
she s going to be married and as you see she s jumping with joy
in the background is the monster ready to try out dracula s technique
if mae had eyes in the back of her head she d faint
hey mae
it s
so she starts to run with the monster behind
they start to play follow-the-leader then it becomes ring-around-the-rosey
mae is so scared she s running around in circles
if her fiancé sees her he ll think she s nutty
she finally tells the monster she can t play anymore because she s got to be married
the poor monster is broken-hearted because nobody s afraid of him
he has to sit down all day because when he stands up his feet touch the floor
but finally he sees what he wants and decides to go after it
what can it be
maybe it s dracula
whatever it is he wants it
why it s our lobster-and-milk friend and look where he is
he d better look out or the monster will get him
it s a good thing he s waking up or he might fall and break his chandelier
and the moral of this story is
you can milk a cow but a lobster is very ticklish

- thank you doctor
well young man what seems to be your trouble
dr pierce i have a rather peculiar request to make
i want to sell you my body
why do you particularly want to sell it to me
well sir in view of your reputation on this side of the water i had an idea that my body in its present condition might be very interesting to you
before as well as after death
- what s the matter with you
- i ve been poisoned by radium emanations
- what is your occupation
- i m a commercial chemist
i ve been working on a process whereby the various radium products can be utilised without danger
how long have you been working on this thing
- ten or twelve years
- that s a very valuable idea
who made your diagnosis
i know enough about the symptoms to do it myself
- have you had any blood tests lately
- three weeks ago and again last night
i think i m good for another eight months a year at the most
i wish i could help you but i m afraid i can t
do you know anybody else who might be interested in my condition
look here doctor i need money very badly
why are you married
i wouldn t have come here if i weren t
- any children
- yes a little boy
- does your wife know about your condition
- she does
i told her last night
come to think of it i ve just heard from a friend of mine in germany
there s a specialist there named
what was that name
holzapfel
- been pretty successful in cases like yours
- holzapfel
at dresden
- yes
do you know him
- do i know him
he was one of my professors when i was studying over there
he was was he
doctor how much do you think it would cost
well the cure is said to take three or four months
i should say about $ 1 500
$ 1 500
- that s a lot of money isn t it
- it certainly is
- aren t you working
- only at odd jobs one or two days a week
let s see
i could let you have say $ 50
no doctor thank you
thank you so much for your patience
glad you came to see me
bedtime johnny
daddy can t i just stay up 10 minutes longer
no
- five
- no
- two
- no
alley-oop
wait a minute mummy
right in the bull s eye johnny
- which one are you going to tell me
- which one do you want to hear
- the one about germany
- but you ve heard that one so often
- i want to hear it again - ned
coming
- all set daddy - you bet
go on mummy
it was springtime in germany
it was springtime in germany and it was warm
i had spring fever and the air was full of blossoms
now it s your turn
let s see
i was out with some other students on a walking trip and pretty soon we came to a dragon sitting in an automobile who told us there was a magic pool in the forest
- and what did you do
- we went to the pool of course
- and what do you suppose we saw
- what
imagine
half a dozen princesses taking a bath
- and what did you do when you saw him
- i told him to go away
- and did he
- he did not
and what happened then
the most beautiful princess of all said that if i d go away she d grant me my wish
- and what did you wish
- i wished to see her again
i couldn t think of anything better to wish
so that night i went to a theatre and music began to play
and out upon the stage stepped this princess and she looked more beautiful than ever
she was beautiful
and then your heart began to go like this
and mummy began to sing
and my heart stopped beating entirely
what happened to you when you saw him
i could hardly sing and i could barely wait until i saw him again
but you did see him again didn t you
i met him later that night
- what happened then
- you can never guess
- we went walking
- go on walk
okay skipper
and then we came to a park
only there was a tremendously large yellow moon up in the sky
it was altogether too big and too bright
but it was dark under the trees very dark
this is a tree johnny
- and what happened under the tree
- then he kissed me
- and what happened after that
- he kissed me again
and what happened then
then we were married
and then
and then we started to think about you
get out of here
would you need that $ 1 500 all at once
no but if i had $ 300 i could at least get to germany
i haven t yet figured out a way of paying the rent unless i part with the microscope
so i m afraid we ll have to postpone our trip abroad this year
i could earn that money by going back to the stage
i won t have you do that
but the doctor says you must go away
if i worked a few weeks i might make enough for your passage
and then we ll find a way to keep you over there until you get well
it s out of the question
i won t have you go back to the stage
- ned
- what is it
i was going back to my old work anyway
- will it make you happy
- it isn t that
we need money
it s only a question of weeks
my formula is almost completed

[ singing ] did you ever happen to hear a voodoo

tom-toms put me under a sort of hoodoo
and the whole night long i don t know the right from wrong
hot voodoo black as mud hot voodoo in my blood
that african tempo
has made me a slave
hot voodoo dance of sin hot voodoo worse than gin
i d follow a caveman
right into his cave
that beat gives me a wicked sensation
my conscience wants to take a vacation
got voodoo head to toes hot voodoo burn my clothes
i want to start dancing just wearing a smile
hot voodoo i m aflame i m really not to blame
that african tempo is meaner than mean
hot voodoo makes me brave i want to misbehave
i m beginning to feel like an african queen
those drums bring out the devil inside me
i need some great big angel to guide me
hot voodoo gets me wild oh fireman save this child
i m going to blazes
i want to be bad
- not bad eh henry
- i should say not
- where d you dig her up o connor
- how do you like her boys

i need some too
we have a big day ahead of us

she s married
- married
- and what s more she s got a kid
- and her husband s gone to europe for his health - a kid
- for his health
- he sailed three weeks ago
she ain t been home all day and neither has the kid and nobody knows when she ll be back
maybe something s happened to them
and me picking a winner for the first time this year
blooie goes my 15 %
why the next one i get i ll nail down if i have to marry her
what s the idea of sending for me in a rush
hello taxi
how are you darling
- what s wrong
- there s nothing wrong
i got a swell new number all lined up for you
i want you to start rehearsing it this afternoon
yeah
there s a catch in this somewhere
hello
o connor i meant to call you up yesterday but i didn t get around to it
miss jones isn t going to work for you anymore
what s the idea
she can t quit me like this
- who s that
- nick townsend
after me giving her all this publicity and working up a swell following for her
do you happen to have a contract with miss jones
- do you have that dame under contract
- have i got a million dollars
i don t need no contract with my artists
my word s as good as my bond and i stand to lose a lot of dough if she don t show up
you ought to see the drop in my business the last two days she hasn t been here
i ll talk to you about that later
meantime you just forget about miss jones
o connor s isn t a fit place for you to be seen in night after night
besides you got johnny to look after now
who s going to take care of him if you keep on working
you can t make enough money there anyway to send to your husband unless you meet another sucker like me
and there s another thing i want you to do
a friend of mine has left town and his apartment is empty
i suggest that you and johnny spend the summer there
it ll do both of you a lot of good
what do you expect for all of this
nothing
i like you that s all
and i think you ve got a swell kid
and i m trying to help you both out of a tight spot
there s no use trying to fool myself or you helen
i m crazy about you and i want you to like me too if you can
you re making it difficult for me not to
come on honey give me a little kiss will you just a little one

- no i didn t see mrs faraday
- was she here again
- yes she was here again
- she s living now with her sister you know
- her sister - i thought it was her aunt
- maybe you are right

- yeah maybe it was her grandmother
- anything the matter
- he s coming back

- in about a month
- completely cured
- yes he s well now
- what are you going to do
- go back to him
- do you want to
- he s my husband

a little of you is worth a lifetime with any other woman
let s end this thing right helen
can we end it right
let s go away for a couple of weeks together just you and i
i don t understand
haven t you seen her doesn t she come here at all
sure i have
she generally comes around here two or three times a week for her letters
but this time i haven t seen her for 10 days
two weeks mr faraday
- ten days
- two weeks
if you don t shut up i ll give you a bust in the mouth
two weeks mr faraday
go on sweep the cellar
- we have to go back today don t we - yes
there s a boat leaving for europe tomorrow morning
i can t stay in the same city with you without seeing you
- how long will you be gone
- i don t know
a year a couple of years
till i forget you
i wish i were someone else
then i could stay here with you forever
so do i helen not only for my sake but for your own
- there s trouble ahead of you
- i know it
she worked here for three weeks and then she quit
i ain t seen or heard of her since
in this business they come and they go
but she wrote me you put her under contract
raised her salary to $ 150 a week
- she did
- now i know where i ve seen you
you re the guy whose picture venus had on her dressing table
- do you know where she is
- no i don t know
- but you ask a guy named nick townsend
- shut up if you know what s good for you
don t mind her
she s cracked
wish i could help you locate your dame brother
but i don t know a thing
in this business they come and they go
- helen
- ned
where s johnny
where ve you been
what s happened
it s been awful coming here finding you gone not knowing where to look for you
your letter said you were staying another month
but i cabled you a week ago
where have you been
where s johnny
i m crazy to see him
i ll bring him as fast as i can we didn t know you were here
where is johnny
you haven t lived here for months
what s happened
if someone were to say i d been untrue to you would you believe it
what do you mean untrue
i had planned to lie about it
the money you needed i didn t get it the way i told you
- a man gave it to me
- is his name townsend
it doesn t matter
so when you told me the manager had given you an advance and raised your salary
it was a lie
why did you do it
how else could i have obtained money so quickly
i ought to be grateful to you i suppose
how much do i owe you and him for my life
ned
how much beside the $ 1 500 i ve gotten from you
how much that s all
i ll see that you get it back
that s simple enough isn t it
yes
well what next
i m here if you ll have me
go on as before
you saved my life and i m very happy
let us go and thank this gentleman for his kindness to us
or would you rather i shoot him dead
it doesn t matter
he s not to blame
the minute i was out of sight you took up with the first man who could give you the things i couldn t
what puzzles me now is why you should want to come back to me
- i love you ned
- send johnny back here and clear out go on
what are you waiting for
are you going to take johnny away from me
you ve been a rotten mother to him
you re through with him
the law will give him to me if you don t
if you and your friend try to put up a fight for him i ll take the case to court
and you ll find out soon enough who s entitled to the custody of the child
i ve been a good mother to johnny
let s not dispute that point helen
johnny s all i ve got left
bring him here or tell me where he is and i ll get him myself
no i ll bring him here
- baltimore car please
- baltimore car next car 118
what can i do for you
i want the police to help find my wife and child
they ve been missing two days

doctor lawyer
i give up

and a little dangerous too
i got to hand it to you baby you almost hit the nail right on the head
i thought so
who are you after a bank robber
not this time
just a woman and a kid
but she s given us one of the longest and toughest chases we ve ever had
how do you know she s in this neck of the woods
i know all right i got the whole border covered
she hasn t got a chance in the world
you say she got away from you before
yeah i ll have to hand it to her
i had her all sewed up in baton rouge or at least i thought so
but she leaves a hot trail behind her
the faster she has to travel the faster she has to work
you ought to hear some of the suckers squawk
she takes them like grant took richmond
i was only one day behind her in savannah
but she played a one-night stand on me and beat it down here while i was following a chump steer all the way up to memphis and back for the last month
well she had a bit of a rest anyway
you sympathise with her don t you
well i don t
she ought to get wise to herself
the way she s living now isn t doing that kid any good
some people might call it mother-love but i don t
what does a man know about mother-love
come on let s go
that s just what i was thinking
i m getting sick and tired talking about that dame
got anything to drink at home
you better take something along

you ve got your badge on your face not under your coat
you and your whole crowd
you could never have caught me not in a thousand years
and now get out
and don t forget to tell that husband of mine that i m giving the kid up
not because he hounded me into it but because i m no good

no good at all you get me
no good for anything
except to give up the kid before it s too late
- daddy

i ve been wanting to pay this for a long time
it s what i owe you for my life
it would have been better helen if you d let me die
you might as well know what that money means to me
it represents my life work
had i been able to exploit it properly i could have made a fortune
but i sold my rights and now we re quits
stay away from johnny for good
give him a chance to forget you
that s the only way you can be a good mother to him now
johnny will you go over and say goodbye to mother

i for one don t think i ll sit through it
say what do you happen to know about this helen jones
you don t mean to tell me you re interested in her
i didn t say i was did i
they say she came over from south america about five months ago
when she got here she used man after man as a stepping stone
then all of a sudden paris went wild over her
that s all i know except they say she s as cold as the proverbial icicle
- that s pretty cold isn t it
- it s cold enough for me
hello helen
well if it isn t old nick himself
i expected you to pop up some day
if this is a dream helen i hope i never wake up
let me come backstage will you
i seem to remember you came backstage once before
[ singing ] if the moon began to waltz
or the sun did somersaults
do you think i d care or stop and stare
i couldn t be annoyed
if the hens refused to lay
or if bulls gave milk some way
do you think i d care
that s their affair
i couldn t be annoyed
if everyone stood on his head
and on his hands he wore shoes
i d still eat crackers in my bed
what have i got to lose
if you ate soup with a fork
or if babies brought the stork
do you think i d care
i d still declare
i couldn t be annoyed
crowd bravo
well nick did you succeed in forgetting me
forget you
i should say not
i haven t stopped thinking about you a single day since i last saw you
how long has that been
must be more than a year now
it certainly is great to see you again helen
how have you been how did you happen to come to paris
how long have you been here
thank you i ve got a million questions to ask you
better not ask them nick
i d rather not talk about the past
well let s talk about the present
are you happy
are you in love with anybody
i m not in love with anybody and i m completely happy
funny isn t it
no it s tragic to me
wish i were necessary to your happiness
but i guess i never did mean much to you
maybe you did
anyway nothing means much to me now

no
well chuck all this and come back to america with me
come on helen give me a break too
my life isn t complete without you
as soon as we land i ll manage it so you can see johnny
let s forget all that
i don t want to see johnny again
what for i d go to pieces
excuse me please but they are calling for madame
it is marvellous
the house is sold out for two months in advance
you see nick
i couldn t leave even if i wanted to
drop in again before you go
i don t think i will
goodbye helen as you like
give my regards to new york
i m going to reserve a cabin for you helen in case you change your mind
the boat train leaves tomorrow at midnight
without me
sorry about the pudding
you see i never tried making one before
it s pretty good daddy if you only eat the middle
johnny do you know who that is
no who is it
do you remember mother johnny
sure i do
is that her picture
- i don t think i can do it nick - nonsense you ve got to see him
come in
- what is it you want
- my name s townsend
- who - nick townsend
i suppose you have a very good reason for coming here
as a matter of fact i have mr faraday
your wife wants to see johnny
- where is she
- right outside the door
johnny who s that daddy
it s bedtime
start undressing will you johnny
i ll be with you in a few minutes
do you mind going now mr townsend
i m very tired so you have no intention of allowing helen to see the boy
no
look here faraday
i m going to marry helen
i ve just read the papers
congratulations
between you and me i wish she hadn t wanted to come here
but she s out there waiting
i ve been teaching johnny to forget his mother
it s been a pretty tough job and i don t intend to have my work spoiled
i see
you re not so very well off financially are you
that s nobody s business but my own
would it be worth let us say $ 1 000 to let her see him for 10 minutes
$ 100 a minute
surely mr townsend you can afford to be more liberal
i ll raise it to $ 1 000 a minute
$ 10 000
how about it faraday
i suppose you feel pretty good the way you can throw money around
$ 10 000 for 10 minutes doesn t mean very much to you does it
it doesn t mean anything to me
i can throw money around the same as you can
let her come in for nothing
come in helen
johnny s in the bedroom
gee mummy
- oh johnny
- i m glad to see you mummy
where you been mummy
daddy told me you were never coming back

- father knows it better than i do
- but he says he s forgotten it
ask him again
oh dad
what is it johnny
mummy says you do too know the story about germany
- i told you i ve forgotten it
- but try to remember it
it was springtime in germany and you were out on a walking trip
well let s see
i was out on a walking trip with some other students and as i remember it i was very happy
and then what happened
i ve forgotten
don t you remember you came to a dragon sitting in an automobile
yes i remember that
and you went and saw a lot of princesses taking a bath didn t you
yes i suppose i did
what did you do then
i told him to go away but he wouldn t until i granted him a wish
what was the wish
he wanted to see me again
you didn t want any other wish did you
no i was very sentimental in those days and very foolish
why were you foolish
that night you went to a theatre didn t you
yes i went to a theatre
and then you saw mummy on the stage and she was very beautiful
and then your heart went like this
i didn t know much about women in those days
you re telling it all different
you tell it mummy
what happened when you saw him
- i don t know johnny dear
- don t you remember mummy
i could hardly sing
what happened then
you could never guess
we went walking
please walk mummy
and then you came to a park and there was a dark tree and a yellow moon
you re not doing it right at all
you re supposed to kiss each other
better be a good boy and go to sleep johnny
- your mother s got to go away now
- all right daddy
let me stay with you both ned
that s where you belong helen
are you bad luck
hiya doctor
hiya babe
- hey where are you going
- inside inside
no you ain t only stiffs go in there tonight
- no kidding
- no kidding - what s keeping you out
- i m
what - listen we re pals ain t we
- yeah get a flash of that
yeah well it won t do you any good tonight
now look i got me orders
nobody s going in there and that goes for you newspaper guys too
now sergeant all i want to do is identify a body
now look walk down the street because somebody might think i know you
- go ahead
- that s an idea
- hello dee
- hello
- say say what s the hurry big boy
- i just want to use your telephone
oh yeah well there s one down at the corner drugstore
listen i haven t got time
will you be a sport come on act natural
all right but step on it
this is no telephone exchange
haven t i
say didn t i meet you in havana
yes
hello world
give me the night desk please
yeah
willard keefe
yeah this is lee taylor i m down at the mott street morgue
just now they bring in the body of an old scrubwoman murdered under very peculiar circumstances
no they won t let me see it
i can t get any dope police
very good
i say very
what
i say i can t get any dope on it
police orders just now stevens o halloran and a guy named dr xavier arrived
- something s doing
- yeah i ve heard that one too
listen you lunkhead i m not clowning look out the window will you
- what do you mean the moon
- certainly i mean the moon
i m laying 10 bucks to a dime it s another moon killer murder
well that s different
now listen lee stick right on it
fine
i thought i
oh rachmaninoff
how about the prelude huh
hey mike just a minute please
hello mike
hey listen what s going on across the street tonight
i don t know a thing lee
i m walking my beat and minding my own business
- well have you got a cigarette
- i never use them here smoke this
paddy the bartender down at the corner gave it to me
- oh much obliged mike thanks
- yeah no problem
- good gracious
what you got there - nothing just a little handshake buzzer
you see fits right in the palm of your hand
you wind it up like that and it discourages these professional handshakers
i ought to have one on each hand for my beat here
- well i gotta be going now
goodbye
- so long i forgot all about that thing
don t ever bring any of those darned tricks around here again
what s your theory doctor
strangulation by terrifically powerful hands
you will notice how deeply the thumbs are embedded in the sternocleidomastoid
and what do you think of this incision at the base of the brain
obviously made by some type of scalpel used for brain dissecting
but it s peculiar that this left deltoid muscle should be missing
- it s been torn right out
- gentlemen it wasn t torn
this is cannibalism
- this portion of the body was
- impossible there s no doubt about it
thank you doctor i appreciate your professional opinion
i m only too happy to be of any service to you gentlemen
now if you ll excuse me i have rather an important experiment in progress that demands my attention every few hours
i hardly think i can be of any further use to you so if you don t mind i m very very sorry but i ll say good night
just a moment doctor if you don t mind
one thing more
- very well sir
- yes what now look here doctor this is the sixth murder in the same number of months all committed in the full of the moon with no apparent motive by means of strangulation and an incision with a strange surgical knife
- yes it is peculiar isn t it
- most peculiar
- what s your theory of the killer doctor
- a neurotic of course
- some poor devil suffering from a fixation
- fixation
what do you mean a knot or kink tied to the brain by some past experience
a madness that comes only at certain times when the killer is brought in direct contact with some vivid reminder of the past
- it s hard to believe that
- yes for a policeman i suppose it is
but i tell you that locked in each human skull is a little world all its own
yes well what would these reminders be for instance
anything the sight of the sea the full moon
anything
the poor devil sane at all other times is forced to live over the scene of the action that first drove him mad
very interesting
particularly in view of the fact that all these murders occur in the vicinity of your medical academy
are you implying that someone in my academy could have done this
- i am convinced of it
- this is preposterous
i m familiar with the character of every student and professor and they re all men of the highest integrity
there are other academies in the state
but they don t have that kind of knives
the surgical supply house swear they import them from vienna especially for your institute
it s the only place in the country that they re used
commissioner stevens if you jump at a hasty conclusion like this you ll ruin the integrity of an institution that has one of the finest reputations in the world
i m sorry doctor but i have to start an investigation
i tell you this first because i m hoping for your cooperation
naturally i shall do everything to protect your institution
- but the newspapers the publicity
- don t worry about them
we don t want publicity any more than you do
if my academy is under suspicion give me a chance to conduct an investigation of my own first
surely with our knowledge of the human brain
- we have every facility to catch a madman
- how would you proceed
by immediately studying the pathological reactions of every man placed under suspicion
then trap the guilty one by a brain examination
may i examine the records of your students and faculty
why assuredly assuredly you can come to my office now if you wish
but i beg of you no publicity please
- no don t worry
- please not one newspaper in the country shall hear of this until you ve had every opportunity to clear your academy of suspicion
thank you
thank you i appreciate your gesture
what is it
what do you want
- father
- oh it s you joanne
what is it dear
nothing i just came in here to say good night to you
father what are you doing in here in the dark
you frightened me i m sorry joanne
i just came here to get those records
it s late
you re looking very tired darling
you re only heading for a nervous breakdown unless
that moon mixed with this other light it s too ghastly
father you worry me
you promised me you d take a rest
lately you ve been so
no my dear i m all right
just a little nervous that s all
now i have some gentlemen next door in the office
- you run along i ll be through shortly
- but father
now joanne please
this is very important
good night
but really gentlemen this investigation is useless
the academy is closed
the students are away on their vacations
it surely isn t wise to spend your time on this
what s that
probably professor wells
he s in his laboratory
what s he doing here if the school s supposed to be closed
it s not an unusual thing for the faculty to spend their evenings here at this time
vacation period is the only opportunity they have to do their personal research work
what s the history of this man
- well
- i m waiting doctor
professor wells is a student of cannibalism
he s written a book about it
why didn t you tell us this before
it s as good as a conviction
i hardly think so
i m very fond of dr wells
he couldn t possibly do a thing of this sort
- may i talk to him
- why certainly
certainly come this way gentlemen
what a very strange uncanny place you have here doctor
what are all these doors
they are the laboratories of my faculty
dr wells dr duke dr rowitz dr haines
and all those men are here at this hour of the night
they seldom leave
they live for their work
after all this is a research institute
i should like to have a little talk with these gentlemen
of course
i m sorry to disturb you professor wells but i would like to introduce some friends of mine
- may we come in
- of course of course gentlemen
come in come closer
- this is mr stevens
mr o halloran
- professor how do you do
how do you do
that s interesting isn t it
if this experiment is successful we will be a little nearer the secret of life
what is that
that s a heart
i ve kept it alive for three years by electrolysis
electrolysis
professor wells is accomplishing remarkable findings in nerve reflexes
- you flatter me doctor
- oh no no i understand professor that you live just for your work
- that you seldom leave the institute
- not necessarily
i played truant a short while ago
i was down by the waterfront for a breath of air
- what time was that
- you re not feeling well
- your arm is troubling you
- yes it s very annoying
well you re foolish to sit there in discomfort
- lf you gentlemen don t mind i
- why of course not of course not
i put it on just as i heard you coming
an empty sleeve is revolting to most people
well i think we ve taken up enough of professor wells time
- oh not at all mr stevens
- thank you professor
well gentlemen shall we be going
there are many other interesting things to see
yes let s be going
- good evening
- good night
thank you for calling
you know this is a tough case
there isn t much chance of his strangling anybody with one hand
- oh i agree with you
- well that lets him out of the picture
- whose room is that
- professor haines
is there anything about him that might justify my putting him under observation
well of course if you re just looking for someone to hang suspicion on there s not a man on my faculty that wouldn t come under that heading
then you do know something about this man haines
- no not exactly except
- except what
- well
- come on come on
well what is it
dr haines and two other scientists were shipwrecked off tahiti about a year ago while making a study of the coral reefs for the killary foundation
now what s that got to do with it
- you say they were shipwrecked
- yes they were adrift for 24 days
their supplies were exhausted
when they were picked up haines and one other were delirious
the third had vanished
there was no explanation at the time
haines later claimed the man had died and he had thrown the body overboard
- i should like to meet him
- surely but i am sure that he s not the guilty party
the killer is a maniac and dr haines is one of the most brilliant men in the medical world
- however if you insist
- i do
very well
professor haines
yes yes yes come in
come in doctor
i want you to meet mr stevens and mr o halloran
they re making a tour of scientific investigation and intend to honor our academy for a short time
- how do you do gentlemen
- hope we re not disturbing you professor
not at all i was just relaxing
professor haines is a most intensive worker
i ve just been telling mr stevens of your phenomenal experiments in brain grafting
oh doctor doctor come come i want to show you
i want to show you a new type of brain cell
- that should be interesting professor
- i m sure you ll find it so
- on the slide
- yes
look
relaxing
why did you bring the police in here
get them out quickly or i ll
professor do you experiment with all these animals
mankind s benefactors
those little animals whose blood most nearly resembles the human
yes
yes yes of course
of course
but it s getting rather late professor and mr stevens wants to see the rest of the laboratories
now that he s met you he can call some other time
- delighted - thank you professor
- glad to have met you
good night
- good night good night gentlemen
there s always a certain amount of danger in a laboratory so
he s certainly a strange type
well such men are naturally strange mr stevens
sometimes in the overdevelopment of one part of the brain another part is weakened
there s a type who looks capable of anything
oh i assure you he s as timid as a lamb
he s inclined to be attentive to my daughter so i see a lot of him
- who s the next
- dr rowitz
he s the scientist who was with haines during the shipwreck
if you ll step this way
- are you busy dr rowitz
- always but it s a pleasure gentlemen
oh excuse me
mr stevens
mr o halloran
- how do you do
- how are you - can i be of any service
- well we are just looking around doctor
- oh yes of course - good evening professor duke
- how are you feeling tonight
- horrible well i m sorry to hear that
well if it makes you feel sorry to hear things like that then don t ask questions
oh professor duke mr stevens mr o halloran
how do you do
how do you do he s dr rowitz s collaborator
you re an astronomer doctor
not that sir
i have an interest in the light qualities of the moon
if you might suffer sunstroke might you not suffer some similar evil
- from the rays of the moon
- moonstruck you mean
exactly what we call lunacy from the word luna meaning the moon
latin you know
however the luna rays will never affect you or me sir
- because we are normal people
- sure it affects strangely certain neurotic types
yes moon is powerful
why twice a day it lifts billions of tons of water at high tide that wash the shores of the world like an eternal old scrubwoman
like what
pardon my poetic effort
yes but just what do you mean by that
i m afraid we ve taken up too much of dr rowitz s time
thank you doctor
that was very very interesting
- good night gentlemen
- good night
- good night
- good night you know this is the doctor s particular hour for observation and the moon doesn t wait you know
did you notice the face on that fellow
that sailor who saw the scrubwoman killed tonight says the murderer had a face that was horribly disfigured
rowitz certainly fits the description all right
gentlemen i don t believe that dr rowitz could commit a crime
he has such a lovely nature
why he s the author of several volumes of poetry
hello
- what are we gonna do
- we re powerless unless he helps us
you know that as well as i do
we ve exhausted every clue
he can help us find the murderer if anybody can
and i m gonna put plenty of pressure on him and make him do it
a little nervous perhaps but nothing more
oh ridiculous
all right all right
you go back to sleep dear
good night
doctor if i permitted you to conduct your own investigation how long would it take you
if you leave me alone
i can conduct a series of tests which in 48 hours will conclusively prove whether or not the killer is a member of this academy
in the meantime i should like to check up on all your collaborators
who s there
hey what re you doing up there
i m a building inspector
i work nights so i won t get sunburned
i asked you what are you doing up there
i m a somnambulist
i probably came up here to have my head examined
you come down from there or i ll
now just a minute i ll be right down honey
just relax everything is gonna be all right and on the up-and-up
i m not used to these
these fire escapes are a sideline with me
now everything is gonna be
there s nothing to worry about
see police commissioner stevens is upstairs and i m taking care of the outside
- by the way what are you doing here
- i m miss xavier and we re not accustomed to having strange men climb all over our fire escapes
i m not accustomed to having strange girls sticking guns in my stomach
by the way you re just the person i wanna see
i wanna ask you a few questions
could you tell me the whereabouts of your father during the last four hours
how do you spend your evenings i mean have you ever noticed the doctor acting strangely
i m sorry but i can t answer those questions
the doctor hasn t been very well lately and i don t like policemen or anyone to disturb him
- good night
- just a minute
- have you got a permit to carry that gun
- yes i have
good night
all right
i ll agree to lay off for 48 hours
but i give you my word if you don t succeed i ll come in here seal every door place everybody under technical arrest take fingerprints conduct a rigid inspection
i don t care if the whole world knows it
there have been six murders committed all in the same circumstances
the evidence points here
- but commissioner all i want is a chance
- you ve got it
- forty-eight hours
good night doctor - good night
good night gentlemen
meddling fools
this way out gentlemen
if you please
- who re you
- i am dr xavier s butler sir
my nerves are all shot
that dumb potbellied flat-footed cop
i dashed that off in five minutes
i think it s pretty swell
- what do you think
- it s okay
but you stick on dr x s trail and you get a picture of the doctor and a statement too
oh no not me
listen i wanna get off this story
put me back on crossword puzzles covering woman s clubs
- anything will you
- say what s the matter with you
what s the matter with me
nothing at all only i spent all last night laying next to a bunch of stiffs looking at a lot of goofy guys
i let a dame poke a gun in my stomach and then i let a dumb policeman slip me a trick cigar
say you want to draw another paycheck don t you
certainly that s my aim in life but i d like to keep out of the bughouse to enjoy it
eddie when is lee taylor s week up
oh wait a minute wait a minute
can t you take a joke
all right keep moving but get a picture of the doctor
here have a cigar
how do you do
i m mr taylor
- you ain t a reporter are you
- i should say not
well that s good
we ve been overrun with them all morning
- gee they got us goofy
- i know just how you feel miss xavier
- i ain t miss xavier
- well that s funny
i was told that she was a good-looking girl of about 20
i m 21-and-a-half
oh fine
pleased to meet you
gee ain t you the kidder though
that s another thing in your favor
that shows that you have a sense of humor
what do you want the miss for
- my grandmother sent me
- your grandmother
won t you take these flowers
- for the miss - come in
just a minute
miss joan there s a man down here wants you for his grandmother
- i beg your pardon
- oh how do you do
i didn t know you
i m awfully sorry
you know i felt sure that i d hear you coming before you entered
well i suppose i could go back and cough
oh no no please don t bother
stay right here
- you re sure i m not disturbing you
- not at all why do you ask
you re so obviously at home here that i feel like a guest
- you don t mind if i sit down
- oh please do
oh how nice thank you
and since you re my guest won t you
- won t you want a cigarette
- no what i want is to know if you re really going to take it
- going to take it
- yes my picture
it s sticking out of your right pocket
well isn t that the funniest thing
you know this is really all your own fault
you have absolutely no business photographing so attractively
- thank you
- and i have a habit of collecting pictures
- of beautiful girls
- yeah - well and pictures of their fathers too
- pictures of their fathers
what fathers
my father s picture s sticking out of your left pocket
well can you beat that
how do you suppose that got there
just who are you anyway
because you re such a good scout i m gonna break down and confess and tell you
i m lee taylor of the daily world
- then you did it
- me it was you who printed that horrible story of father in this morning s paper
- horrible
you ain t read nothing yet
- what do you mean
what i mean is
well don t you see
your father s a famous scientist
he s been called in on a sensational case
- that s news
- but you ve upset him terribly
now on account of that newspaper story he has to go some other place to carry on his investigation
- he hates publicity
- you mean to tell me he s leaving town
who s going with him
what time are they leaving
- what station
- that s none of your business
i refuse to say another word to you
you re just contemptible and impudent enough to publish it
oh impudent maybe but not contemptible
- don t call me contemptible
- you are contemptible
you deliberately fooled me last night into believing that you were an officer
well i merely showed you my police press badge
don t you think you ve been here a very long time
listen honestly i am ashamed
but don t you see
this is the biggest thing that s happened in this town in six months
if i don t get something on this story why i ll have to join the army of the unemployed
- and you wouldn t want that to happen
- i d be very grateful to you if you d leave
i didn t quite get that
yeah would you say it again
a little closer you hard of hearing
no no but don t you see
that s the closest thing to anything coaxing that you ve said yet
- you get out of here
- oh don t be angry
come on let s laugh it off
- won t you shake hands and be friends - no
lucky
i ve got to get something on this story or i m out of a job
hey
take this home to your grandmother
bad luck
there is no need to be temperamental
we are here on a matter of the utmost gravity
that s why i ve sent for you so unceremoniously
we are all under suspicion of murder
- what
- absurd
- ridiculous
- what imbecile thought that up
gentlemen i know you re all acquainted with these recent horrible murders
moon killer murders as the press calls them
the investigation has proven that in every case the killer has made use of a surgical instrument a type to be found only in our academy
- but doctor
- one moment please
naturally i prefer to believe that everyone in this room is innocent but circumstances point to the conclusion that one of us may be guilty any one of us
confound it xavier
bring us up here on a night like this
why couldn t you have told us this at the academy
for a simple reason
i wish to conduct an investigation of my own alone quietly
and i want your help
this is a lot of tommyrot
don t you realize what the publicity of a police investigation would mean to us
you are quite right doctor
what do you propose to do
i want every one of you to submit to a psycho-neurological test an experiment that i have devised which i hope will prove each one of us innocent
but if it should prove otherwise
then my dear doctor surely one s own farewell to life is preferable to that demanded by the law
- this is preposterous
i refuse
- good then the police will give it to you
gentlemen i consider it a privilege to have an opportunity of proving my innocence
- doctor i m ready
- thank you dr rowitz
- dr wells
- yes
- professor duke
- i agree
- and you professor haines
- well if they all agree
- good
- oh i think it s a lot of nonsense
gentlemen i suggest you all retire to your rooms and unpack
in 10 minutes we shall all meet in the laboratory
a still
wonder where they bottle it
bad luck
you and me both
very well doctor
at once
your room is at the end of the corridor
mine s over there
i just fixed yours for the night
is there anything else miss
why mamie what s the matter with you
your teeth are chattering
this terrible house
it gives me the horrors worse than ever
well don t be absurd
go to bed and go to sleep
well i hope you get a good night s sleep
- good night
- good night mamie
good night
come mamie
come
come mamie
how would you like to meet a ghost in here eh mamie
well i ll tell you one thing
he d be a lot pleasanter than you
stop that otto
stop it
there ain t anything in this room to be afraid of
so you can just stop trying to make me nervous
well well mr zilch how are you
the smells don t they remind you of an embalming parlor eh mamie
the only thing in this room that does that right now is you
yes you can laugh now if you want to but you won t laugh tonight when you have to wear these for the experiment
- where did dr xavier get that
- from the morgue
the old scrubwoman wore these the night that she was murdered
look mamie look here
you can see some of the blood on them
- no otto
no please otto
no no - look mamie look mamie
yes - i take back what i said please - look mamie look
otto mamie what s wrong with the switchboard
what s going on here
- nothing sir
- yes there is doctor
- he s trying to scare me
- otto stop this foolishness
- yes sir
- now pay attention both of you
- you have the dress otto
- right here sir
mamie you ll kindly put it on
- put in on
but doctor - now i want your help
you and otto will enact the last murder of the so-called moon killer before an audience i ve selected
otto knows all about it and will instruct you in your part
- what part do i play
- the scrubwoman of course
- the one who was murdered last night
- murdered but doctor please please
couldn t otto play it
no otto has his own part that of the killer
there s nothing to be afraid of
remember our signals otto
just as i explained
yes sir
you see mamie there s nothing to be afraid of
there s nothing
how ve you been babe
now cut it out now will you
cut it out
you re right
how utterly absurd good heavens doctor what have you done with your laboratory here
it s nothing like it was at my last visit
- i ve made a few changes that s all
- a thousand i should say
thermal tubes huh
a blood reaction by high frequency current as well
dr xavier is still working on his theory that strong mental repressions phobias hidden in the darkest corners of the subconscious mind can be brought to the surface and made to register through certain reactions of the heart
- am i correct professor
- precisely
and tonight i hope to prove my theory
now gentlemen would you kindly be seated in these chairs
we ll begin the experiment
well if we must then let us get it over with quickly
dr rowitz dr haines and professor duke
and now gentlemen with your permission
dr wells will assist you in clamping these contact wires to your wrists
are yours included
certainly
as close as possible
but see that the connections aren t too tight
you ll be quite comfortable
pardon me a moment doctor as i attach the contact clamp
that s it thank you
did i have to come all the way down from the city to play guinea pig for you
i m sure you ll forgive me in just a few moments
- we re ready professor - the moon
perfect
- just as though we d ordered it
- close those curtains
give me the shivers
moon shining right in my face
- oh no no no leave them alone
- close them
- shall i
- all right you may close them wells
now listen please to what i have to say
one of us in this room may be a murderer
a murderer who killed by the light of a full moon leaving his victim s body mutilated
a cannibal
evidence shows the killer has two hands
therefore only wells is eliminated
so i shall ask him to work the apparatus
wells
wells how about me
a hopeless paralytic
silence please professor
wells will you take your place outside in the recording cabinet
yes doctor
i m going to leave you for a moment now while i check the variability of your blood reactions
i suggest that you remain silent during my absence
wells the young quack
had him for an intern before he could grow a beard
if you ask me i think dr xavier is using very unethical methods
necessity has no ethics sir
gentlemen i am now turning on the 100-milliampere high-frequency coil
your pulses are connected with the magnetic rotators and each variation of your heartbeat reaction is amplified 4 000 times
the rotor of the electrostatic machine is connected in multiple series with a bank of glass-plate condensers and the discharge causes irradiations to the thermal tubes which in turn indicate your increased pulse rate and nerve reactions
we can proceed now
one moment doctor
were the murdered women attacked
does your mind never run into any other channel
what do you mean by that statement
i mean that your sadistic tendencies may someday carry you too far dr haines
- you you
- silence gentlemen please
now it is my theory that one of us in the past through dire necessity was driven to cannibalism
the memory of that act was hammered like a nail into the mind of that man
shrewd and brilliant he could conceal his madness from the human eye
even from himself
but he can t conceal it from the eyes of the radio sensitivity
every time his heart beats from mental excitement the thermal tubes will betray him
you are all now connected with these tubes i am myself
but i alone know which tube is yours
your heart beats are being reflected before you
doctor i protest
as the heart beats faster and faster so does that red liquid begin to pulse and rise until terror takes hold of the subject and the liquid rises to the very top of the tube
he whose tube does that is the guilty man
here are a line of wax figures lifelike reproductions of the pitiful victims people whose lives were snuffed out and whose bodies were torn to satisfy the desires
first a woman of the streets killed in the tenement district
her body found late at night in a gutter
the next victim a middle-aged woman killed just before dawn as she was on her way to market
her bleeding body found under a dock by the waterfront
then a dope fiend strangled and mutilated in the doorway of a dance hall
next a beautiful young girl violently killed as she lay on a hospital bed recovering from an illness
oh i m so afraid
i m shaking like a leaf
keep quiet
get ready
watch
you re about to see reenacted the murder of the killer s latest victim
an old scrubwoman
she s coming home from work
it s late
a full moon shines down upon her
she s passing through an alleyway when suddenly a terrible figure steals out starts creeping towards her
as old annie stoops to pick up a newspaper the figure suddenly takes her throat in his powerful hands
get your hands off me otto you re hurting my throat
- turn on the lights
- someone s coming in the room
stop it stop it i can t stand any more
xavier turn on the lights
i can t get my breath
- the lights
- look at that tube
it s a success
the guilty man is
the guilty man is rowitz
rowitz
look what s happened to him
- he s been murdered
- let me see
what s the matter
what has happened
stabbed in the base of the brain
murdered like all the other moon killer victims
- who was sitting on his left side
- i was but i didn t see anything
i was watching the experiment
duke you re walking
i walked
you saw me
you saw me i walked
i walked
- you walked
you faker you killed him
- quiet haines
don t you recognize hysteria reaction when you see it
- otto help him
- take it easy doctor

wells

what s wrong man
i don t know
the lights went out
someone called my name
i started for the laboratory and someone struck me
oh this is terrible
easy now let me help you
i will be all right in just a moment
watch your head
are you sure you heard no one approaching the room when we started the test
no one
nothing unusual happened until i was struck
father something terrible has happened to dr rowitz
- i just saw him
- now joanne dear be calm
dr rowitz has met with an accident
- i wish you d go back to your room - he s dead
you can t do anything here joanne
it s best that you go back to your room
- your father will explain everything later - now come joanne
come
doctor doctor
- what is it haines
- there s someone hiding in this closet
what
another one
who is it
he s the young man who was at the house today
he fainted
- some water otto quickly
- yes sir
i took the liberty of having something on hand
- for just such an occasion sir
- thank you
here young man drink this
how s that huh
it s not bad
how much do you pay for it
he s all right now
what were you doing in that closet
- hiding
- who are you
lee taylor the daily world
you wouldn t give me a break so i had to take it
- you re lying
- don t be absurd
he is a newspaper man
he s the one who printed the story about you in yesterday s world
i m sorry
you see i had to get the story
i was hiding in there and everything was going great when all of a sudden well i guess i just fainted
it s gonna be kind of tough if i have to lug smelling salts around with me the rest of my life
yes well newspaper man or not you re an impostor
i don t like your methods
i shall hand you over to the police
- otto
- that suits me
i ll phone my story in from the police station
- you ll phone no story
- father let me talk to him will you
i can t let this story get out now
it d ruin everything
but father please let me talk to him mr taylor
just in case
- you re not gonna let him go
- certainly not otto watch him
don t let him get near a phone or leave this house
yes sir
oh no no i m absolutely all right now don t
don t you worry about me
i gotta dash off to my newspaper
- see they won t wait
- mr taylor
you don t have to report to the paper what you ve just seen do you
i m sorry but i ve got to
you see this is the most sensational case that s broken in six months
i know
but can t you wait
won t you give father a chance to find out who s doing it
what difference does it make to the public what happens or how he does it so long as he catches him
it makes a lot of difference
the public want to read about it
the more sensational it is the more the son-of-a-guns love it
is that all you think about
sensationalism
don t you ever think about people s feelings
can t you realize what a scandal would do to my father s institution
certainly i can but don t you realize that i m in a hard-boiled racket
then why don t you help us instead of making it so much more difficult for us
aren t we going through enough trouble
look at the trouble i ve been through to get this story
i lay down at the morgue with a bunch of stiffs
i looked at a lot of goofy guys
i let a dumb policeman
will you at least stay the rest of the night and talk it over with father in the morning
i tell you what i ll do
i ll hold off on this story and i ll stay if you let me have breakfast with the family in the morning
i think it can be arranged
father usually has breakfast at 7 30
- and you
- oh i am lazy i have mine at 9 00
oh you have no idea how lazy i am
- could i have mine at 9 00
- possibly
and will you take me for a swim afterwards
- a swim
- at the beach
if you re so helpless you can t find the water you ve no business in it
but i like the water and
i am sorry miss i had no intention of disturbing you
that s okay otto
- there s old man bad luck again
- i am sorry
that s all right otto
i m glad you re here
mr taylor s staying for the night
i d like you to prepare a room for him
i have already done so miss
may i suggest that you do not disturb your father any further tonight
- he is very tired
- that s a good idea otto

no thanks
good night
what will you do if i start to sink and yell for help
throw you an anvil good night
this way sir
- do you sleep very soundly sir

professor i
father will you please come to bed

hate friendship love i don t blame you
it s so banal
like those postcards you buy

- yes
- about i wish you were here
and two little doves billing and cooing
oh no really
i was just thinking of something
of what
- come on let s go in the water shall we
- oh no no no
oh water and i are not very good friends
no listen when was a little kid i was very very delicate see
- but very good looking
- yeah
yeah well i won a first prize in a beauty parade
- a baby parade at asbury park
- how sweet
but my mother was constantly dunking me in a tub of water and i would get soap in my hair and in my eyes and my thing
and water and i are not very good friends
so let s stay right here huh
why not
- there s somebody watching us
- where
look
oh this is a terrible place
i wish i were away from it
if you only knew the things that have happened
listen
forget that i m a newspaperman
i wouldn t betray your confidence
don t you see the only thing i m concerned about is your safety
are you worried about your father
yes i am terribly
i wouldn t be
he s very tired
he s working under a terrific strain
- he s bound to show it
- i know
but last night after everyone went to bed i saw my father bending over rowitz s body
i saw
oh it s a terrible thought
oh snap out of it
let s get dressed and we ll
oh we ll have breakfast
that s right
well i ll let you know your eyes
your eyes are so blue when i look into them
that s right mamie
you drink it and you ll go right to sleep
nothing s going to hurt you
she ll be all right as soon as this sedative has taken effect
but the doctor will be mad if i can t go through with it
no father knows you re sick
of course he won t be angry with you
don t you worry about the experiment
i m sure the doctor will make other arrangements
i can t do it i can t
something tells me if i go in that room tonight tomorrow i ll be in my coffin
now now you just be quiet and forget about everything
oh miss joan something horrible is gonna happen
i feel it in my bones
last night i dreamed i was walking up to a casket and when i looked inside it was me
here now now now
you ll be getting hysterical again
you ll be all right
just go to sleep
in the morning you ll feel fine
i think we d better leave her alone joanne
no miss joan please don t go
i don t wanna die
i m too young to die
i ve got too much to live for
no
- how s mamie
- she ll be all right
don t worry
- thank you dr wells
- it s quite all right
what s become of that newspaper fellow
have you seen him
not since dinner
he went directly to his room
i ve been looking for him everywhere
i have a feeling that he s sneaked out and phoned the story of rowitz s murder to the papers
publicity of that sort would ruin everything
i don t think he d do that
he gave you his word
i asked you not to let him out of your sight dear
- why don t we look in his room - oh will no one obey me anymore
bad luck
skull crossbones
death
hello
- oh yes
- did you find him dear
- no not yet dad
- he s right here sir
- for me
- the commissioner of police sir
thank you
- hello commissioner
- look here doctor
i ve decided to send an undercover man up there tonight when you start your tests
no there won t be any tests tonight
you ll have to give me another 24 hours
well the woman i was depending upon was taken sick this afternoon and it spoils all my plans
well i m sorry but if things have gotten beyond your control i m coming down there right away to take charge
i m in a tough spot
i ve got murder enough already to explain to the press and public
- and if you think for a moment
- one moment commissioner
the 48 hours aren t up yet
well i have to make some other arrangements
hold your men up just a little longer
give me one more chance please
all right
i ll give you until midnight
if you haven t got your man then i m coming down there and slap the whole place under arrest
yank you all up to headquarters whether you like it or not father i want to help you
you can t count on mamie
- let me take her place
- you
no i couldn t ask you to do that joan
but please dad
you get a squad car down to blackstone shoals at midnight sharp
yes sir
put the signal button on the control table and attach the wires to the thermal tubes
yes doctor
what s the meaning of all this paraphernalia
idiotic nonsense
these chairs are too far apart to protect us from each other
the contacts have all been checked
you ll be ready in just a moment
- thank you wells
- doctor i still think you re making a mistake using joanne in this experiment
after all gentlemen this is my daughter s own suggestion
i have no fear for her safety
she s a sensible girl and knows what she s doing
yeah and if she were my daughter she wouldn t be up there on a bed in nothing but a nightgown just to satisfy some lunatic s experiment
professor duke don t criticize joanne for her state of undress
this argument is irrelevant
doctor you forget that last night there was a murderer at large in this room
and the murderer is still here
i m convinced
but i ve taken precaution against that
you will each of you be handcuffed to your chairs and you ll notice that each chair is bolted to the floor
i refuse to submit
you ll have us in straightjackets next
i won t sit here handcuffed while you re running around loose
i intend to be handcuffed also
that will assure us there can t possibly be a repetition of last night s tragedy
oh wells
they re very becoming to you haines
it is time to get ready
aren t you afraid miss
there s only one thing i m afraid of otto
that s father s health
he s been working so hard and lately he seems so strange
the human mind will only stand so much
we are all a little strange up here
that s why i want father to get away from here
he needs a long rest
he s promised me that just as soon as this is over he ll go abroad with me
you are right miss
don t be afraid tonight
be sure you keep your eyes closed
and relax
is that all doctor
yes everything s set
now go to the electric cabinet and do exactly as i told you
throw on the current the moment you are ready
yes sir
doctor has it ever occurred to you that wells is free to do as he pleases
i ve guarded against that also
wells wishes to be treated the same as we are
- otto
- yes sir
bolt all the doors so that no one can get in
- the rest you know
- yes sir
here are the keys
synthetic flesh
synthetic flesh
and now you are about to witness one of the most gruesome crimes of the moon killer
the death of florence johnson
murdered and horribly mutilated as she was lying weak and helpless on a hospital bed

and now i found it
you i think i went to africa to study cannibalism
i went there to get samples of the human flesh that the natives eat
yes that s what i needed
living flesh from humans for my experiments
what difference did it make if a few people had to die
their flesh taught me how to manufacture arms legs faces that are human
i ll make a crippled world whole again
doctor your name will be remembered
you ve given your life everything to science
all but one thing and now you re gonna give even that to science
your daughter
oh if only i were not powerless here in chains

when you meet lady dogs on the street that are not dachshunds you must exercise some self-control
we have company
you re late
the dancer s gone to the theater
excuse me i m busy
this is a very peculiar thing for one gentleman to say to another but as a matter of fact you re the one thing in the world i really love
she s gone to the theater
don t you know
- what are you going to do
- the pearls are in her room
the others are getting suspicious
i had amsterdam on the phone
they think you re scared
i ve been careful
i m waiting my chance
waiting your chance
you re too much of a gentleman that s the trouble
i told you i d get those pearls tonight didn t i
- need any help
- no
have you got the skeleton key
- no
- why not
one reason there s a perfectly charming floor clerk outside who sees everything
she d see me enter her room
- i can take care of her
chloroform on a handkerchief while you re on the job
- no
- why not
poor kid
in the first place it would give her a rotten headache
i know all about chloroform
i had it in the war
besides she s rather pretty
- she has a very nice line
- you re no good for this business
- no
- to you it s just a joke
i don t like your tone
- no
- no
get out
leave her to me
be ready to leave on the night train for amsterdam
- with the pearls
- with the pearls
get out
there is a nasty man adolphus

both parties have fully agreed that this merger can only result
in mutual advantages
moreover
- did you get that
- yes i got it
what did you say zinnowitz called you
flaemmchen
- flaemm
that s odd

i mean who were the gentlemen you were talking to in the corridor
some people i know
- you know a lot of gentlemen don t you
- oh not many
i haven t time
i m busy now looking for a job
i d love to be in the movies
why the movies particularly
i mean
only in mutual advantages
moreover
you re a very unusual stenographer
you re pretty enough to do other things

- what
you see i have a rather nice figure and i pose a lot
art studies you know
like that
i got 10 marks for it
is that you
you
well isn t that interesting
- that s lovely
- moreover
moreover the possibility of the successful accommodation
for the cotton company
should throw a great weight into the balance
balance
your hands are sunburned aren t they
- yes that s from skiing
- from skiing
a friend of mine took me to switzerland last month
to switzerland
that must have been very nice
i went to florence once too
- with the same man

and what do you do now
now i m a gambler running at large like a happy pig devouring everything of life that pleases me
i really belong in jail
what a picture
and what else
what else
i m also a criminal and a hotel thief
that s not a funny joke
you must believe one thing
you must believe that i love you
that i ve never known love like this until now

and you said that s the young lady who was my secretary in manchester
that s all quite proper
but supposing i saw you and yelled
hi baby
remember manchester
and you were with your wife
how would you like that
we will leave my wife out of this flaemmchen please
- sorry
- i didn t mean that
you are very slender aren t you
- think so
- are you going to be nice to me
yes
- very nice
- that s what you expect isn t it
you like me just a little bit don t you
you re still a stranger to me but that doesn t matter
it s you baron
what are you doing in this room here
- this your room preysing
- yes this is my room
sorry
i must ve made a mistake
we shall see whether you made a mistake or not
that door is locked baron
yes
i came through here
here
i want that pocketbook
- what do you mean
- i want that pocketbook
give it to me
- certainly
- so that s how we stand baron
look here preysing i m completely at your mercy
i was desperate
it s a matter of life and death
i had to get some money tonight somehow
yes you did have to get some money tonight but you re going to jail
you re going to be locked up
- why you re a thief
- be quiet
quiet
yeah quiet
you danced with flaemmchen when i wanted to transact business with her
you the nice friend of the nice mr kringelein
- do you want to wake up the entire hotel
- i will wake up the hotel
i ll show them what a baron you are
you are a thief
i ll have you locked up
here you wait here
thief

strike me would you
hello
operator
operator
they re having a nice little game up there with that telephone
oh god

he s a thief
here miss flaemm
miss flaemm please don t leave me

- the baron
- the baron
go quickly
the baron
do you hear me
- where

mr kringelein he robbed me
he struck me
he s dead
baron
dead just like that
look
his eyes are still open
he looks so peaceful
it can t be so hard to die
that pocketbook he stole from me
it s just like it was
i haven t touched nothing
maybe he did try to take your pocketbook but you don t kill a man for that
you don t kill a man about a pocketbook
poor baron he wanted money so badly

that s it
she s working with that man
she enticed me into her room while he robbed me here

- to the court
yes
mr kringelein i must talk with you before the police come
miss flaemm is in your room
- yes
- she s in your room
no one will know that i was with her
you were with her
they will not interrogate you
they will not ask you any questions
you cannot give no testimony
neither can she say anything
but what you are proposing is falsification of the evidence
my existence is hanging by a thread
a scandal with that woman would mean ruin for me
- but you ve just killed a man
- that makes no difference
i beg your pardon it makes all the difference in the world
- we re going to call the police
- no

i will give you money anything

subtitles conformed by softitler
hey pipe down you mugs
sorry to break up the game boys but the old man s having bunk inspection in an hour
give me my bones
this man s army ain t been nothing but just one inspection after another
if ever i get back to texas on that range again the first man who says inspection to me he s going to be s o l because he ll hear from my six-shooter
there ll be no inspection where i m going
where s that
why back into vaudeville with my old lion-taming act
i wonder if oscar and minnie will know me when i step back into the cage
you better hope they do
i know what i m gonna do
get me some kind of construction job
i didn t know that was your line sergeant
it wasn t but it s going to be
being in the engineering corps has been swell experience and i m making the most of it
well we ll be reading about you in the newspapers i ll bet
mr james allen is building a new panama canal or something
you can bet your tin hat mr james allen won t be back in the old grind of a factory
do you think he ll be wearing his medal
why of course he will
- mom
- jim
it s good to have you back
you re a little thinner jim
your cooking will fix that up
clint
well you haven t changed a bit
but alice i wouldn t have known you
she s grown up hasn t she
she certainly has
and you look different too
i think it s the uniform i miss
it made you look taller and more distinguished
i got a regular welcome-home party here haven t i
mr parker it s nice of you to be here
you have a lot to thank mr parker for
that s nothing
he feels after all you ve been through we owe you something
mr parker is going to take you back into the factory
i ve saved your old job for you you ve done your bit and your boss isn t going to forget you
well i have- -
i m so glad to have you back
i guess we d better go home don t you think
all right i ll take this
i ll see you later jim
goodbye
the old place hasn t changed a bit
well let s sit down and have a talk
tell us all about the war
i won t live that long
what did you think of mr parker being at the station
say clint speaking of mr parker will you do something for me
sure
what is it
well will you talk to him for me and tell him i m not going to take that job
and why should i tell him that
it s kind of hard to explain
but you see the army changes a fellow
it kind of makes you think different
i don t want to spend the rest of my life answering a factory whistle instead of a bugle call or be cooped up in a shipping room all day
i want to do something worthwhile
jim how can you talk like that
he s tired mother excited
you don t know what you are saying
but tomorrow morning after a good night s sleep you ll be ready to take up where you left off at the factory
a soldier of peace instead of a soldier of war
i don t want to be a soldier of anything
you see mom
i want to get out
away from routine
i ve had enough of that in the army
you found another job
not exactly mom but you see i ve been doing engineering work in the army and that s the kind of work i want to do now
a man s job
where you can accomplish things
where you can build construct create do things
that sounds very nice
but after all a job in the hand is worth two in the bush
i don t want to tell you what to do jim but when you were in the war every time i passed the factory
we ve moved things around quite a bit
this is a lot nicer than the old shipping room isn t it
you ll sit by this window and check the shipments
the job s just about the same
before you know it you ll be doing it again with your eyes shut
they re excavating
i shouldn t think that would scare you
i was looking for the nearest dugout
you ll hear lots of those explosions
they re building a new bridge over there
better get busy and file those bills of lading yes sir
it might do some good if you had another talk with jim
i certainly intend to
parker s given him a job anyone in town would grab and what does he do
checks in day after day late from lunch
loitering around that new bridge for no reason at all
he ll come out of it but it worries me too
is that you jim
it s me mom
maybe you could speak to him now
- hello clint
- you re quite a stranger here
- had your supper
- no i m not hungry
- but you should have a bite of something
- i can t mom i don t feel like it
well anyway sit down
i want to talk to you
jim mr parker s very disappointed in you
you haven t shown him anything
you know your duty is to your job
i know it but i just can t help it
maybe you re not well dear
it isn t that mom
i m all right
i try my best when i get there but i just can t concentrate
it s not the kind of work i want to do
i said so when i came home
it s too monotonous
but you don t seem to realize- -
that s it realize
no one seems to realize that i have changed
i m different now
i ve been through hell
folks here are concerned with my uniform how i dance
i m out of step with everybody
all this while i was hoping to come home and start a new life to be free and again i find myself under orders
a drab routine cramped mechanical
even worse than the army
and you all of you trying your darnedest to map out my future to harness me and lead me around to do what you think is best for me
it doesn t occur to you that i ve grown that i ve learned life is more important than a medal on my chest or a stupid insignificant job
- appreciation
why you ve- -
- clint
what would you do son
where would you go
somewhere
anywhere mom just where i can do what i want to
if that s really in your heart i think you certainly should follow it
i knew you d understand
before we know it he ll be leaving us again that doesn t matter
he s got to be happy
he s got to find himself
you re a peach mom
i know where there s a lot of construction going on
up in new england
hey allen
allen

yeah knock off a minute
i want to see you
- well

put it in your pocket and come on
and don t start yelling for the cops
you don t have to yell mike
put them up
thought you d get away
i didn t do nothing - oh no
- no
i see no reason for leniency since the money was found on your person
furthermore upon detection you attempted to escape which would of necessity increase the seriousness of your offence
i therefore in accordance with the laws of this state sentence you to 10 years of hard labor

i m sorry too because i d like to rent this room to a gentleman like yourself
but you don t know anything about me
i can tell you look like you d be friendly
not like a stranger around the house
- how much would you be willing to pay
- really it s out of the question
well suppose i made it $ 20
that s silly
you can easily get your price for it
i m willing to let it go for $ 20 to you
well it s a mighty nice room
you ll like it
- hello honey - hello
- all you do every night is study
- i ll never get anywhere if i don t
anyway that s not so we were out last night
- i don t think you like me anymore
- of course i do
we can t always be playing around
anyway what s that got to do with it
i don t know but you don t act like you used to
- now i don t seem good enough for you
- you re imagining things
no i m not
when you were first here you weren t this way
you ve grown tired of me
i was silly enough to believe you when you said you loved me
i said i loved you
now marie you know that s not so
i never said that
you re just trying to put me in a spot
and you know it wasn t love just as well as i do
so that s the way you feel
you can t make me out cheap and get away with it
i know what i m talking about see
and someday you re gonna be sorry
come in
well so you really think you re leaving
i m moving to a bigger place i can afford it now
in other words that means we won t see each other anymore
no i guess we ll see each other sometime
you don t mean that
marie i appreciate all you ve done for me but i couldn t love you
i can t change my feeling towards you any more than i can change the color of my eyes
i know i m speaking bluntly but frankly this will save us both a lot of misery
and is that your only reason for leaving
- that s a pretty good one isn t it
- not very
of course when a fellow wants to ditch a girl he ll do most anything providing it doesn t land him back in the chain gang where he probably belongs here
it s from your brother
- you wouldn t
- i wouldn t tell if i had a reason to protect you
- i wouldn t tell if you were my husband - what do you mean
- well it means plenty of work
- i m used to that
yes
on the other hand all work and no play makes jack
how about knocking off and having a little recreation
we re giving a party tonight at the club chateau
how about joining us
- i d like to but- - - fine
and that includes mrs james
well i don t know
i m not sure that she can come - i ll ask her
- right
- anyway we ll expect you
- fine

- good night mr james
- good night
hello
hello yourself
is marie there
that s funny
where do you think she is
she had a date with me and she s giving me a stand-up and it s the first dame that ever gave me a stand-up
you can tell her that sammy called and you can tell her where she can go with little sammy s compliments
tell her that will you
and listen not a word to her husband understand
- don t you dance
- not if i can get out of it
that makes two of us
i don t care much for dancing in such a crowd
- i don t like crowds anywhere
- what do you like to do
build bridges roads for people to use when they want to get away from things
that sounds interesting
but they can t get away
nobody can
you re a strange person
don t pay any attention to what i say
you d like to get away from here right now wouldn t you
you don t like this party
i like it better now
well i was on the verge of sneaking home i m not so sure i want to now we might make a getaway
i don t think they d miss us
how about it
come on
well here we are
tell me some more about your work
it sounds fascinating
why talk about work
that s what interests you isn t it
no there are other things that interest me too
do you mind if we stay here a while or must you go home
there are no musts in my life
i m free white and 21
- you re lucky
- why
you can go where you want when you want
can t you
yes and no
you re a strange moody person
you need somebody to pull you out of those doldrums
are you applying for that job
- i might consider it
- you re hired
- when do i start
- you ve started several hours ago
don t you see marie
if you get a divorce i ll give you anything you want
i swear i will
what s the use of arguing
i told you i was satisfied with the way things are
- can t you see that neither of us is happy
- i m happy
i m taking no chances of letting you go
you re going to be a big shot some day with plenty of sugar and i m going to ride right along listen get that
i m no fool i d be a sucker to let you go now
but i m in love with another woman
that s just too bad
why don t you play the game square
square
so that you and your sweet mama can give me the grand go-by
be yourself
if you don t listen to reason i ll find some way
you do and you ll serve out your time
it s no worse than serving out my time with you
you ll be sorry you said that
now listen
you ve held a sword over my head about long enough
it s about time you called it quits
you ve been bluffing me and i ve been fool and coward enough to fall for it
you filthy good-for-nothing convict
a bluff
you ll see
- you ll see
- put that down
- give me the police station
- put that down
you don t think you ll stop me do you now that i ve made up my mind
we ll only take a minute of your time mr james
in view of your marvelous achievement on the new stevens bridge the chamber of commerce would like you as their principal speaker at their banquet
thank you very much
i feel highly complimented
there s two detectives coming through mr james
i told them you were busy but they wouldn t wait
i m sorry
i m afraid you ll have to excuse me
mr james or mr allen or whatever your name is
i have a warrant for your arrest
- and we can quote you literally
- certainly
everything i ve said are facts
i want this rotten chain-gang system exposed
print it all
how about a special signed story for our sunday supplement
sure i ll write it
gladly
how long were you on the chain gang before mr allen
governor baxter has not yet signed the extradition papers
until he does i cannot turn mr allen over to the custody of your state
in view of allen s record here since his escape our state has authorized us to assure you that if he ll return voluntarily and pay the state the expense it s been put to he ll be pardoned in 90 days
why is it necessary for my client to return at all
why mete out punishment to a man who has proven himself a useful and honorable citizen
merely a technicality
no prisoner is eligible for pardon until he s served 90 days
does that mean that i ll have to serve 90 days
- back on the chain gang
- no
you ll be given some clerical job in one of the camps
well it rests entirely with my client but i d advise him to stay right here
gentlemen there s someone else i d like to consult on the matter - if you don t mind
- certainly
they ve promised me a full pardon within 90 days if i go back
can you trust them
i don t see why not
i m giving myself up voluntarily
besides i want to get it all cleaned up now so that nothing will stand in the way of our happiness
i think it best darling
why they can t fail to pardon you
and then when you come back you ll be free for always
and we ll be together always
these stories you ve been hearing gentlemen are absurd
why our chain gangs are beneficial to the convicts not only physically but morally i can cite you- -
gentlemen i ve decided to go back
voluntarily
on your assurance of a pardon
and you won t regret your decision
i presume mr allen your chicago attorneys informed you that i would be in complete charge of your case down here
yes he did
let s get the financial end straightened out first
your capture and return cost the state $ 350
my fee will be $ 2 500
$ 1 000 now and $ 1 500 when you get your release
this is for the state
you know of course that you ll have to go to a prison camp for 90 days
- there s your check
- thanks allen
there s no reason to believe that after the 90 days i won t get my pardon then is there
this is a funny state and the governor s a little peculiar
you see all that publicity you gave out about the conditions here didn t help any
but i ll get my pardon
they ll give you the pardon
but that clerical job they promised you isn t so definite
they might want you to work for about 60 days
this is the guy that all that fuss was about
and if he tries to escape this time shoot him
escape
i m supposed to be a trustee here
haven t you had orders from the prison commission
sure i got orders that if you get away from here this time i lose my job
and that goes for all of you get me
- now take him out of here
- come on
go on
find yourself a bunk
go on down the line
how did you get to this little bit of heaven kid
it s a long story
sit down make yourself at home
if you can
boy if you think those other chain gangs are tough wait till you get a load of this joint
these are the guys that were too tough for the chain gangs
now give us the story
how d they snatch you back
they didn t
i came back
he just got lonesome
they promised me a pardon if i d come back for 90 days
what s a pardon
these boys up here ain t never heard that word
neither has the prison commission
what d you do to get sent up here bomber
i decided to hang it on the limb so i socked a guard with a sledge
i aimed at the rat s head but i missed
i can t figure a guy walking back into this just because they promised to spring him in 90 days
they just wanna make it tough on me i guess
but i ll get the pardon all right- -
listen kid they ain t thinking of handing out pardons when you land in here
this is the last word
you might say it s it
come on get to work down there
the case of james allen
- is mr ramsey present
- ready your honor
please be brief
we have a great many of these cases this afternoon
i should first like to introduce the convict s brother the rev robert allen
your honor
i shall leave the legal technicalities of the case to mr ramsey and shall present the story of james allen as a human being
a man of essential fineness and integrity of character
a man who was decorated for bravery in the world war
a man who committed a crime but only when forced to at the point of a gun
his first and only offence
a man who showed his true character by rising from less than nothing to become a prominent and honored citizen
and in conclusion i need not remind you that james allen has kept his part of the bargain
he has returned voluntarily to this state and has paid all the expenses demanded of him
i cannot believe in the light of all this evidence and in the name of justice that you will bring yourselves even to consider any other alternative
first i feel it is my duty to answer the malicious and unwarranted attack upon the chain-gang system which we have heard here this afternoon
crime must be punished
the men who commit crime are hard men and their punishments must be hard
but the brutality of which we hear is a gross exaggeration born of the fancy of the misinformed
the life of a convict in a chain gang is one of hard labor
the discipline is strict but there is no brutality
the purpose of prison is not only to punish crime but to discourage it
and there is less crime in this state in proportion to her population than in 40 other states in this union
finally as evidence of the chain gang s value as a character-builder i have but to present to you the very case that has been presented to us here today the case of james allen who entered the chain gang as a worthless tramp and who left it to become one of a great city s most worthy and respected citizens
the commission will take the case of james allen under consideration
five minutes allen
they refused to pardon you
they refused
the state s promise didn t mean anything
it was all lies
they just wanted to get me back so they can have their revenge
to keep me here nine more years
why their crimes are worse than mine
worse than anybody here
they re the ones that should be in chains not me
you don t have to stay here nine years
the commission voted that if you were a model prisoner for one year they would concede that you had paid your obligations in full
it s only nine months jim
nine months of this torture
i won t do it i won t do it i tell you
i ll get out of here
even if they kill me for it
it s still better to be honorably free
and in those nine months we ll be working for you night and day
but you ve been working night and day
it didn t do any good
but jim we ll have the whole country behind you then and the state will be forced to release you
all right
i ll wait nine more months
i ll be a model prisoner if it kills me
finally not only has james allen been a model prisoner patient and uncomplaining for a whole year but we have presented letters from countless organizations and prominent individuals beseeching you to recommend his pardon
i think it only just your honors that he be given his freedom while there is still time for him to regain his former position in society of prominence and universal respect
we ve just had a final report on your new hearing
well
they ve suspended decision indefinitely - which one did you say it was
- this one here
get up you lazy skunk
- driver
- what s on your mind
- you better come take a look back here
- i gotta get to the quarry
you ll never make the quarry in this truck
your spring s broken
spring s broken
- where
- there it is
thief
he s stealing my truck
stay where you are
keep driving boy
throw that box out
nix it s full of my favorite candy
we re making it jim
we ll make it yet
rip it boy go on
keep going kid
that s once i didn t miss
getting out here
helen
jim
- why haven t you come before
- i couldn t
- i was afraid to
- but you could have written
it s been almost a year since you escaped
but i haven t escaped
they re still after me
they ll always be after me
i ve had jobs but i can t keep them
something happens someone turns up
i hide in rooms all day and travel by night
no friends no rest no peace - oh jim
- keep moving that s all that s left for me
forgive me helen
i had to take a chance to see you tonight just to say goodbye
- it was all going to be so different
- it is different
they ve made it different
i ve got to go
i can t let you go like this
can t you tell me where you re going
will you write
do you need any money
but you must jim how do you live
i steal
english
the channel s here on the chart
so are the marking lights
then what s wrong with them
those lights don t seem to be in just the right place
they re both a bit out of position according to this
two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over
safe between the world over doesn t go in these waters
look here
you ll see the water shoals on the island side while the deep soundings run to the mainland
have any of you seen the captain today
- no
he wasn t down for dinner
- no and he wasn t down for lunch
he hasn t left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel
what are you driving at
ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters he s had the jitters
there s something wrong
i hey i m getting nervous myself
doc what do you recommend for nerves
- give him a shot of scotch
- give the whole bottle
- no i ve got nerves too
- here you are doc
just what you need
- well maybe you re right
- and how boy
- good evening captain
- good evening sir
- may i speak with you
- why certainly
go ahead
we re heading straight for the channel between branca island and the mainland
- good
- but the lights are just a bit off according to the chart
the charts are never up to date in this part of the pacific you know that
i know sir but
doesn t branca island mean anything to you
- well not a lot
- perhaps if i spoke with mr rainsford
bob s not a sailor
he s a hunter
he s made many of these trips
he s young but he has judgment
i ll call him
- oh bob bob
- what is it
- come up here will ya
- just a minute
what s bothering you captain
there are no more coral-reefed shark-infested waters in the whole world than these
boy just take a look at these
you didn t turn out so hot as a hunter doc but oh what a photographer
if we d had you to take pictures on the sumatran trip they might have believed my book
if you d had me on the sumatran trip you d have never had me on this one
say here s a swell one of the ship skipper what s the matter
these old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other and end up believing it all themselves
i think that mr rainsford should know that the channel lights aren t just in the position given on the charts
oh well what do you think fellas
i think we should turn back and take the outside course
we ll go ahead
very well sir
it s your ship
it was the schooner hesperus and she sailed the wintry sea
now wait a minute fellas
let s talk this over
- there s no use taking any chances
- chances
that s fine talk coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face
get an eyeful of this
and he talks about taking chances
here s the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera
get the expression on doc s face bill
he looks more frightened than the tiger
- he is
- what d you have on your mind doc
i ll tell you what i had on my mind
i was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization
the beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage
the man killing just for sport is called civilized
- hear hear
- it s a bit contradictory isn t it
now just a minute
what makes you think it isn t just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man
take that fellow right there for instance
there never was a time when he couldn t have gotten away
he didn t want to
he got interested in hunting me
he didn t hate me for stalking him any more than i hated him for trying to charge me
as a matter of fact we admired each other
perhaps but would you change places with the tiger
- well not now
here comes that bad-luck lady again
third time tonight
- here let me shuffle them
- wait a minute don t evade the issue
- yeah speak up
- i asked you a question
- you did
i forgot
- oh no you didn t
i asked you if there d be as much sport in the game if you were the tiger instead of the hunter
- come on
- what s your answer now bob
that s something i ll never have to decide
listen here you fellows
this world s divided into two kinds of people the hunter and the hunted
luckily i m a hunter
nothing can ever change that
hang on
hello
hello down there
hello engine room
- the panel is flooded
- if the water hits those hot boilers
help
help
you trying to drown me
where are the others
see anybody
nobody left but us two and that fella
doc
help
- look
- shark
ohh
it got me
hello
anybody around i say
oh hello
is this your house
i m not trying to break in but i ve been in a wreck
our yacht just sunk with all hands
i got ashore and found your place here by accident
i m not trying to intrude but i m in sort of a jam
don t you understand any english
ivan does not speak any language
he has the misfortune to be dumb
oh hello
are you the owner here
yes
welcome to my poor fortress
- fortress
- it once was
built by the portuguese centuries ago
i have had the ruins restored to make my home here
i am count zaroff
my name s robert rainsford
glad to meet you
very glad
ivan is a cossack
i am afraid like all my fellow countrymen he is a bit of a savage
smile ivan
i was trying to make him understand there d been a shipwreck in the channel
but how appalling
and you mean to say that you are the only survivor
yes i m afraid i am
you re certain
i d have never left the spot if i hadn t been
the swellest crowd on earth
my best friends
- it s incredible
- such things are always incredible
death is for others not for ourselves
that is how most of my other guests have felt
your other guests
you mean this has happened before
my fellow we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house
it would seem that this island were cursed
that s just what the captain said
only he thought it was uninhabited
we cossacks find our inspiration in solitude
- well it s a break for me anyway
- my house is yours
oh by the way
you ll want to change those wet rags immediately yes
they look about the way i feel
yes
i have some loose hunting clothes which i keep for my guests that you can possibly get into
ivan will show you to your room
- thank you
- you ll find a stiff drink there also thanks a lot
all pleasure is mine
come in
- ready rainsford
- all set
i m afraid we have finished dinner
but i have ordered something for you
thanks
i don t feel like eating though
oh well perhaps later
now then what do you say to coffee and most charming company
it is hard to forget your comrades fate i know but our feminine guest is easily perturbed
if i could beg you to put a good face upon the matter
a-assume a cheerfulness you may not feel
- why sure
of course
- thank you
miss trowbridge may i present mr robert rainsford
- miss eve trowbridge
- how do you do
- how do you do
- and her brother mr martin trowbridge
how are you old chap
pretty well shaken up i guess huh
- coming out of it now thanks
- we know how it feels don t we eve
indeed we do
perhaps mr rainsford would like some hot coffee
oh yes of course
mr rainsford please sit here
vodka that s the stuff
one shot ll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in java
have to toss it off though
like this
now martin you don t have to drink it all tonight do you
don t be ridiculous sis
we are victims of circumstance
same as mr rainsford
and if anyone has a right to his liquor it s a victim of circumstance
- isn t that so count
- of course yes
- you were in a shipwreck too
- yes
our lifeboat was the only one saved my brother and i and two sailors
the count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs
those channel lights must have been shifted
- i wonder it hasn t been reported
- well we ll report em just as soon as we get back to the mainland
you see the count has only one launch and that s under repair
russians are not the best mechanics
i m afraid we ll have to be patient a few days longer
it s all right with me
i feel as if i were living on borrowed time right now
speaking of that perhaps now you ll tell us a little bit about who you are
just sketchily you know
born married why i left my last job
no no no no
one moment please
mr rainsford need never explain who he is in my house
we entertain a celebrity miss trowbridge
wait a minute wait a minute
don t tell me
let me guess
i know
flagpole sitter
- i know
he wrote some books
- no he lived some books
if i am not mistaken this is mr robert rainsford who hunts big game so adventurously
yeah
here s to ya
- i ve lugged a gun around a little
- i ve lugged a gun around a little
no i have read your books
i read all books on hunting
- a papiroso
only in yours have i found a sane point of view
- what do you mean sane
- cigarette - hmm
yeah thanks
- you do not excuse what needs no excuse let me see
how did you put it
hunting is as much a game as stud poker only the limits are higher
- you have put our case perfectly
- then you re a hunter yourself
we are kindred spirits
it is my one passion
he sleeps all day and hunts all night
and what s more rainsford he ll have you doing the same thing
we ll have capital sport together i hope
don t encourage him
he s had our two sailors so busy chasing around the woods after flora and fauna that we haven t seen them for three days
but what do you hunt here
i ll tell you
you will be amused i know
i have done a rare thing
i have invented a new sensation
yeah and is he stingy with it
what is this sensation count
mr rainsford god made some men poets
some he made kings some beggars
me he made a hunter
my hand was made for the trigger my father told me
he was a very rich man with a quarter of a million acres in the crimea and an ardent sportsman
when i was only still up high he gave me my first gun
- good for him
- my life has been one glorious hunt
it would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals i have killed
- but when the revolution
- look out
oh i m so sorry
count zaroff was so interesting i didn t realize the danger
oh it s all right now
what were you saying about the revolution count
oh merely that i escaped with most of my fortune
naturally i continued to hunt all over the world
it was in africa that the cape buffalo gave me this
that must have been a close call
yes
it still bothers me sometimes
however in two months i was on my way to the amazon
i d heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning
no no no
no sport at all
well conditions are bad everywhere these days
one night as i lay in my tent with this this head of mine a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain
hunting was beginning to bore me
is that such a terrible thought count
it is my dear lady when hunting has been the whip for all other passions
when i lost my love of hunting i lost my love of life of love
well you seem to have stood it pretty well
i even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage
i made myself perfect in the use of the tartar war bow
tartar which
tartar war bow
that one up there
it s cute
even to this day i prefer to hunt with it but alas even that was too deadly
what i needed was not a new weapon but a new animal
- a new animal
- exactly so
you found one
yes
here on my island i hunt the most dangerous game
the most dangerous game
you mean tigers
tigers
no
the tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs
i heard some queer beast howling back there along the water
was that it
it s no use rainsford
he won t tell
he won t even let you see his trophy room till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit
my one secret
you let me in on that game and i ll bet you i go for it
you know rainsford he hasn t failed yet
if he says a thing is good it is good
he s a judge of liquor wizard at contract plays the piano anything you want
he s a good host and a good scholar eh count
yes yes
you want me to go hunting
you just say the word
we re pals
we ll have a big party get cockeyed and go hunting
a completely civilized point of view
i tell you what you do
you come to my place in the adirondacks see
we ll have a private car liquor and gals on the trip and the guides will make the deers behave
i think we d better change the subject
all right
change the subject
oh i know
play the piano huh
if you wish
good idea
play the piano
leave it to me and i ll fix everything
perhaps the count doesn t want to play
there you go sis throwing cold water
leave me alone
i know where the piano is
i m perfectly sober
charming simplicity
completely civilized did you say
he talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt
we barbarians know that it is after the chase and then only that man revels
it does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast
of course yes
you know the saying of the ugandi chieftains
hunt first the enemy then the woman
that s the savages idea everywhere
it is the natural instinct
what is woman
even such a woman as this until the blood is quickened by the kill
- oh i don t know
- oh i don t know
you americans
one passion builds upon another
kill
then love
when you have known that you will have known ecstasy
oh martin
here you see zaroff the keyboard king in his branca island hour
come on count
now you show them
- what do you suggest
- oh just a good tune
but not highbrow like last night
- just a good tune see
- i see
oh his hunting dogs
keep your voice low and listen
it isn t true about the launch needing repairs
i heard it leave the boathouse last night
it returned this morning
you mean he s keeping you from returning to the mainland
yes
well perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people
two maybe
there were four of us a week ago
- the other two have disappeared
- what do you mean
one night after dinner the count took one of our sailors down to see his trophy room at the foot of those stone steps
- that iron door
- yes
two nights later he took the other there
neither has been seen since
have you asked him about them
he says they ve gone hunting
oh be careful he s watching us
will you smile as if i d said something funny
you must be mistaken
not now
applaud
- attaboy attaboy
- thank you
what did i tell you
smacks a mean ivory eh rainsford
it was splendid
don t stop please
i m afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience
well i expect it s rather difficult for mr rainsford to concentrate on anything after all he s been through
my dear lady you are pleading for yourself
i can see the drooping of those lovely eyes
excuse me
you know the count s worse than a family governess
every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children
oh no my dear
no
charming children
there you hear that sis
now trot along upstairs and don t bother us grownups anymore
well after that i guess i guess i ll have to go
- good night mr rainsford
- good night
we ll be seeing each other at breakfast
- good night - good night
good night sis
we won t be seeing each other at breakfast
oh my dear rainsford i have been most inconsiderate
you must be feeling the need of sleep too
- yes i am just about all in
- then ivan will show you to your room
oh martin turn in early please
don t worry
the count ll take care of me all right
indeed i shall
- well good night
- good night sir
sleep well
oh uh well here s to long life
a long life
tell me mr trowbridge are you also fatigued
tired
me
you know i m not
you know rainsford we two are just alike
up all night and sleep all day
well good night
well what are we gonna do huh
what s the big idea
i thought that perhaps tonight you would like to see my trophy room
your trophy room
i m sure you will find it most interesting
say that s a great idea
ho-ho now we re pals
no more secrets now huh
- we ll make a night of it
- i hope so mr trowbridge
just you and i pals
we ll have fun together huh
precisely yes
fun together
attaboy county old boy old boy county
please let me come in
i m sorry to disturb you but i m frightened
those dogs
- my brother
i ve been listening for hours for him to come upstairs
i ve just gone to his room
he isn t there
- he s probably somewhere with the count
- that s just what i m afraid of
count zaroff is planning something about my brother and me
you don t really think anything has happened to your brother
oh i don t know but we ve got to find him
won t you help me
why of course i ll help you
- where do you think he s gone
- where did the others go
the iron door
i ll meet you downstairs in five minutes
thank you
that s queer
it s unlocked
zaroff
he s coming down
back here quick
where is my brother
where is my brother
you killed him
you killed my brother
you
come come my dear rainsford
i don t want to treat you like my other guests
you and i we are hunters
so that s your most dangerous game
yes
my dear fellow i intended to tell you last night but you know miss trowbridge
you hunted him like an animal
i know what you think but you are wrong
he was sober and fit for sport when i sent him out
an hour or two strapped up in here brought him to his senses
you raving maniac
yes yes yes i ll take it off when we ve finished
the stupid fellow tried to escape through the swamps of fog hollow
you see when i first began stocking my island many of my guests thought i was joking so i established this trophy room
i always bring them here before the hunt
an hour with my trophies and they usually do their best to keep away from me
where do you get these poor devils
providence provided my island with dangerous reefs
but there are light buoys to mark the safe channel
they do not always mark it
- you shifted them
- precisely right
too bad your yacht should have suffered but at least it brought us together
you take half-drowned men from ships you ve wrecked and drive them out to be hunted
i give them every consideration good food exercise everything to get them in splendid shape
- to be shot down in cold blood
- oh no no
oh i admit with this annoying fellow but usually i give them hunting clothes a woodsman s knife and a full day s start
i even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark
and if one eludes me only till sunrise he wins the game
suppose he refuses to be hunted
ivan is such an artist with these
invariably mr rainsford invariably they choose to hunt
and when they win
to date i have not lost
oh rainsford you ll find this game worth playing
when the next ship arrives we ll have gorgeous sport together
you murdering rat
i m a hunter not an assassin
come rainsford
say you will hunt with me
hunt men
say you will hunt with me
no
what do you think i am
one i fear who dare not follow his own convictions to their logical conclusion
i m afraid in this instance mr rainsford you may have to follow them
what do you mean
i shall not wait for the next ship
four o clock
the sun is just rising
come mr rainsford
let us not waste time
ivan
your fangs and claws mr rainsford
bob
bob
ivan
bob
bob what are they going to do
- i m going to be hunted
- oh no no miss trowbridge
outdoor chess
his brain against mine
his good craft against mine
- and the prize
- the prize
you may recall what i said last evening
only after the kill does man know the true ecstasy of love
suppose you lose
if i do not
what shall i say
find you between midnight and sunrise tomorrow freedom for both of you
- i m going with you
- no
he ll kill you too
not at all
one does not kill a female animal
if you lose i can easily recapture her alive
all right
i ll take her with me then
we ll set him a trail he ll remember
it s only fair to advise you against fog hollow
outdoor chess mr rainsford
don t lose your nerve
we ll beat this thing
- the others didn t
- we will
come on let s get going
it seems as though we ve come miles
yeah but three hours doesn t take you far in this jungle
come on let s keep going
come on
just a little more of this then easy downhill going
we ll soon be safe
no wonder he was so sure
this island is no bigger than a deer park
oh bob
come on now
what are we going to do
we didn t each live through a shipwreck to let this crazy man hunter worry us
i shouldn t have come with you
you might beat him if you were alone
alone
and leave you here with that savage
not a chance
now we ve got to think of something to worry him
you d never get near him
he d shoot on sight
weapons aren t everything in the jungle
say did you notice that leaning tree down there
- the one we just passed - yes
i want to show you something
you see
if that supporting branch were cut away this fallen tree would make a perfect malay deadfall
a malay deadfall
what s that
a man-killing contraption the natives use
it would stop that madman all right
trouble is it takes quite a few hours to build
he said he wouldn t follow till midnight
that s right
if you help me i think we ll have time
come on
we ll cut some strong vines
there
almost ready
this bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie
he ll have been on his way almost an hour now
look out
don t touch that trip line
you ll have a two-ton tree down on your back
- jungle wood s as heavy as iron
- will it really work
i ve never known a living thing to get by one yet
look here
you touch that trip line it ll pull that trigger free
once that s loose there s nothing to keep the log from coming down
it ll crash down and kill anything underneath it
look
we re ready
let him come
give me that knife
come out rainsford
why prolong it
i ll not bungle this shot
you ll never even feel it
but surely you don t think that anyone who has hunted leopards would follow you into that ambush
oh very well if you choose to play the leopard i shall hunt you like a leopard
wait
maybe it s a trick
eve
why did he go
he s playing with us
like a cat with a mouse
what do you mean
you heard him say he d hunt us as he d hunt a leopard
that means he s gone for his high-powered rifle
his rifle
oh bob we must get away from here
- run quick
- eve wait
- no i tell you no
- don t stop no
wait
that s fog hollow ahead
- the swamp where he caught the others
we haven t a chance of keeping ahead of him there
- but there s no place else to run
- that s just what he s counting on
we ve got two hours till dawn
we ve got to use our brains instead of our legs
but he ll have his rifle
and we ll have a man trap
it makes me dizzy
cover this over
when mr zaroff falls down there he ll be all through hunting
quick
gather some leaves and grass
i ll cut some branches
yes
very good rainsford
very good
you have not won yet
look at your watch
are you looking at it
still half an hour till sunrise
swamp or no swamp we can keep ahead of him that long
as you are doubtless saying the odds are against me
you have made my rifle useless in the fog
you cannot blame me if i overcome that obstacle
those animals i cornered now i know how they felt
achmed miss trowbridge bring her here
now
my dear rainsford i congratulate you
you have beaten me
not yet
oh but of course i insist
why you re
you re not even wounded
you hit the dog not me
i took a chance and went over with him
a clever trick rainsford
i cheerfully admit defeat
here s the key of the boathouse
the door is in the trophy room
you and miss trowbridge may leave at once
no
bob
eve
the boat
impossible
trying to teach me a lesson in patience sir joseph
method is everything in archeology my boy
we always deal with our finds of the day in order
well it seems to me that that box we dug up today with the very peculiar gentleman over there is the only find we ve made in the past two months that ll bring this expedition any medals from the british museum
we didn t come to dig in egypt for medals
much more is learned from studying bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds
our job is to increase the sum of human knowledge of the past not to satisfy our own curiosity
that s all very true sir joseph but after all we re human
and a find like this
well how can you wait
this is your first trip
i ve been out here 10 years and i m more curious about that mummy than you are and even more about that box
whemple
yes
the viscera were not removed
the usual scar made by the embalmer s knife is not there
i guessed as much muller
i had a good look at him when i photographed him
never saw a mummy like that
neither i imagine has anyone else
looks as though he died in some sensationally unpleasant manner
the contorted muscles show that he struggled in the bandages
buried alive
imhotep
high priest of the temple of the sun at karnak
poor old fellow
now what could you have done to make them treat you like that
an execution for treason i suppose
sacrilege more likely
look the sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld have been chipped off of the coffin
so imhotep was sentenced to death not only in this world but in the next
maybe he got too gay with the vestal virgins in the temple
possibly
the priestesses of the temple of karnak were the daughters of the reigning pharaohs
they were the sacred virgins of isis
maybe the answer s in that box we found buried with him
i see i shall get no more work out of you until after it s open
come on
let s have the box up there
the wood s so rotten it ll fall apart at a touch
whatever it is it s terribly heavy
metal
looks like copper
it s gold
i say
look here
the unbroken seals of the pharaoh amenophis
some temple treasure
death eternal punishment for anyone who opens this casket
in the name of amon-ra the king of the gods
good heavens
what a terrible curse well let s see what s inside
wait
you have read the curse
we recognize your mastery of the occult sciences muller but i can t permit your beliefs to interfere with my work
then why did you send for me this afternoon
as a friend and an expert
because i saw this find was unique and i wanted your opinion on it
it is providential that you did
come dr muller
surely a few thousand years in the earth would take the mumbo-jumbo off any old curse
i cannot speak before a boy
come out under the stars of egypt
do not touch that casket
go on with your cataloging
we ll open it later
you needn t think you can persuade me not to examine the most wonderful find of my whole experience out here
if you re right about the legend then this casket may contain the scroll of thoth from the holy of holies in the temple and i can hardly wait to get back to find out
the gods of egypt still live in these hills in their ruined temples
the ancient spells are weaker but some of them are still potent and i believe that you have in your hut the scroll of thoth itself which contains the great spell by which isis raised osiris from the dead
put it back
bury it where you found it
you have read the curse
you dare defy it
in the interest of science even if i believed in the curse i d go on with my work for the museum
come back with me and we ll examine this great find together
i cannot condone an act of sacrilege with my presence
what s the matter man
for heaven s sake what is it
he he went for a little walk
you should have seen his face
here s something to break the monotony
there s a visitor coming up the trail from the nile
color
nationality
how could i see in that glare
well whemple back we go to london
and what fools we look
money wasted hole after hole dug in this blasted desert
a few beads a few broken pots
a man needs more than hard work for this game
he needs flair
he needs luck like your father
in the days when he used to come out here there wasn t so much competition
when he did he found things
and once 10 years ago he found too much
was it 10 years ago
queer story that young oxford chap he had with him going mad
you know what i think it was
no
what
i think he went crazy bored beyond human endurance messing around in this sand and these rocks
he was laughing when your father found him he died laughing in a straitjacket
your father never explained
but when the best excavator england has turned out a man who loved egypt said he d never come back here that meant something
come in
you break your season s camp professor pearson
your colleagues have returned to london
yes
whemple and i stayed behind to clear up
your expedition has not been a success
scarcely
here are the season s finds
permit me to present you with the most sensational find since that of tutankhamen
this is very sporting of you
may i ask why we egyptians are not permitted to dig up our ancient dead
only foreign museums
well what s this
part of the funerary equipment of the princess anck-es-en-amon daughter of amenophis the magnificent
yes
it s her name
i found that not 100 yards from where we are
you mean you think her tomb is there
i will show you where to dig
i m sure it s very good of you mr
i didn t catch your name
ardeth bay
circumstantial evidence
not very strong perhaps but if we put that gang of diggers from kerna on the job we can tell in two days if there s anything here
in one day professor
it s a step
he was right
anyhow we found something
the name of anck-es-en-amon
we will cable your father in london
he must be here when we examine this great find
the seal of the seven jackals
and it s unbroken
no one has entered this door since the priests of the royal necropolis sealed it
3 700 years ago
is there a view like this in all the world helen
the real egypt
are we really in this dreadful modern cairo
your thoughts are far away from the dance and these nice english boys my dear
not really
i m having a lovely time
i m so grateful
but why
for your keeping me here with you of course
so i don t have to go up to father in that beastly hot sudan
it s i who am grateful my most interesting patient
know who that is
muller of vienna
really
always spends his winters here
authority on the egyptian occult
yes but the girl
helen grosvenor
her father s governor of the sudan
english of course
her mother egyptian
some old family with a tree a mile long
she s staying here with dr and mrs muller
pardon me sir
our closing bell has rung
i did not notice the time
i am addressing sir joseph whemple
yes
i am ardeth bay
indeed
why we have you to thank that we have this exhibit here at all
the museum should be kept open all night in your honor
won t you come down to my office
i m working here late
your pardon i dislike to be touched
an eastern prejudice
won t you sit down
you know my son
ardeth bay
where did you disappear to when we opened the tomb
i returned to cairo
but but now i must not detain you
but i must see you again
you you must come to my house
i regret i am too occupied to accept invitations
he s a strange one
but you might at least have thanked the man
he was responsible for finding the princess
yes
i rather wish he hadn t been
i think it s a dirty trick this cairo museum keeping everything we ve found
that was the contract
the british museum works for the cause of science not for loot
anck-es-en-amon
is anything the matter
anck-es-en-amon
where do you want to go miss
le musée des antiquités
imhotep
anck-es-en-amon
imhotep
i must get in
anck-es-en-amon i must
it s closed for the night
everybody s gone home
i must get in
imhotep imhotep
what s she saying
what language is that
the language of ancient egypt not heard on this earth for 2 000 years
and the name of a man unspoken since before the siege of troy
is your master at home
yes efendi
tell him dr muller wishes to see him urgently
how did i get here
we brought you here
father and i
you fainted
but how did you guess she was here
i discovered that she took a taxi from the hotel to the museum
i went there
the watchman said she had left in your car
before you take her away i must talk to you about something she said just now
oh dr muller
so here you are my dear
i suppose you introduced yourself
no
miss helen grosvenor my old friend sir joseph whemple frank whemple
this seems so formal under these peculiar circumstances
and now if you re all right again back we go to the hotel
i i think she ought to rest a few minutes
frank will you make yourself agreeable
well
where was i when i fainted mr whemple
oh outside the museum
what was i doing there
well i wouldn t know that would i
no i don t suppose you would
i wish i did
you see i was waiting
let s not talk about it
oh right
you re partly egyptian aren t you yes
how did you guess that
oh i don t know
just something about you
you know i d have liked egypt better if i d met you there but no such luck
stuck in the desert for two months and was it hot
that tomb
what tomb
surely you read about the princess
so you did that
yes
the 14 steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling
but when we came to handle all her clothes and her jewels and her toilet things
you know they buried everything with them that they used in life
well when we came to unwrap the girl herself
how could you do that
had to
science you know
well after we d worked among her things i felt as if i d known her
and when we got the wrappings off and i saw her face
you ll think me silly but i sort of fell in love with her
do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with
i say
now i know what it is about you
there was something about her head
i had never mentioned the name yet i heard miss grosvenor mutter in ancient egyptian something about imhotep
imhotep
what was this ardeth doing in the museum
looking at the mummy just at closing time
hello
what
come
a museum guard found dead in the room of the princess
so he died of shock
we find this in dead guard s hand sir joseph
probably thief try to steal it
guard take it away thief kill him
the cause of death i not find nothing
looks like an attempted theft but nothing stolen here could be disposed of
what is the document
let me put this here
you ll be more comfortable
thanks
you really want to know why i didn t take you to the hospital
because when i held you in my arms
hadn t you better not commit yourself
what girl could fail to make a conquest who collapsed at a man s feet in the moonlight
oh i know it seems absurd when we ve known each other such a short time but i m serious
don t you think i ve had enough excitement for one evening without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me
but i ve never been serious about this sort of thing before now look here
you can tell me to go to the devil but you can t laugh at me
the curse has struck her and now through her it will strike my son
quiet
frank will you come to your father s study
helen i shall take you home presently
i ll be back in a minute
imhotep was alive when that mummy in the museum was a vestal virgin in the temple
thirty-seven hundred years ago
what s that got to do with us now
your assistant who went insane and died as you might have done if you d seen what he saw made a transcription of part of that scroll
yes
i have it still
you seem to think this thing has all the devils of hell in it
why not burn it and be done with it
an excellent suggestion
what became of the mummy of imhotep
somebody stole it
look here dr muller what s the matter with miss grosvenor
you still think that that mummy was stolen sir joseph
yes i
oh i don t know
a thousand pardons
i am ardeth bay
i m helen grosvenor
i called to see sir joseph
he s in the study a conference
if i might perhaps wait
yes
of course
have we not met before miss grosvenor
no i don t think so
i don t think one would forget meeting you ardeth bay
then i am mistaken
but you are of our blood
as to that i am not mistaken
yes
my mother was egyptian
you must burn the scroll of thoth
i tell you it s the museum s property not mine
who s out there with miss grosvenor
ardeth bay
he s come for the scroll
ardeth bay dr muller
i accept your invitation but i find no solitary student with his books
i fear my visit is inopportune
on the contrary we were just talking about
me
your native egypt
you know miss grosvenor
ardeth bay introduced himself
won t you be seated
sir joseph was just wondering how you knew where the tomb of the princess anck-es-en-amon was hidden
partly inference partly chance
sir joseph you seem disturbed
yes
a tragedy at the museum after you left
tragedy
when i was there
when you were there miss grosvenor
yes
they told me i went there and tried to get in after it was closed
i don t remember but
helen it is very late
frank will you please see helen back to the hotel
certainly if miss grosvenor will let me
but i don t want to go
after what happened you need rest badly
but i don t
i was tired but i
why i ve never felt so alive before
then as your doctor i must order you to go
i m not a child
yes please come
then ardeth bay au revoir
but we must see each other again
i shall be honored
an unusual crime
a guard killed by a man who left a gift to the museum
a gift
a scroll
part of which was transcribed when it was first found
here is the transcription
i cannot read the writing of a period so remote
but you read the name of anck-es-en-amon on that piece of pottery
that was of the 18th dynasty
these are predynastic ideographs
the scroll from which this was copied was stolen 10 years ago together with the mummy of the high priest imhotep
most interesting
may i see that scroll sir joseph
we left it at the museum
so
i have something else to show you
a photograph
why do you show all this to me
do you think it conceivable that the mummy was not stolen but restored to a semblance of life by the spell from the scroll of
that scroll is my property
i bought it from a dealer
it is here in this house
i presume in that room
we had foreseen this
the scroll is in safe hands and will be destroyed the minute it is known that harm has come to us
you have studied our ancient arts and you know that you cannot harm me
you also know that you must return that scroll to me or die
now tell that weak fool to get that scroll wherever it is and hand it to his nubian servant
the nubian
the ancient blood
so you have made him your slave
if i could get my hands on you i d break your dried flesh to pieces
but your power is too strong
this is the evil force that has been attacking her
burn the scroll man
burn it
it was through you this horror came into existence
it s true it s true
your father destroyed the scroll knowing that it would cost him his life
what s that
isis the egyptian symbol of life
i meant it for your father
what good could that old charm have done him
i tell you the doctors say it s a plain case of heart failure
the nubian is missing
he s an old servant
he was frightened but he ll be back
don t try and make me believe that this ardeth fellow is a mummy come to life
it was that idea and the horror of it that killed my father
the museum guard died of natural causes too
frank i need your help
i saw your attraction to my patient last night and hers to you
hers to me
do you really think so
and i welcomed it
but do you think i have a chance
cause i think she s the most
but this is terrible at a time like this frank i m afraid
will you go with me to her now
yes
then telephone her first not to leave the hotel
9-5-9-0
no i m not going out
yes i promise to wait until you get here
goodbye
and i m so dreadfully sorry
what were you doing doctor
your father did not burn the scroll of thoth
that creature has it now but the ashes in the fireplace
they were newspaper
the scroll is papyrus
then it was murder
the nubian
wear this around your neck
why
when we fight this creature we must ask protection from the forces of old that it defied
i ll give it to helen
she s the one that needs protection no
her life is not in danger
it is her soul
should love for you come to her he will try to destroy you
that amulet the egyptians believe was a charm against evil sendings such as struck down your father
your dog is frightened
my servant will see to him
sit down miss grosvenor
ancient egypt
nothing modern
what a strange incense
is it not familiar to you
no
our forefathers used it
yours and mine
you will not remember what i show you now and yet i shall awaken memories of love and crime and death
i knelt by the bed of death
thy father s last farewell
i knew the scroll of thoth could bring thee back to life
i dared the gods anger and stole it
i stole back to thy tomb to bring thee back to life
i murmured the spell that raises the dead but they broke in upon me and found me doing an unholy thing
thy father condemned me to the nameless death
the scroll he ordered buried with me that no such sacrilege might disgrace egypt again
a nameless grave
the slaves were killed so that none should know
the soldiers who killed them were also slain so no friend could creep to the desert with funeral offerings for my condemned spirit
anck-es-en-amon
my love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods
no man ever suffered as i did for you
but the rest you may not know
not until you are about to pass through the great night of terror and triumph until you are ready to face moments of horror for an eternity of love
until i send back your spirit that has wandered through so many forms and so many ages
but before then bast must again send forth death
death to that boy for whom love is creeping into your heart
love that would keep you from myself
love that might bring sickness and even death to you
awake
have i been asleep
i had strange dreams
dreams of ancient egypt i think there was someone like you in them
my pool is sometimes troubled
one sees strange fantasies in the water but they pass like dreams
my dog wolfram
wolfram
where is he
helen
helen where have you been
we ve been so worried
we ve hunted everywhere
in the museum again
yes
muller s down in the arab quarter now well if i must give an explanation it was stuffy in here
i can t be shut up all the time
besides i don t like the feeling that i m always being watched
i took the dog with me
he s he s dead
but how
i don t know
where
i don t remember
but i can see it now standing on poor wolfram s back a white cat
a white cat the cat goddess bast
yes there was a statue of bast
the goddess of evil sendings
just what happened
try to remember helen
i don t want to remember
besides i don t see that it s any affair of yours oh but it is
we know that you were with ardeth bay
oh helen
helen i love you i m trying to help you and protect you
we all are
don t let me go again
i ll try to get away but you mustn t let me no matter what i do or what i say
there s death there for me and life for something else inside me that isn t me
but it s alive too and fighting for life
save me from it frank
save me oh everything s going to be all right
now that you ve asked for help i ll never leave you alone
i ll get mrs muller down here with you and i ll stay here till the doctor comes
and then we ll take you to my house
oh helen it s been such torture
i love you so
i don t like that doctor
please go in there and find out what he s saying about me
i will my dear he ll know just what s the matter with you and cure you
now don t worry
now miss sparling help me to get dressed and get out of here
it s come over you again miss grosvenor
i must escape
i m being held here
you must help me but you told me when these fits came on i wasn t to listen
i have a friend
he s rich
he ll give you money
now you just lie down again
you know you mustn t get up
well if you don t want money what do you want most he ll give you anything if only you ll help me to go to him
you want me to call dr muller
no
i hate him
i ll die if i don t get away from him
now miss grosvenor
it s killing me
do you hear please please now helen you must not do this again
you re always so exhausted afterwards
she s too weak to be removed except to a hospital
i insist on keeping her here under our direct observation
but dr lebarron you haven t told us what to do for her
she s getting weaker every day you know that negligee i bought in paris
help me to put it on and bring me my toilet things
i want some color
i want to look well
but you can t do that my dear
they d never allow it
the nurse would be
i know
we ll get rid of her
this is a plot just between us
i want to look the way i did
just a surprise for frank
and i want you to bring him to me
you understand in short i have failed to make a diagnosis
medical science is helpless in a case like this
frank
go to her and don t be angry with me
oh but helen you shouldn t have done this
they shouldn t have let you
just this once
perhaps the last time
but you re going to get well
then i know i can make you love me
i do love you frank
and i m trying to prove it because i d rather die than live and lose you
but you re going to live
we re not going to lose each other
so my dear
don t scold me
just feminine vanity
i wanted to look my best again so you know more than i realized you knew
what do you mean
these impulses to go to him
the pull is too strong to withstand and live
helen knows she knows the moment she stops struggling he will give her back her strength to come to him
but i don t want to lose my own mind and be someone else someone i hate
my dear while you were growing worse we tried to find him and failed
the next time the call comes go to him
muller what can we do now
we can do no more
ardeth has beaten me the next time he draws her to him we must follow her
and then
i ve given her some bromide
she s asleep now
i ll go to bed
all right
i ll wait here till dr muller comes
good night good night
where are we
this is my bed but this is not the temple nor my father s palace
do not look anck-es-en-amon
do not be afraid
i was afraid when you were kneeling beside my bed a veil came over my eyes
darkness your last memory is of me in the hour of your death as i knelt by your bed 3 700 years ago
no man has ever suffered for woman as you suffered for me
and now that the gods have forgiven us
no no not yet
your soul is in a mortal body renewed many times since we loved in thebes of old
but that love is not for us again until the great change
i do not understand
look
look and wonder
figure of myself
it is my coffin made by my father against my death
what mummy has usurped my eternal resting place
it is thy dead shell
i tried then to raise this body i could raise it now
but it would be a mere thing that moved at my will without a soul
it was not only this body that i loved
it was thy soul i destroy this lifeless thing
thou shalt take its place but for a few moments and then rise again even as i have risen
come
imhotep this is the place of embalmment
it is not lawful for me a priestess of isis to see or touch an unclean thing
come to the altar of anubis the guide of the dead
the time has come for the final prayers
the ancient rites must be performed over thy body
then i will read the great spell with which isis brought osiris back from the grave
and thou shalt rise again
no
no i m alive
i m young i won t die
i loved you once but now you belong with the dead
i am anck-es-en-amon but i i m somebody else too
i want to live even in this strange new world
for thy sake i was buried alive
i ask of thee only a moment of agony
only so can we be united
the bath of natron
you shall not plunge my body into that
let me go
let me go
don t kill me
i m a priestess of isis
save me from that mummy
it s dead save me
i no longer fear you
do with me what you will
frank
she s gone to him
now i know his horrible plan
he s going to kill her and make her a living mummy like himself
the gods will receive into the underworld the spirit of anck-es-en-amon
but not for long
osiris will release thy soul
you shall rest from life like the setting sun in the west
but you shall dawn anew in the east as the first rays of amon-ra dispel the shadows
look
come on
frank frank
helen
oh isis
holy maiden
i was thy consecrated vestal
i broke my vows
save me now teach me the ancient summons the holy spells i ve forgotten
i call upon thee as of old
helen
call her
he has dragged her back to ancient egypt
call her
her love for you may bridge the centuries helen helen

erik the ape-man
the monster who walks upright and speaks a language even as you and i
the ruler of the jungle whose giant hands can tear a man in half
erik the ape-man
the beast with a human soul
more cunning than a man and stronger than a lion
step up ladies and gentlemen step right in

and i am not the sideshow charlatan
so if you expect to witness the usual carnival hocus-pocus just go to the box office and get your money back

the darkness before the dawn of man

my home is in the african jungle where i lived with my father and my mother and my brothers and sisters
but i was captured by a band of hairless white apes
and carried away to a strange land
i m in the prime of my strength
and i am lonely
here is the story of man
in the slime of chaos there was the seed that rose and grew into the tree of life
life was motion
fins changed into wings
wings into ears
crawling reptiles grew legs
eons of ages passed
there came a time when a four-legged thing walked upright
behold the first man
heresy
heresy
heresy
do they still burn men for heresy
then burn me monsieur

do you think your little candle will outshine the flame of truth
do you think these boards and curtains are my whole life

my life is consecrated to a great experiment
i tell you i will prove your kinship with the ape
erik s blood shall be mixed with the blood of man
what does he mean

after the carnival last night i performed an autopsy
the victim didn t die of drowning
there was no water in her lungs
oh so that s what you were up to
i thought you were with camille
of what did the victim die
paul here it is again
what
the same foreign substance in the blood of each victim
look paul
all three died from the same cause
some strange poison perhaps
something introduced into the blood streams that caused their death
what could it be
i don t know
that s what i have to find out
oh pierre you must pull yourself together
why you re becoming fanatical
look at yourself in the mirror
your eyes are getting glassy
just like that old charlatan s
dr mirakle eh

they said a big black car gave them the works
hello ben

there s no law against manufacturing them just having them
if they can t get them in one state they get them in another
they better do something or what happened before will be a tea party
i know it
put the screws on the 22nd street freighthouse
i hear they re bringing them in in fruit boxes
- get that guy s number
- somebody get an ambulance
- what is this a pinch
- no just bringing you a valentine
- don t you know it s valentine s day
- oh yeah i forgot
come on line up you guys over there
all seven of you
- what s the gag
is the heat oh
- plenty
face the wall
put your mitts up
all of you
- here s gaffney
- what do you know about this
well
i was on my way here to keep an appointment
i was late
a car drives up and some guys pile out
two of them was cops
at least dressed like cops
cops
that s a new gag
then what
well it looked like a pinch so i beat it till it was over
lucky you were late
take a good peek and see what you missed
seven of them lined up against a wall
mowed down just like that
- didn t have a chance
- sit down
you ll wear out the carpet
yeah
i m the only one left
thinks he ll get me huh
fat chance
who s there
- mcarthur from the journal
let him in
- hi gaffney
- how d you find me
we boys from the journal always get around
- yeah anybody else know i m here
- no just my own little idea
sit down
you re gonna stay for a while
- well
- can t get a thing on him
a blind alley wherever we go
gaffney turned yellow and is hiding out
- what about lovo
- he s as scared as gaffney
it s camonte but we can t prove it yet
- we will
- say chief
this fella camonte
a story
the public s interested in him
- he s a colourful character
- colourful
what colour is a crawling louse
that s the attitude of too many morons in this country
they think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods
what do they do about a guy like camonte
sentimentalise
romance
make jokes about him
they had some excuse for glorifying our old western bad men
they met in the street high noon and waited to draw
these things shoot a guy in the back and run away
colourful
did you read what happened the other day
car chasing another down the street broad daylight
three kiddies on the sidewalk get lead poured in their bellies
when i think what goes on in the minds of these lice i wanna vomit
ben see if you can find gaffney
he ll probably get it next
they got all the others
our organisations are opposed to your policy mr garston
your paper could be an influence against gangsters
yet you keep on playing it up as front-page news
murders gang war killings
that s all we read about
you re glorifying the gangster by giving him this publicity
you re trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him by keeping him off the front page
that s ridiculous
you re playing right into his hands
run him out of the country
that ll keep him off the front page
in the meantime you expect our children to read of outrage and murder
that s better than their being slaughtered
the city is full of machine guns
gang war on the streets
kids aren t even safe to go to school
- you want that to go on
- certainly not
but what can private citizens do
even our police force can t stop it
don t blame the police
they can t stop machine guns from being run across the state lines
they can t enforce laws that don t exist
- it s up to the federal government
- you re the government
all of you
instead of trying to hide the facts pass laws that will do good
for instance
a law that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery
put teeth in the deportation act
these gangsters don t belong here
half of them aren t even citizens
that s true
they bring nothing but disgrace to my people
all right i ll tell you what to do
make laws and see they re obeyed if we have to have martial law to do it
the governor of new mexico declared it to stop a bullfight
the governor of oklahoma to regulate oil production
surely gang rule and law defiance are more of a menace to the nation than the regulation of oil or a bullfight
the army will help
so will the american legion
they offered their services over two years ago and nobody ever called on them
let s get wise to ourselves
we re fighting organised murder
that sadie thompson she s a pretty smart girl
why does a girl hustle in a place like that
yeah it s raining all the time
that rain that s pretty good
that comes from a pipe just like a shower

but anyhow when the king tells the marquis that he saw me the marquis will tell the marquise and the marquise is the best friend of the duchess of chambro
and she will telephone the princess de costa
the princess doesn t like me
- but i don t care
- why should you

in fact you tickled me
but your embrace was so sweet
- countess

well i am sure madame colet if your husband were alive the first thing he would do in times like these cut salaries
unfortunately monsieur giron business bores me to distraction

good-bye

but with you françois i think it would be a mistake
don t be so downhearted major
you re not the only one i don t love
i don t love françois either
madame will be ready in two minutes
i know you don t like me major
to be perfectly frank i dislike you intensely
but since we have to be in each other s company this evening we might just as well make conversation
well major what s your answer
for heaven s sake man say something
tonsils
# he s late # good-bye
you should be ashamed of yourselves
two men of your standing always quarreling
well he started it
but you re the more intelligent one
- that s true
- then why did you do it
because i hate him
because i love you
you should have more self-control
- you were in the army - well he was in the navy
good-bye
i want you to go out and apologize immediately
see here my good man
you ve been saying good-bye for the last half hour and staying on
i wish you d say how do you do and go

- now see here my good man i ve had just about enough of your insulting remarks

i thought martini s singing was adequate but to call him a great singer ridiculous
- remember when we saw him a year ago in munich
- a year ago
- it can t be that long
- yes
don t you remember the day you took that chinese vase from the royal palace
and you made it into a lamp for my night table
i remember the lamp i remember the night table and i remember the night
everything will be all right again
prosperity is just around the corner
gaston
read this
the description fits
that s our bag
twenty thousand francs
if i sold it i would get well it s worth 40 000 at the most
she paid probably 60 000
if i sold it i would get 5 000
well darling then i d be honest about it and return it to the lady
- and take the 20 000 francs
- right
sweetheart what day is today

- and tomorrow is the 15th

we ll go to venice to the same hotel
and we ll take the royal suite
- two fifty-three five
- seven and nine
no i m sorry but that s not the bag
next please
hello
yes
no no no it was not insured
but right now it s too late
i may lose it again
but i haven t found it yet
no no i m sorry
good-bye
- yes
- so you lost a handbag madame
- yes
- and it had diamonds in the back
- yes
- and diamonds in the front
- yes
- diamonds all over
- well have you found it
- no but let me tell you
any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag
- phooey phooey and phooey
phooey phooey and phooey
his phooey is worse than his bite
oh i must apologize for entering unannounced but if i am not mistaken madame colet
yes
will you be good enough to look at this bag madame why yes
yes that s it
jacques
yes madame
dismiss all the people in the hall
say the bag s been found
very well madame
where did you
where did you find it
- you know the main staircase in the opera
- yes - then you go to the left there is a landing
- yes
- then you go into the foyer
- yes
- and as you leave the foyer there is a little niche
- i know that niche
- and in that niche there is a statue of venus
- i remember
- you like that statue
- not particularly
neither do i that s where i found it
i don t know how i could have lost it there
i was nowhere near that niche
oh that s strange
maybe
are you sure this is your bag
but of course it is
are you doubting me
not in the least madame
but you see this is a very expensive bag and one has to be careful
well i am madame colet
and i am monsieur la valle if you ll allow me to introduce myself
how do you do monsieur la valle
the pleasure is mine madame
one purse empty one vanity case
but really monsieur this isn t necessary
please madame i believe in doing things correctly
shall we continue
two hairpins one cigarette lighter one box of real matches oh yes and this letter from major
- you didn t read it
- naturally i did
- oh
- you needn t be embarrassed madame
a lady as charming as you would and should get love letters
monsieur la valle
but one suggestion not the major
i don t mind his grammatical mistakes i will overlook his bad punctuation but the letter has no mystery no bouquet
and one lipstick
scarlet number four
what s wrong now
with your skin i prefer crimson
- too much blue in crimson
- but that s what you need
oh no no no no no no
i disagree with you completely
i tried it once
- what shade of powder do you use
- peaches and cream
- that s too dark
- but do you realize that i have light eyes
but madame colet that is a question of eye shading
i can straighten that out in two seconds
come in
the major
i m sorry monsieur but madame had better not see anyone
the bag has just been found and the reaction of relief from her excitement and strain
- is just a little too much for her
- but
it s nothing very serious but all the same we d better not take any chances
- just as you say doctor
- thank you major
- good day doctor - good day major
- oh jacques has the bag been found
- yes major
- is madame feeling well
- no major
is madame seeing anybody this afternoon this evening or even tomorrow
- no major
- you may shut the door jacques
well that leaves you holding the bag
good-bye
i think i d better be going
good-bye madame colet
good-bye monsieur la valle
oh yes
well this is a rather delicate matter and i i don t want to uh
you see if you if you read my advertisement carefully you you would have noticed
in other words it embarrasses you to offer me the 20 000-francs reward
- yes
- don t be embarrassed
i ll take it
i need the money
i wish i were in a position to ignore the whole matter but you know madame the stock market a bank crash to make a long story short a member of the nouveau poor
then i m glad i lost the bag
i ll write you the check immediately
- madame colet
- yes monsieur la valle
- do you know my first name - no what is it
tell me
gaston
- and you know what i would like you to do with that check
- what
make it out to cash
as you like
now where can that checkbook be
dear me dear me
she must have left it somewhere
it s always the same
when you re looking for something you can t find it
i can t find that checkbook
i should have discharged her six months ago
i really don t know what to do
monsieur la valle i m very sorry but
- eighteenth century
- yes early eighteenth century
i should say about 1730
right
- beautiful specimen
- it is beautiful isn t it
but i got tired sleeping in antiques
- so i gave it to my secretary
- oh
this used to be my secretary s room
i see
she must ve been very happy here
too happy
that s why i discharged her
oh that s terrible
isn t that wonderful
you see
let me tell you something madame as a man who s had all kinds of secretaries
i wonder if she put that checkbook in the safe
why i hardly think so but let s look
no
no it isn t here
well what do you think of that
a hundred thousand francs
you know i hadn t the slightest idea
but madame you keep 100 000 francs in your safe at home
- you think that s too much
- no
not enough
in times like these when everything is uncertain every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm s reach
mm-hmm
that sounds sensible
mm-hmm
yes very sensible
- very very clever
- madame
i think you deserve a good scolding
first you lose your bag
- then i mislay my checkbook
- then you use the wrong lipstick
- and how i handle my money
- it s disgraceful
tell me monsieur la valle what else is wrong
everything
madame colet if i were your father which fortunately i am not and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs i would give you a good spanking in a business way of course
what would you do if you were my secretary
the same thing
you re hired
speaking for the board of directors as well as for myself if you insist in times like these on cutting the fees of the board of directors then we resign
speaking for madame colet as well as for myself resign
very well
we ll uh think it over monsieur la valle
now monsieur la valle as for madame colet s life insurance it totals one million francs
there s 500 000 fire insurance and 400 000 against burglary
then we d better increase the burglary insurance to 850 000 francs
thank you monsieur la valle
- no potatoes monsieur la valle
- no potatoes
yes monsieur la valle
yes monsieur la valle
no monsieur la valle
oh maybe monsieur la valle
is this what you mean monsieur la valle
absolutely madame colet
now monsieur la valle please
frankly madame i m too tired
don t you want to come down and join the party
just a little tango
no oh you and your messy old papers and contracts and money money money
all those uninteresting things
they re very interesting to me madame
and somebody in this house should worry about money
no really i have to be up early in the morning
new paragraph
furthermore it is madame s wish that while half of the interest shall be deposited as usual in madame s account the other half contrary to custom shall be delivered in cash into madame s personal custody
darling that means that on the second ofjune we shall have 850 000 francs
- and her jewelry is worth a fortune
- no jewelry
hands off jewelry
if we re broke all right
i can pick up a million-franc necklace
but in times like these when we re doing a cash business why take a chance with jewelry
gaston i know you re awfully busy and well i don t wanna trouble you but she has one little necklace
you know the one with the seed pearls
it s so quiet and simple
- it d go just beautifully with my neck
- hmm
come in

well uh yes and no
to me he seems rather nervous
nervous
uh-huh he smokes too much
no no he works too much
he s chained to his desk
too much detail
now uh if you could take over some of his work
so he wouldn t be so confined to his office
yes and he d have a little more time for

i worship you as a crook
steal swindle rob
oh but don t become one of those useless good-for-nothing gigolos

good-bye sweetheart
well i ll leave you alone with that lady but if you behave like a gentleman i ll break your neck
come in
oh monsieur la valle
- yes madame
- has mademoiselle vautier gone
- yes

monsieur la valle

i was a school friend of your husband s
i know
madame may i ask you who is this monsieur la valle
where does he come from

i m like that
l-i can t help it
i know i never met that man and yet
- la valle

madame colet would like to see you in the living room

madame
will you be good enough to go over these papers with monsieur giron
i shall be delighted
and so will monsieur giron
well
monsieur la valle there are several questions i ve been wanting to ask you for quite a while

in that case you must be related to the la valles of marseilles
just a minute please
i hope you ll find those figures correct

- monsieur la valle
i have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more for more than 40 years
so madame told me

monsieur la valle you seem to be persistently evading my questions
and you monsieur giron seem to be persistently disturbing my examination of your report
examination

how long have you enjoyed the confidence of madame
three weeks i believe
- two weeks and three days
- ha
ha are you insinuating anything monsieur giron
- no no not at all
- well that s fine
then you re not insinuating that i m evading your questions and i m not insinuating that you won t let me examine your report
i was only asking if you were related to the la valles of marseilles
and i was only asking you to let me examine your report without interruption
i don t see why any man should get excited because he s asked about his hometown
and i don t see any reason for any man to get nervous because someone checks over the figures of his report
monsieur la valle are you insinuating this is not an honest report
i am only insinuating that you are nervous
- nervous why should i be nervous
- i don t know monsieur giron
are you trying to say there is anything in these figures to make me nervous
no not at all

detective lieutenant sheehan homicide squad
who s in charge here
i ve been trying to get things straightened out for you
my name is steiner
studio manager
what happened
well the company was shooting the scene during which several people fired guns at brent
and someone used real bullets huh
people do get hurt that way
that s the director s guess
oh the director
did he happen to guess who did it
no
that s unfortunate
looks like we ll have to do some guessing on our own come on hill loosen up
did someone really bump him off
i tell you i don t know
then let us in on the lot so we can find out
i can t let anyone on the lot
marcia lane was with him in the picture wasn t she
sure she was doing the lead opposite him
marcia oh his ex-wife
that helps the story
what s the name of the picture
the death kiss
the death kiss
gee what a tie up
stage office on the phone
just a minute boys i ll be right with you
eight men with guns yes
well it might have been an accident but
frank you don t think it was murder
darling i don t even know * * * maybe he died of old age
maybe he never even existed at all
now you wait here
i m gonna have a look around
yours
you break it
nothing but blanks left in these guns
any other guns on the set
that s all i know of
you see captain it s strictly an accident
lieutenant sheehan
what s your name
leon a grossmith
i m the president of this concern
well what about it
now look here sargeant
do you realize what this has cost me already
you have no idea
it cost me up to now $ 239 351
yeah and it cost brent his life
which also loses me money
i can t have no more brent in my picture
pardon me lieutenant
mr grossmith means to convey that this regrettable accident need not be converted into a roman holiday for the rabble
i assure you that mr grossmith feels deeply very deeply the tragedy of this affair
and his point is naturally not to throw consternation into that great and unseen army of mr brent s admirers
now that is precisely what mr grossmith means
that s just what i was going to say
mr steiner mr steiner
pardon me
what is it
the peckers are on my neck
i ve got to tell them something
there s no use stalling any longer
and they ve got a story now about a mysterious woman
they don t know themselves but they say it makes a great story
tell them it was an accident
they won t believe it
then make them
you don t know those boys
they ve got imagination
i don t care if they got fallen arches
tell them the brent shooting was an unfortunate accident
yes
is that satisfactory to you lieutenant
nothing is satisfactory
here s all he had on him
keep that
well i m sorry to gum up the works
but it wasn t an accident
it s murder
murder oy
what a calamity
how do you know
this is the bullet that killed him
a 38 calibre center fire
all the guns the extras used were 45s
and you can t fire a 38 bullet through a 45 gun
it s an old chinese principle
where did you get this
out of the wall of the set
don t you know better than to meddle in police matters
oh i m sorry
i didn t mean to meddle
i just wanted to help
you see i like to dabble a bit in murder cases
well you just go and dabble some place else
all right
who is he
one of our scenario writers franklyn drew
oh writes detective stories i suppose
yes
how did you know
they always do
well this makes a difference
looks like we ve got a murder on our hands
you go and get that assistant director
that brilliant young man who said there were no other guns on this set
right
who is marcia lane
what
you don t know who is marcia lane
over a million dollars we spend advertising her all over the nation
she was on set just a minute ago
let s have a talk with her
howell ask miss lane to come here yes sir
steiner and the detective want to see miss lane immediately
well hurry
i m fluttering sweetheart
bill
tell miss lane steiner and the dick wanna see her
okay chief
oh pete
rush miss lane over to mr steiner and the dick
now
no next tuesday you sap oh
come on get going
oh all right
pardon me miss lane
mr steiner and the dick wanna see you
thank you
you re welcome
what can they want with me
they just want to annoy you with a lot of routine questions
they always question people like you first to give the guilty ones plenty of time to make up good alibis
it s part of the system
been going on for years
sit down miss lane
thank you
i don t wish to be unpleasant but there are a few questions i d like to ask you
certainly
how long have you and brent been separated
we were divorced last may
why well i don t quite see
divorce is a matter of record lieutenant
i don t think we have to go into that now
say will you go up to your office and write bad little boy 500 times
when did you last quarrel with myles brent
i don t remember
didn t you love him
i wouldn t answer that marcia
say just what is your interest in this case
personally i don t care who killed brent
but i would like to know how it was done
besides that i m
i m a friend of miss lane s
wasn t your name mentioned during the divorce proceedings
no
sorry to disappoint you
what did you do with your gun miss lane
my gun
yes
i didn t have a gun
didn t you use one in the picture
no but when you fired with the other
as a matter of fact if miss lane had fired she couldn t have hit him
she was around on the other side of the set when the shooting took place
if you don t lay off i m gonna take you downtown
what for
how do i know what for
good i was beginning to be afraid you might say something sensible
hey
what are you trying to do there huh
don t move now
i got you surrounded
don t lie now
what did you try to hide there huh
why nothing
we ll see about that
hold this
hey wait a minute wait a minute
no you don t
yeah
oh yeah
this letter all ready to mail was found in myles brent s pocket
in this letter he told his lawyer that marcia lane refused to sign a release as beneficiary of his life insurance policy
so you stand to collect $ 200 000
miss lane s lawyer wouldn t let her sign the release
i know all about that
it s too bad you weren t the one that was shot
so that gives you a pretty nice motive
no funny business now come on keep moving
here s your man chief
i caught him red-handed
he was trying to ditch this gun
look
look
it s loaded too i tell you i
save your breath
put the braces on him owen
now ain t that astounding
something told me to take a squint around
i sees im trying to ditch his gun see
and i puts two and two together i says to my
i says to myself that s the man
i guess i used uncanny skill
38 caliber and loaded
it s the gun all right
who is this fellow
name s chalmers
he was an extra on the set
why did you kill brent
i never killed nobody
you can t alibi yourself out of this
that s the only 38 gun on the place
you killed him
why
i tell you i didn t
you gotta listen to me
shut up
you ll have plenty of time to talk later on
do you know this man
why yes
everyone on the lot knows him
he was head electrician for years
how much did you pay him to kill brent
now wait a minute lieutenant
why not pin the murder on the murderer
that s not against the rules
what are you talking about
chalmers didn t kill brent
how do you know
his gun hasn t been fired
how did this gun come to be loaded
i loaded it for brent
i lost my nerve
so you had planned to kill brent huh
yes i wanted to kill him
i had every reason in the world to kill him
but he made no attempt
so you can t arrest him
not unless you want to make a fool of yourself
you know i m beginning to think you re giving us the rash
prove it
you re a detective
take them off gulliver
and maybe we ll put them on him
well we seem to be right back where we started
yes perhaps you may have some very valuable suggestion
yes i have
what
the cameras were photographing when brent was killed
there might be something interesting on the film it wouldn t hurt to look
not bad
how soon can we see the stuff
we could get a print in say three or four hours
can we get them going
certainly
come mr grossmith
you take the name and address of every person on this set
and warn them all about trying to leave town
right
in any of your books does the detective ever sock the novelist on the nose
no
write it in sometime
seems to me like a good idea
marcia
oh frank
it won t be very pleasant to see it all over again
but it may help us a lot if we look carefully
is everybody here
i think so mr grossmith
mr steiner is in the projection booth
he ll be right in
all right
there he is now
are you ready mr grossmith
yes
mr grossmith s ready
quiet please
quiet
all right turn it over
rolling
mark it
action
can i get your car sir it ll be right here
thanks handsome
i just couldn t pass you up
believe it or not i ve never seen her in my life before
i must have been overlooking something
bloody shame sir
most annoying
right under my very nose
your nose i ll get the car sir
lights
turn on those lights
not hurt badly but he must have received a sharp blow
yeah it looks like it was done with a blunt instrument
you know i had an uncle once who was knocked out the same way
only he got hit with a shovel
whoever rocked your cradle overdid it
a rouge smeered cigarette butt started it off
can you tell me if that s studio makeup
hard to say
perhaps we should call the makeup man to tell you
thanks
how did it happen
i swear i don t know
i was leaning over the machine checking the focus i thought the building came down on me
how about another print
yeah but we ll take care of it this time
there was something on
and whoever cut it off didn t want it to be seen
if we have the laboratory man provide a new one right away
could you mr glossmith
why yes there s no reason why we couldn t
will you come with me
no hillicker will go with you
i have another angle
where do i find this makeup man
makeup department
clear out in the other end of the lot just at the end of f street
sounds like a sleeper jump
i ll show you if you like thanks
it s a special panchromatic rouge of my own make
only two people on the lot are in the habit of using it
who are they
miss collins and miss lane
who s miss collins
she s one of our players
is she in this picture you re photographing
no i believe she s working in the night riders and they re out on location
and the only other person on the lot that uses this rouge is marcia lane
as far as i know
i see
thanks
you re welcome
wait a minute
you have quite a stock of this rouge on hand haven t you
a few tubes of it
just as i thought
anybody could get at it
not very well
all the makeup that is not in use is kept in the cabinets
and the cabinets are locked
yes
it s hidden
hello
just a minute
it s for you
hello
yes hillicker
how
all right
you stick around there and see what you can find out
tell steiner i ll see him at his office
the negative of that last scene has been ruined
someone poured acid in the container
this thing gets more muddled every minute
you re telling me
how do i get to steiner s office
i ll show you thanks
and you re not going with me
right at the end of the street
right
you ought to have a map of this place
oh lieutenant
you know that anybody could have taken the rouge from miss lane s dressing room
sure
a very interesting detail
what do you make of it drew
got me
it s more of a mystery than anything i ever wrote
what i can t undertsand is why anyone should want to murder brent
not if it were a supervisor
i don t see why anybody wants to murder anybody
it s a silly idea
you re going to try and solve it
yes why not
it would be fun
besides
marcia
yes
oh say tom
if you see her don t say anything about that director
it would only upset her
no no no of course not
if i can help you let me know
thanks
has anything been moved on the set
no police instructions were to leave everything undisturbed
well i m gonna have another look around
i want to find out just how he was murdered
and with what gun
i got an idea how brent was killed
you wanna hear it
some other time
better go home and sleep it off chalmers
that s what you think
chalmers don t know anything huh
but listen
i ve been on the set and i ve been seeing things
yeah snakes and pink elephants i ll bet
yeah all right be smart be smart
now listen you re gonna come to me later
i ll see you in the morning go on home
poor boy
all he does is cash his paycheck and drink it
wanna have a look around with me
no i m not much of a detective
besides mrs avery is waiting for me
all right
good luck thanks
go find sheehan he s someplace on the lot
bring him here
mr drew
mr drew what happened
what happened
here here
swell ain t it
i made it myself
who s in there
it s all right sheehan
now
i found the gun that killed brent
where
right here in this lamp
why it s gone
probably got tired sitting there and decided to take a walk
no i m not kidding
i came down to the set to take a look around
just by accident i noticed this this smudge on the lamp here
so i looked inside
found a small derringer fastened there
attached to an electromagnet
there s the wire it was connected to
and i got a bump on my head that knocked me out
this proves one thing
whoever killed brent knew a lot about electricity
who s in charge of these lamps
the head gaffer
what s that in english
the chief electrician
who is he
al payne
where can i find him
tom will take you over
come here kid let me take a look at that head
that s all right
now listen
you stop monkeying around with police matters
it s a tough racket
that head of yours won t stand another wallop
come on let s get going
mr drew
the first thing i ask myself when i investigate a murder is whodunit
that sounds logical
and the next thing i ask myself is who could do it
and then
and then i ask myself again who wanted to do it
and how do you answer yourself
well
i ain t come to that yet
you take chalmers for instance
he didn t like brent
why shouldn t he be an exception
he didn t like brent on account of brent had him fired
when was this
a couple of months ago
when chalmers was head gaffer they had an argument
head gaffer
yeah chalmers is an electrician isn t he
yeah chalmers had a couple of drinks and him and brent had an argument
say gully you are a first-class gumshoe
investigator
all right investigator
right now will you run up to the casting office investigate and find out where chalmers lives
sure what are you gonna do
put the finger
i mean apprehend him
maybe
you wanna come along
oh boy i ll say
got your gun
yep
got my gun my badge
we ll need those
come on let s get going
the director hasn t anything to do with it
the channel man really sets the lights
you mean he tells you where to put the lights
yes
when was this set lit
the afternoon before
they rehearsed the scene with the principals so they wouldn t hold when they called the extras
do you remember anything particular about that one light
to be truthful with you we had a lot of arguments on that set
mr steiner didn t like the photography and he wanted more light
steiner
was he there when it was rehearsed
yes
who else
well they were all there with the exception of the extra people
there were no extras there huh
no only chalmers
you know he s a sort of a privileged character around this lot
he used to be our head gaffer
chalmers used to be an electrician
yes
miss lane felt sorry for him and made mr avery give him a bit in her picture
oh miss lane got him the job yes
could you give me the address of the cameraman and chalmers
sure
and by the way if a writer by the name of drew asks you anything don t answer him
* * * well you can t keep me from hoping
this is it
look
it s that chalmers in trouble again
do you wish to see mr chalmers
yes is he in mrs
miss potts and i don t know anything at all about his comings and goings
doesn t he answer the bell
no he doesn t
i was just going in
it s cleaning day today you know
i suppose he s lying stiff and the place all clotted up with gin bottles
let s go in and have a look around captain
as a tenant he wasn t so bad until he lost his job then he started acting queerlike
see i told you
i laid it all down to him
i said mr chalmers my bungalow court isn t an alcoholic ward
as i thought
drunk again
well this is the end
this is no key to cure
out he goes
i m sick and tired of his carryings on the fellow s dead
dead
well he didn t think of me no not him
i suppose my $ 28 50 back rent was all spent in booze
did i have chalmers spotted
all i did was ask myself whodunit
poison all right
familiar smelling stuff too
boy that guy would drink anything that wasn t too thick to chew
well i guess this about washes up the case huh mr drew
looks like suicide to you eh gully
sure
i guess sheehan would think so too
he may be dumb but he ain t blind
he s not as dumb as he looks
do you wear a wristwatch gully
huh
do you wear a watch on your wrist
well you see it s a present from the wife
i gotta wear it
why do you wear it on your left wrist
well i use my right hand the most because i m right-handed
did you ever try to write with it on you right wrist
no
neither did chalmers
which makes this note a very interesting piece of fiction
say gully
come here
take a look in here
now what do you see
a bottle of gin and a piece of ice
what else
use your powers of observation
oh you mean that piece of lettuce in there
don t you notice that little service door in the back has been left open
whatever
the icemen probably left it that way
my wife says you can t trust those icemen anyway
if the iceman had left that little door open when he put in the fresh cake there wouldn t be any ice there now
oh i never thought of that
let s have a look outside
look
someone must have stood here a long time
them are fresh footprints ain t they
step up there a minute
look out for those tracks
now what
look through the window
do you see chalmers sitting there
yeah
the door s open
supposing someone stood here and doctored chalmers gin in the icebox on this side and then stood here and watched him drink his last drink through the window what would you say
and then watched him die
then wrote the note and put the pencil in his hand huh
yeah
only that s where he made his mistake
put the pencil in the wrong hand
that s just what i was thinking
gully
you know if a car was parked here it would entirely conceal that door and that window
yeah
then chalmers didn t kill himself huh
let s leave that to sheehan
if i m any good of a guesser he ought to be here by now we found him tumbled over the table
dead huh
don t let sheehan know what we found out
i gotcha
the captain got here 15 minutes ago
captain
what are you and that keystone cop doing here
now looky here sheehan you can t talk that way about me
remember i m chief of the studio police and i got rights
i
i
nature in the raw
here s another opportunity for your skill lieutenant
we ve been waiting for you
everybody around here seems to know more about police matters than the police
that s noble of you to admit
did you two losers touch anything around here
nothing important
good then clear out
and take that uniformed moron with you
come on
suicide huh
looks like it
well i always thought it was chalmers right from the start
now who s the keystone cop
you don t even know chalmers was left-handed
come on
left-handed
sure
that starts it all over again
i can remember when murders were nice clean simple things done with machine guns and meat axes
but this case
keep coming
all right
what seems to be the trouble
battery s dead
but didn t miss lane get a new battery just last week
yeah i don t understand it
it s bone dry
the liquid s all gone
just as i thought
you were right
poison
the electro electrolytic * * * 38 % distilled water 33 % electrolytic liquid 11 % by volume the man said at least a spoonful would kill a man dead
electrolytic acid
did he say anything else
no that was all
hey
ain t them the same kind of tread that left the marks under chalmers window
there s probably a thousand cars in hollywood that have that make of tire
yeah i never thought of that
say gully
i want you to get me the key to brent s dressing room
but don t anybody know it s for me
say i ll get you the key to the city if you want it
i have a couple of things to do
i ll meet you here in half an hour
okay
who is it
frank may i come in
just a minute
why all the locks
i was just going through some old letters and didn t want to be disturbed
oh i see
where have you been
i ve been waiting all afternoon for you
oh i ve just been doing a little sleuthing
marcia you trust me don t you
why yes of course
you know i d do anything in the world for you don t you
i believe you would dear
then is there anything you know about the murder of brent that you haven t told me no
i ve just come from chalmers place
he s dead
chalmers
poisoned
you mean murdered
if it isn t that it s a good imitation on it
oh how awful
whoever did it used electrolytic acid
acid out of a battery
the unfortunate part of the whole thing is that they used your car and the acid out of your battery
my car
that s why my car wouldn t start
yes
i only told you this because i m afraid sheehan will find out and arrest you on suspicion
that would mean headlines and scandal
what do you want me to do
i want you to get out of here
any place just so sheehan can t find you
but that s running away
only for a day or two just to give me time
i ll go to mary s at malibu
she ll help me
that s swell
make it fast will you
there s no knowing how close sheehan is behind me
i ll telephone you when i have it all worked out
you may have a long beard by then but i ll try and hurry
bye-bye sweet
come in
leon
i suppose you re surprised that i m here huh marcia
frankly yes
you haven t come to see me since since brent s accident
i should think you d know why
i don t
i only know that i that i want to help you
i have all the help i need
marcia you mustn t treat me like this
i never said anything to you while brent was alive
but you should know how i feel
you ve succeeded in making your feelings quite plain enough
marcia i i m very fond of you
not the kind of fondness i care about
please go now leon i m in rather a hurry
marcia
maybe some day you will come to me and ask for help
maybe you will apologize to me for laughing about how i feel for you
perhaps brent wasn t killed for nothing
no matter how smart they are they always slip up
what s your name
pardon me
hello
yes sir i will
oh wait a minute here she is now
miss lane
mr steiner would like to see you in his office
thank you

what kind of a suit did he have on
there it is
funny sheehan missed looking in here
you ve been keeping him too busy
see what those letters are
here s one from a dame named agnes
agnes who
she ain t that dumb
she don t say much
except that uh she can t live without him
married too
says her husband don t understand her
well it s that old old story
two men and a woman
the internal triangle
what kind of place is the cliffside inn
you know one of those weekend places with all the mr smiths and mr jones and mr browns
brent wouldn t go there alone would he
not him
how far is ocean view from here
couple of hours north on the coast road
i guess that s our next stop
why
i m beginning to think there s a woman in the case
no
mr drew this case is becoming complicated
even for me
come on
gee it s 4 30
i gotta check in
listen don t go away without me will you all right gully
i ll pick you up at the gate on my way out
mr drew i ve been looking for you
miss lane wants to see you
she s in mr steiner s office
thanks
yes sir
go right in mr drew
when did you find out your car wouldn t start
about an hour ago
well with all your dabbling you didn t throw us off
you ve thrown yourself off if you think miss lane had anything to do with chalmers or brent either
all right all right just sit down there
and keep quiet
where did you go this afternoon
i went downtown
in your car
yes
where did you park it
on the street
in front of ellsmith s flower shop
i ordered some flowers for myles
mr brent s funeral
then where did you go
you went to chalmers house didn t you
wait a minute i won t stand for this
you can t trick miss lane into answers
and have little boy blue over there take them down
now keep quiet drew
we re trying to get to the bottom of this
oh no you re not
sheehan is trying to force miss lane into admission of things she s never done
she might as well talk here as downtown
i ve got a warrant for her
for what
suspicion of murder
what s your theory
it s as simple as abc
it would be if you thought of it
chalmers killed brent because he hated him and she offered him money
then she got frightened and killed chalmers thinking that he would get drunk and give it away
every piece of evidence we ve got points to her
it was her cigarette that blew the film her car that made the tracks outside chalmers house and acid from her battery that killed him
oh that s a lot of bunk
i know
you ve got to make an arrest
it s okay with you
steiner you can t sit there and let them arrest marcia
she has nothing more to do with these murders than lincoln had to do with the burning of rome
mr drew we don t know whether lincoln burned rome or not
and we don t care
but this man is a policeman so let us hear what he has to say
we are not paying you to quarrel with the police
i don t care if you pay me a dime
sheehan if you arrest miss lane now there ll be a lot of nasty newspaper headlines
hold out for another 24 hours and i ll be responsible
better than that i ll prove she s innocent
you re making yourself ridiculous
i m trying to protect one of your stars
wait a minute steiner
maybe he s right
what about this scandal
what about her box-office name
haven t we got enough trouble here already without having marcia arrested
mr grossmith if you want to accept the responsibility you can
but remember
this is a murder case
two people are dead
and how do you know someone else won t be killed
for my part i believe that the police should not be interfered with
well all i gotta say is that it s
a terrible calamity
let s go hillicker
i guess the explosion s over
someone in this studio killed myles brent and chalmers
and he s trying to pin it on marcia lane
but they won t get away with it
come on miss lane
marcia honey
i m sorry
but i ll get you out of this as soon as i can
i know you will frank
i m not worried really
come on
special issue
read all about it here
hollywood mystery
marcia lane accused of studio murder
extra
read all about it
how do you do sir
how do you do
i m from the publicity office at the tonart studio
yes i d like to see a list of the people who sent flowers to the brent funeral
oh i think i have a list thanks
terrible thing that brent murder wasn t it
i hear they re investigating marcia lane
yes i guess she ll be one who won t send flowers
yes she will
she was here early this afternoon and ordered a big wreath
is that so
here you are
mostly women
it s surprising many of them gave their names
oh some of them didn t
there was a lady here just now who signed a check then thought better of it and threw it out
didn t want the husband to see the cancelled check
perhaps
oh pardon me
yes madam do you have any gardenias
certainly
oh good evening
alone
yes i m not stopping
oh
i have a key here a friend of mine carried away with him
oh thank you
my name is drew
i m from the tonart studios
i d like to keep this thing quiet
keep what quiet
brent s visit here the night before he was murdered
you see if the papers get hold of a story like this they ll play it up and it s bad for the picture business
well it doesn t do us any good either
all right let s get together
sure what do you want
who was the woman with brent
mrs brent
there is no mrs brent
they were divorced
well then i don t know who she is
you see i wasn t here when they checked in and they left in such a hurry i didn t see them go out
in a hurry
why
well a fellow came in here and started a row
then he waited in that telephone booth over there and they came down and he stepped out
at least that s what charly says
who s charly
one of the night bellhops
could i see him sure
oh charly yes sir
this gentleman wants to ask you a few questions
shoot
do you remember seeing the man who waited for myles brent in the telephone booth the other night
i just got a glimpse of him before the fight
what fight
when brent hit him in the patio
how did it happen
the lady ran out to the car when she saw the guy came out of the booth
then the guy steps up to mr brent and says
brent i wanna see you
i thought it sounded kinda silly because he was seeing him right there
then what happened
brent takes the guy outside in the patio
that s when he socked him
then did brent get into his car
yeah
and the other guy picked himself up
boy was he mad
and was his face red
what did he say
what didn t he say listen
it was awful
and then he beats it
would you remember this man if you saw him again
well i might
and then again i might not
it all happened so fast
would you remember the lady
sure
say she was a honey
she talked kind of funny
like she was a foreigner or something
with an accent yeah
that s fine charly
you ve been a great help to me
here
thanks
good night and thanks
say are you a detective
no i m just from the studio
will there be detectives here
i hope not
call for mr wallace
calling mr wallace
which booth did that fellow hide in
there
how long has it been out of order
just since the guy hid in there
i guess he kept pounding on the hook
shelf shelf that s all you can think about shelf
already this picture cost me $ 239 351
better i put my money in the bank
can i get any interest from a shelf
i m not asking you to do anything
but how can we finish the picture without print
i told you 17 times that we can use a double
and play the whole kissing scene in a longshot
why not
because it s all wrong
it s terrible
i ve got my reputation to think of
and i ve got my money to think of money money
what s money
now just a minute
let s take it calmly
the new york office is of the opinion that the murder of brent won t hurt the picture
so why not shoot that scene with a double and wind it up
it s the last scene in the picture
it can t possibly do you any harm
exactly steiner s quite right
oh all right
what s the use of arguing with him
good
we can get the company together and shoot it tonight
wait a minute
what about marcia
oh we can arrange with sheehan to use her for that one scene
she can come over with the whole police department if he likes
everybody is on call everything on the set is standing
they can shoot it in half an hour
todd
oh hold on a minute
what time
seven thirty say nine thirty
make it nine o clock
we ll save a half hour
todd we are going to shoot the last scene of the death kiss tonight
round up the company for a nine o clock call
sure mr steiner
max we re retaking the death kiss
get busy on the call
okay
you have brent s double on call haven t you
yes i ll have him all right
but say what about miss lane
i ll take care of her
hey mac put that light over on the roof
screen 80 joe
good evening
you know mrs avery
yes of course
how are you
how do you do
i m surprised you ve come to see the retake
put it down to morbid curiosity
that s the woman of it
she insisted on coming
well come along with me
i ll have howell make you comfortable
he s very good with the ladies
put that light high
put it up
we ll do it the same way
you two girls in the back
on the left
watch out
gulliver
yes miss lane
do you know where mr drew is
he went away and left me after he promised he wouldn t
do you know where he went
i got an idea but i can t tell
do you know when he ll be back
i don t know
he ll turn up
you can t lose that guy
we re ready for rehearsal miss lane
all right thank you
go ahead
we ll wait here thank you
and just as you reach here miss lane steps up and kisses you
and much to your surprise because you don t know her
then you turn read your line to the doorman and walk out to the kerb
right
alas i m so sorry about it
i know it s going to be difficult for you but i ll try and help you all i can
thank you tom
oh do you know mr johnson
yes how do you do
shall we try it once
oh george let s have quiet please
quiet
rehearsal
take your places please
hit them on
everyone ready for rehearsal okay
camera
this business gives me a funny feeling
what do you mean
i don t know
just gives me a funny feeling that s all
supposing it should happen somebody else gets shot
that s ridiculous
well maybe it is maybe it ain t
anyway i don t like the set and i don t like the title of the picture
the death kiss ugh
from now on we have no more titles with death in it
getting superstitious
say you ain t got no nerves
i ain t afraid either
i m just a little scared that s all
what can possibly happen
that s it
anything
i must have been overlooking something
a bloody shame sir
most annoying
right under me very nose
wait a minute what s the matter now
i can t get it with the mike there
well go ahead and fix it the way you want it
swing it in here farther
come on farther
now down a little closer there
is that in your picture
no it s in place there okay
test it
one two three four
one two three four
microphone number two
all right let s go okay for sound
oh lieutenant
can i see you a minute
well if it isn t our little mystery writer
i knew you d turn up
have you solved it
come over here a minute
what s the revelation
i went through the clothes that brent wore the night he was murdered
i found a room key to the cliffside inn in his pocket
i went up to the inn and found that he d registered there the night before as mr and mrs brent
not unusual for him was it
no but the husband of the woman that was with him waited for brent in the telephone booth in the lobby
when brent came down they had a fight
brent beat him up and left with the woman
now there s your motive
the fellow who hid in the telephone booth is the fellow who murdered brent
it s a motive sure
but it seems to me that everyone around here had a motive
yes but the same man knew a lot about electricity and a lot about film
now chalmers couldn t have thrown that cigarette butt in the film because he was nowhere around at the time
marcia couldn t have poured acid on the negative
she knows less about film than you do
but the same fellow whoever it was found out that chalmers had discovered his contraption in the lamp
stole marcia s car took acid again doctored chalmers gin and then returned the car
but why did he take miss lane s car
to give himself a double headed out
if you believed that suicide gag it would be the end of it
if you didn t everything pointed to marcia
whatever happened he wouldn t be suspected
yeah
but you have got to show me that the guy who is at the end is someone here at the studio
and that he had access to the light the film the car and everything else
that s easy
the man who hid in the telephone booth left his trademark
what s this
well you know as well as i do
scribblings a man makes on a piece of paper are as identifying as a signature
oh now all we ve got to do is to find the guy that scribbled like this huh
i ve done that too
take a look at this
where did you get this
in grossmith s office
now avery steiner grossmith and howell were in there having a conference
and you think one of those four killed brent yes this is interesting
but i ve only your word for it and that don t count for much well i ll keep your paper dolls
but you ve got to get me more substantial evidence than this before i can let miss lane go
take good care of these guns boys and don t forget to check them back to me thank you
sure the gun isn t loaded
you bet not
i just looked
mind if i look
not at all
is that clear to you
all right we ll take it
is everybody ready
let s make it
johnson powder up will you please
sure
thanks
you re welcome
frank
i ve been so worried about you
darling i m hot on the trail
i ve got an idea
if i m right i ll have this whole thing wrapped up and tied before you know it
but don t go away before i m through will you
you bet i won t
miss lane will you stand in a minute please
see you later
it isn t loaded is it
what do you think i m crazy
mind if i look no go ahead
thanks
say bill those aren t the same guns you used before are they
i know
i couldn t get 38s before so i slipped in the 45s
nobody knew the difference
you mean 38s were called for before
yeah we made a row about it
who insisted
okay coming up
come on with me
listen
i ve got it
this is bill the property man
he tells me on the day that brent was murdered he was definitely ordered to give all the extras 38 caliber guns
yeah
did you get it
38 caliber guns were ordered
now if bill had supplied them we would never have known that it wasn t an accident
but he didn t
he had to use 45s
that s how he knew it was a murder
now the fellow who ordered those 38s
say who ordered those guns
go ahead bill tell him
well it was mr
turn those lights on
lights give me a light
here you are sheehan
there he is
there he goes up there
come on he went this way
no there he is come on
there he goes
stand where you are or i ll shoot
avery
mr avery
he s the that who ordered the guns
yeah and like a fool i told you about him under the microphone
he was listening in with the earphones
so it was him
don t look at him now
he s dead
he s dead
yes i am glad
the woman at the cliffside inn huh
you stay here hillicker come on come with me
i got him
i got him
there s your man
who is he
you ll suffer for this
you despicable cad
so you re a policeman eh
pardon me
i think i owe apologies miss lane
and to you too
i m sorry i was unpleasant
you know at first i could have sworn it was you
i knew it and it made me quite angry
but you re much more clever than i gave you credit for
well that sounds like a new contract
we ll talk about that later
oh lieutenant
would you mind telling me why it is that detectives always wear their hats even in the presence of ladies
sure
that s so we won t have anything in our hands or arms in case we have to use them
that s one for the book
do you mind if i write it in right now

mr parker
- you can t do that
- i ve got something in mind
- would you come with me please
- surely
- you understand you are an uninvited guest
- certainly
you may find our domain rather strange
i shall have to rely upon your caution while you re here
- and you re silence when you re gone
- of course doctor
limestone formation
curious isn t it
this was once the crater of a volcano
extraordinarily fertile this volcanic dust
seeds blown hereby the wind and brought by birds
see the result
don t be alarmed mr parker
you re quite expert with that whip aren t you doctor
it s a hobby
i learned to handle one as a boy in australia
there s my house
strange-looking natives you have here
you ll be wanting a cold shower i take it before dinner
an excellent brandy montgomery
i hope you brought plenty
then of course you did
montgomery is a man to trust mr parker
especially in the selection in the ordering of your liquors
m ling you may take everything
yes
you are a man of discretion mr parker
i hope so
now if you ll excuse us
- m ling brandy for mr
parker
- nothing more thank you
that ll be all m ling
you may go
i should much prefer that you don t leave this room
your wish doctor
i had my reasons for keeping you sober
- go to the laboratory
see what s to be done
- you re not going
i m taking her to parker
- lota to parker
- why do i brought him to the house
he s seen too much already
she s never seen anything like him
the only reactions we get from her are fear and terror
- that s understandable
- but how will she respond to parker
where there s no cause for fear
will she be attracted
is she capable of being attracted
has she a woman s emotional impulses
i d scarcely hoped for a chance like this short of london
lota
lota
come here
lota i e taught you many things
yes
- all that you know i ve taught you - yes
i m going to let you learn something for yourself
a man has come from the sea
i will take you to him
let you talk with him
yes
i m going to leave you alone with him
you may talk with him about anything about the world he comes from
but you must say nothing about me nothing about the law nothing about the house of pain
- you understand me
- yes
then come along with me
get out
get out i said
it s all right
go in lota
- this is mr
parker lota
- how do you do
- don t be afraid
- how do you do
mr parker has come to us from over the sea
she s a pure polynesian
the only woman on the entire island
well uh i l leave you two young people together
i ve got work to do
won t you sit down
cigarette
no
- i thank you
- you re welcome
you ll have to pardon me because
this is all very strange to me
what island are you from
tahiti
samoa
i mean where is your home
home
this my home
i know but you re not a native of this island
i know because i ve seen some of them
how does it happen that you re the only woman on this island
did dr moreau bring you here
pardon me if i seem to be too inquisitive
moreau
quickly please
you come from the sea
well rather
three days on an upturned lifeboat
you go away
tomorrow morning
i wish you would not go away
well that s very nice of you
but i must
you come back again
well i don t know
what s that
it s the house the house of pain
no no
it s nothing
it s nothing
nothing
somebody s being tortured
get out
get out
they re vivisecting a human being
they re cutting a living man to pieces
now i know about his natives
they re his victims
you and i may be next
come on
let s get out of here
other gate
we ll take moreau s boat and get away from here tonight now
sea
sea
sea
sea
man from sea
man from sea
lota
stop
stop
what
what
man from sea they are like us
they are like him
one is not man
- what is the law
- not to run on all fours
that is the law
- are we not men
- are we not men
- what is the law
- not to eat meat
that is the law
are we not men
are we not men
what is the law
not to spill blood
that is the law
are we not men
are we not men
his is the hand that makes
his is the hand that makes
his is the hand that heals
his is the hand that heals
his is the house
of pain
his is the house
of pain
i didn t think you d be idiotic enough to leave the house
now i can understand why you and your island stink from one end of the south seas to the other
what makes your natives such monstrosities
i saw you vivisecting a man
my dear young fool you re entirely mistaken
you can t get away with it in my case
take it
i m now unarmed and you re fully protected
it s quite evident that i mean you no harm
well would you be good enough to come to the house
lota
lota go to your room
i started with plant life in london 20 years ago
i took an orchid and upon it i performed a miracle
i stripped 100 000 years of slow evolution from it and i had no longer an orchid but what orchids will be 100 000 years from now
that s one there
yes but how doctor
by a slight change in the single unit of a germ plasm
that s a common lily
that s a chrysanthemum
that s unfortunately what happened to some asparagus
i went on with this research just as it led me
i let my imagination run fantastically ahead
why not experiment with the more complex organisms
man is the present climax of a long process of organic revolution
all animal life is tending toward the human form
i was still in london when i began this phase of my experiments
one day a dog escaped from my laboratory went shrieking into the streets and i left london
the newspapers at my heels aroused england crying for my blood
i picked up montgomery and brought him along
he was a medical student facing a prison term for a professional indiscretion
that was 11 long years ago 11 long years i ve worked
plastic surgery blood transfusions
gland extracts with ray baths
with what i have discovered in my own work among the cellular organisms
my work my discoveries mine alone
with these i have wiped out
hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
from the lower animals i have made with - -
go see for yourself mr parker
- you re convinced that this thing isn t human
- its cries are human
- you know what it is that i began with
- no
- an animal
- an animal
like those in the cages outside
then those creatures out in the jungle
are my creations
- they were made from animals
- yes
this thing this poor tortured creature - -
what does that matter
- of all things vile
- mr parker spare me these youthful horrors please
and those those poor things out in the jungle those animals they they talk
that was my first great achievement
articulate speech controlled by the brain
that was an achievement
oh it takes a long time and infinite patience to make them talk
someday i will create a woman and it will be easier
those are some of my less successful experiments
they supply the power to create others more successful
with each experiment i improve upon the last
i get nearer and nearer
mr parker do you know what it means to feel like god
i m talking too much aren t i
- good night mr parker
- good night
- you know the way to your room - yes thanks
i hope you sleep well
thanks
good night
did you see that
she was tender like a woman
how that little scene spurs the scientific imagination onward
i wonder how much of lota s animal origin is still alive
how nearly a perfect woman she is
it s possible i may find out
with the aid of mr
parker we won t have much time if he leaves for apia in the morning
wouldn t it be a great loss to science if he left for apia in the morning
i want to thank you doctor for the - -
- happy to have been of service to you
- i appreciate what you re - -
whoa
whoa this is most distressing
i i don t know what to say i can t account for it
unless the natives they were a bit out of hand last night
you said it mate
- hello darlin
how you been
- hello baby
did you miss me
- did i miss ya
- pardon me
excuse me
didn t you have a mr
parker on board - parker
- yes
oh you better talk to the skipper
now men stay sober
any drinking to be done i ll do it myself
if you get in a fight send for me - hello there baby

those creatures in the jungle were horrible enough but to have created that girl - lota

i could have overlooked those others
i could have shown you that much consideration
but now i l expose you to the world
- for what you really are moreau - when are you leaving
i think you d better sit down and make yourself comfortable
- would you care for a cup of tea
- no thank you
we may as well discuss this frankly now that you know the facts
lota is my most nearly perfect creation
i was thinking of taking her with me as exhibit a on a triumphal return to london
i wanted to prove how completely she was a woman whether she was capable of loving mating and having children
she was afraid of montgomery and myself
then you came
well she was very much attracted to you
you can see of course the possibilities that presented themselves
i l tell you this moreau
you ll make arrangements for me to leave this island as quickly as possible or this great scientific work you ve been doing will stop
how did he find out
what did you say to him
what did you do to let him know
what is it moreau

day by day it creeps back
it creeps back
you see this
the first of them all to shed tears
she is human

- this time i l burn out all the animal in her - no
aah
- i l make her completely human

this film was shot in 1932 soon after the founding of the spanish republic
the region we are going to visit is called las hurdes it s barren and inhospitable and man is forced to fight for subsistence
the first road to las hurdes was built only in 1922 before that it was unknown to the rest of the world and even in spain
on the way to las hurdes we pass la alberca it s a bit more prosperous but still feudal almost all the inhabitants of las hurdes are in debt to this town
the church at la alberca
two skulls in their niches symbolise the town s destiny
most homes have three storeys
this is rare in spain and gives the streets a medieval aspect
many homes have a religious text over the door
ave maria conceived without sin
the day we arrived the women were dressed in their finery
why were they dressed so beautifully
they said they were going to the plaza for an annual ceremony that s strange and barbaric
newly wedded men gather each must take up the head of a rooster
a rope extends across the street on it hangs a rooster tied by the legs
the men gallop by and try to catch a head
after parading in triumph with the heads the grooms offer everyone wine
it s a time for enjoyment
in the crowd a baby adorned with silver medals
they are like amulets from africa or oceania
by 7 pm almost everyone is drunk
3 kilometers away from a hill top we look down on the 52 villages of las hurdes they have a total population of ten thousand
down steep slopes to the valley of the batuecas inhabited by a solitary monk and his maid
for centuries this has been home to monks of the carmelite order they preached christianity in the villages of las hurdes
batuecas has a rich prehistory
skilful cave paintings representing men goats and bees
toads snakes and lizards are now the only inhabitants of these ruins
rich vegetation with more than 200 species of trees
yet 5 kilometres from this fertile valley there are almost no trees
just a few fruit trees rockroses and heather
the convent is surrounded by an 8 kilometer wall
it protects from attacks by wolves and wild boar
inside are the scattered ruins of 18 hermitages
each is marked by a cypress or two
beyond here lies las hurdes proper
we are entering the barren lands of las hurdes
the village of aceitunilla is in one of the poorest valleys
the white building is the school built recently
on its sloping streets we encounter daily life
strange but we never heard anyone singing in las hurdes
a miserable rivulet runs through the village down from the hills
in summer water in scarce
the villagers are obliged to use this filthy water
strange things go on here
the rivulet serves many purposes
three children eat a slice of bread dipped in water
until recently bread was almost unheard of here
it was given them by their teacher who makes the children eat in his presence fearing their parents will take it from them if they take it home
the children are summoned to school
these ragged barefoot urchins receive the same education as children the world over
clothing is brought back by hurdanos who leave each summer for castilla and andalusia
they go there mainly to beg
when they return they exchange clothing for potatoes
these hungry children are learning algebra
in some villages of las hurdes most of the children are orphans
they are abandoned children whom the women of las hurdes bring back from public assistance in cuidad rodrigo a two-day walk away across the hills
the women raise the children in exchange for 15 pesetas a month
this miserable sum is enough for an entire family until the not-so-distant day when the practice is outlawed
an unexpected and shocking picture we saw in the school
who could have made this absurd engraving
we opened at random a book of maxims we found on a table
one of the best students writes on a slate one of the book s maxims
it s the same the world over respect other people s property
in this relatively fertile valley there are some walnut cherry and olive trees
this is the village of martilandran
the shapes between the trees resembling the shell of some mythical animal are just the roof tiles of the village
entering the village we are greeted by a chorus of coughing
most of the villagers are ill
it s a scene of devastating misery
the principle disease here is goitre
look at this woman with her goitre
she s only 32 years old
we visit the village in the company of the mayor
on an empty street we see a girl
we ask the mayor what s wrong with her
he tells us the girl s been there 3 days without moving
she must be sick
one of us goes up to her to find out what s wrong with her throat
he asks her to open her mouth
her gums and throat are inflamed
sadly there s nothing we can do for her
two days later we returned to the village
we asked after the girl and were told she had died
what do the people of this sterile land eat
almost the only food here is potatoes and beans and then not always
especially in june and july there s not enough food
the only meat is pork
but only the wealthier families have a pig
once a year a pig is slaughtered
the meat lasts three days
olive trees grow in more fertile spots
but the olives are usually eaten by insects
the best animal for such infertile land is the goat
its milk is reserved for the gravely ill who mop it up with bread brought from afar by the beggars and given only to the sick
goat meat is only eaten when a goat dies
this happens from time to time on the steep slopes
the main industry in las hurdes is apiculture
but most of the hives don t belong to the hurdanos
and the honey the bees get from heather is very bitter
the owners of the hives are from la alberca
they only let the hurdanos have the hives in winter
it s milder here than in the neighbouring province of salamanca
in spring they take the hives to castilla
then it s common to see pack animals laden with hives heading for castilla
one day we came across a donkey laden with hives
two hurdanos are taking it to salamanca
later while we were eating we were asked for help
the donkey was tied up and one of the hives had fallen
it was being attacked by bees
it tried to defend itself but more hives had fallen
and swarms of bees had descended on it
an hour later it was dead
may and june are the hardest months in las hurdes
the potatoes have run out
the villagers eat unripe cherries
it gives them dysentery
this is when the exodus begins
all the able-bodied men who don t have a fever head for castilla or extremadura to find work in the fields
we came across several of these caravans of 10 30 50 men
they were carrying only a blanket
they have neither money nor bread and they are going on foot to find work
we came upon another group several days later
they were returning as they d come without money or bread
how do the hurdanos prepare the land to grow their crops
first they choose a spot close to the riverbank
then they cut down the rockrose and heather
their tools are rudimentary pickaxe and shovel
these are the only tools they have
the plough is almost unknown
once the plot has been cleared they put up stone walls without mortar
the wall will protect the plot from winter floods
one the wall is up they have to look for fertile soil in the hills
they put it in sacks and carry them through the brambles to their plots
this usually takes several weeks
a thin layer of fertile soil now covers the plots
the first year sees an abundant harvest but then the soil is exhausted
there s no nitrogen and it turns sterile
all the plots in las hurdes are thin bands beside a river
winter storms can destroy the work of a whole year
a characteristic winding river in las hurdes with tiny plots beside it
with no money or domestic animals the hurdanos have no fertiliser
they have to go up into the hills to look for it
that s what this family is doing
the way is hard and footwear is scarce
the best fertiliser is made by the hurdanos themselves from the dry leaves of the strawberry tree
they fill their sacks with the precious leaves
but there are many snakes hereabouts
this villager was bitten a few days ago while collecting leaves
the bite itself is hardly ever mortal
but by trying to cure themselves the hurdanos sometimes die
having collected their leaves the villagers return home
they spread out the contents of their sacks indoors
people and animals alike sleep on the leaves
the leaves gradually decompose and several months later they can be used as fertiliser
a house in fragosa
a bed of leaves extends from the doorway
every home in las hurdes is like this
a typical interior
the utensils are primitive and few
the smoke escapes where it can
there s no chimney or windows
in summer the water courses run almost dry
this leads to malaria brought by anophelese mosquitos
almost everyone in las hurdes has malaria
a battle against the disease is being fought by doctors in the three trading posts of las hurdes
the larvae have to rise to the surface to breathe
if it stays parallel to the surface it s anophelese
if it stays perpendicular it s a culex larva and harmless
the adult anophelese is found in every home
see how it rests perpendicular to the wall
the outcome of an anophelese bite
this man has a fever
we encounter many sick people in the streets
this sick woman on a balcony is unaware of our presence
balconies are rare in las hurdes
there are many dwarfs and cretins in las altas hurdes
their families usually employ them as goat herds
some are dangerous
they flee from other people or attack them with stones
they are found at nightfall in the hills as they return to their village
we found it very hard to film them
the realism of a painting by zurbaran or ribera is nothing to reality itself
the degenaration of these people is caused mainly by hunger lack of hygiene poverty and incest
the shortest person here is 28 years old
an older cretin
we were only able to film these virtual savages with the help of a friend from las hurdes who acted as intermediary
one day we saw a group of people in front of a doorway
a child has just died
the mother
a death is one of the rare events in these miserable villages
the women gather at the house of the deceased
it s hard to transport a corpse
most villages don t have a cemetery
they have to take this child to the cemetery in nunomoral
we decided to follow
the body was placed on a trough and carried for several miles through the thickets
if the dead person is an adult the body is tied to a ladder and carried to the cemetery
it s a journey that can take hours
crossing a river with a corpse
despite the misery in which the hurdanos live their moral and religious sense is the same as anywhere else in the world
each grave is indicated by a cross
or by a piece of wood
the only luxuries in las hurdes are the churches
this is in one of the poorest villages
a better-off home
father son daughter-in-law and two grandchildren
the paper cut-outs on the wall add a touch of interior design
in some villages a woman roams the streets at night
she announces deaths
she rings a bell and stops to pray
everyone lives in a single room
but this home is a little more comfortable
there s a stable on the ground floor and upstairs a kitchen and living space
there s even a bed
in winter the hurdanos sleep fully clothed
the wear their clothes until they wear out
this woman says
nothing keeps one awake more than thoughts of death
or reciting an ave maria for someone s soul
we left after two months in las hurdes
the misery shown in this film is not without remedy
elsewhere in spain hill people peasants and workers have achieved better conditions through mutual self-help
they have made demands of the authorities for a better life will give impetus to the coming elections and lead to a popular front government
the military rebellion backed by hitler and mussolini seeks to bring back the privileges of the rich
but the workers and peasants of spain will defeat franco and his cronies with the help of anti-fascists from all over the world civil war will give way to peace work and happiness
and the miserable homes you saw in this film will disappear for ever

lovely are the maidens in batavia
dear god he must have gone out of his mind from terror
a pathological condition that is not as rare as one might suspect
exposure to catastrophes such as explosions earthquakes and railway accidents - in short exposure to fright and horror often triggers insanity
perhaps the most interesting case of such pathological conditions is the case of dr mabuse
here he goes again
i shall briefly recount the history of this case
the patient lived a decidedly double life
he was a renowned doctor with a large private practice
aided by an almost superhuman logic he used his profound knowledge of hypnosis to commit crimes of a magnitude previously deemed impossible
for months the police sought the mastermind behind those crimes the man behind the curtain at last they discovered his whereabouts
but mabuse decided not to flee but rather to mount armed resistance and he barricaded himself in his house with four loyal henchmen
he refused demands to surrender to state authorities saying
i am the state
a barrage of bullets forced the police to retreat finally soldiers stormed the house with hand grenades
two of the defenders were killed
two were captured
mabuse however had disappeared
one prisoner revealed his hiding place
a counterfeiting lab from which he planned to launch a massive attack on the german currency system
the police force their way in to seize him only to find he had gone hopelessly insane
judging by his incoherent remarks he had seen during the previous night the ghosts of all those he had slain
apparently it was the horror of that experience that overpowered this phenomenal mind which for so long had straddled the fine line between genius and madness and literally deranged it
mabuse was committed to an insane asylum and to this day has not spoken a word to anyone
silent and motionless he remains in the position you see here
the patient withdrew into his own ego depriving us of any glimpse into his inner life
but suddenly the clinical profile changed
we observed that mabuse s hand continuously made writing motions in the air on the wall and on the bedspread
we gave him pencil and paper
at first he covered the paper with senseless scribbling
two years ago however certain words began to appear on the paper then sentences began to form still meaningless and confused
gradually they grew more coherent and logical and at last we began to get glimpses into the extraordinary phenomenon that was his mind
his thoughts still move in the same criminal channels as before
whatever mabuse writes is based upon incontrovertible logic and serves as a perfect guide for the commission of crimes worked out to the minutest detail
no
nothing can happen to us if we follow the doctor s methods - oh yeah - what do you mean oh yeah
the first attacks on the snitch failed
so what tough luck
so we called in division 2-b to handle the matter
if they succeed fine
and if they don t - if it looks like that snitch might rat on us - one single phone call and this whole place gets blown sky-high
stop scratching fritzi
it won t come to that
before that guy can open his mouth he ll be done for
i d feel better if they didn t resort to murder what do you mean murder
a guy can have something fall on his head can t he
a nice clean little accident
i don t care how you make it look i just don t want anything to do with murder
can t bear the sight of blood
let me tell you something though it s really none of your damn business
i ve killed two people i know what it means to kill
and that s precisely why
i want nothing to do with murder leave him alone fritzi what do you know about kent
the phone
yeah
bravo
just 20 minutes later
lohmann himself
continue writing
hofmeister himself has disappeared
the rug has been moved toward the window
he was on the phone when the lights went out where s the light switch - here by the door
so it came from over there the unknown horror the thing that caused his mind to snap
and he backed away from it step by step right up to the window
i wonder if he - no he couldn t get out this way certainly not downward
actual letters scratched into the glass with a ring
so he was trying to tell me something
is that a w
no
could it be a name it may take us a while to figure that one out
hey kruger - yes inspector
take this pane of glass to my office at headquarters
and see that you don t break it or i ll bite your head off
that s odd
i wonder what s behind that
thank you
keep a careful eye on him tonight i don t like his pulse in any case give him a shot later so he can get some rest
yes professor
their famous chocolate shake and a double mocha for you sir
- with hot cream - as usual very well
and now tell me tom why did you ask to see me so urgently today
don t you know what today is lilli
today
won t you tell me
certainly
a chocolate shake and a double mocha with hot cream
you ask what day this is
exactly one year ago today at the employment office -
good heavens my friend are you back again
i ve told you a hundred times there s no point in coming every day when we have work for you we ll certainly notify you
i ve been waiting for three months
be reasonable reasonable
what does reasonable mean when a man is going under
i want to work
but they keep pushing me closer to the edge
it s enough to drive a man to crime
he s forced to become a criminal
he marches in here and causes a riot
don t get so worked up
we have others to attend to - come now
- leave him alone he s sick
- come now - don t touch me
i ll go on my own
you ll never see me again here
- next please you ve seen the last of me
here are 20 marks
it s all i have right now but i d like you to have it
it may help you out i don t want charity
i want work not a handout
it s not a handout
it s just a loan i m sure you ll be able to pay me back
please
and six months later you found work and promptly paid back my 20 marks
tell me lilli have you ever been in love
it s high time i was going here comes my bus
- please stay - i can t
good-bye tom
call me good-bye
if you ll be seated doctor the professor is due back any moment thanks winkler
i m sure i ll find what i need
ah i see it s on his desk
oops
oh dear
this junk isn t even numbered
notes by dr mabuse september 1st - october 31st
how does this go together now
no the other way around
then this page what s the next part jewel -
no
jewel ry store
jewelry store specializing in high-quality
what
the least conspicuous and therefore most effective precaution to prevent interruption by police pedestrians and clients is to pull the shades and hang a sign on the door
closed from 10 00 to 2 00 for inventory well i ll be
the criminals then lowered the shades and hung a sign outside the door closed from 10 00 to 2 00 for inventory if that isn t something
that s incredible
immobilize the staff by using gas in bulbs of thin glass which will burst almost inaudibly when tossed
gas amazing
identical almost to the word
the criminals appear to have tossed bulbs of thin glass filled with gas bulbs of thin glass filled with gas if that isn t odd
it s as if they were following a blueprint
what are you doing there baum
this is the most incredible thing you could imagine
look here what is this
where did you get these papers
you know what they are
yes of course
now read this
ingenious jewelry heist
that s right read it
jewelry stolen valued at 250 000 marks
gas was used on the employees
yes just as if they were following your dr mabuse s instructions
a curious coincidence now wait just a minute
you call that a coincidence
- what else
baum old man coincidences like that just don t happen
there s some connection in all this or i ll eat my hat
say i ve got a crazy idea
could this mabuse fellow be faking it
tell me do you think that after treating a patient for years
i can t judge whether he s really sick or just pretending i didn t mean it like that but there must be something behind all this
you know what a genius this fellow was
it s just possible that his dead brain has come back to life
couldn t mabuse be writing these things as a sort of blueprint for a gang of accomplices you ve always had a wild imagination
just hear me out
what if mabuse with his incredible hypnotic powers engaged in some kind of telepathic hypnosis from his cell
say what you like but there s something weird going on
who else besides you knows about mabuse s notes
you sound just like a policeman
i think the police should be informed of this strange coincidence
- the police - of course well perhaps -
of course you re right
the police would want to know of this of course i ll go to them at once
if i can i ll call you from the station
good-bye
it s been raining - thank you winkler
- good-bye
let me repeat that back
a small blue dkw license plate 1a 74259
intersection of grüner winkel and körnerstrasse
we ll take care of it körnerstrasse and grüner winkel license plate 1a 74259
faster or we ll miss him
ingenious jewelry heist stolen jewelry valued at 250 000 marks
pearls platinum gold
one can do a lot with that
can could
but what will be done with it
what s gonna happen with that quarter million careful
i ask you -
will you stay down
what becomes of it i ask you
we buy cocaine with it morphine heroin opium whatever you call all that crap
and instead of making a killing off the dope and fleecing the types who are crazy for the stuff they practically give it away
what good does it do the boss to pump the world full of dope and not make any money off it
these things won t stay down what does it get him
i follow his instructions and drive ten people nearly crazy with threats and blackmail
and when they re ready to pay any sum we ask then i m told to back off and forget about the money
only result is they re driven crazy from fear of a scandal is that any business of yours old boy
did you ever fail to get your pay on time
that s not what i m saying okay then
you handle the blackmail and i see to your alibi
we get our paychecks like clockwork so what are you growling about
i just don t get it
if a woman throws herself out the window or a fellow blows his brains out like that bank director blackmail letters aren t of much use
150 grand tossed in the gutter
ls there any sense in that
or take the new instructions about the explosives and stealing poison from drugstores - that s scary business
as it s meant to be my dear fellow but why in the devil s name
i think you ask too many questions the boss doesn t like that
what you know him
no more than you do or anyone else in our gang
and i m not the least bit curious
i learned my lesson from your predecessor
he just had to find out what the man looked like the man behind the curtain the boss
so one day without having been summoned he snuck into the famous room with the curtain
or rather what was left of him
cut it out man you re spoiling my appetite
we re well paid
in fact very well paid
if something goes wrong we ll have cast-iron alibis or a top-notch lawyer
the boss thinks of everything and takes care of everything and demands not a penny for himself of all the loot
not a penny
see
why doesn t he take a single penny for himself
i can t understand that and that s what s got me jumpy
lots of others in our gang probably feel the same and would like to be done with the whole thing but just don t know how
dearest lilli you dashed off so quickly this afternoon that i had no chance to say what i wanted to tell you i -
- dr mabuse
you say you searched the furthest precincts and found no trace of hofmeister his description was sent to all officers
inspector lohmann asks if you had the hospitals searched
a special squad did that and hofmeister hasn t been admitted anywhere
- damn it - you ll call back wait a minute
get a picture of hofmeister from the files
we may need to have posters printed up
now then what is your assessment of the murder in the automobile
so far all i know is that the killer used a 7 65-mm dreyse pistol from 1906 production of which ended in 1916
this weapon was fired from a distance of not more than 25 feet
no empty shells were found in the street nor on the sidewalk and the bullet s trajectory indicates the shot was not fired from a window but rather from a point almost level with the victim s head
we may therefore conclude the shot was fired from another vehicle
another vehicle
that would be very interesting indeed
that opens up a whole new perspective
inspector lohmann s office not bad excuse me inspector
it s habermann this is about the kramm homicide
inspector we ve traced the murder victim s actions up until 6 10 on the evening of the murder
where he was from then until the time of death we have not yet been able to establish
see that you find out where he was those last two hours very well
müller arrange to have - no wait
where s the text for the kramm homicide poster
here it is
all information will be kept confidential -
put another line in here
especially concerning the hours from 6 00 to 8 00 p m
i ll do it myself
photo department
trouble
i don t know
i m just doing it now
enlargements naturally
trace the scratches and see if you can t link them together into a word or name or something
i m sure hofmeister intended to - inspector they found hofmeister
where the police station at schöneberger ufer
a police patrol found him
at first they thought he was just another drunk because he kept babbling to himself incessantly
but then they heard him call your name inspector lohmann
why won t you listen to me for god s sake
inspector you must listen to me
it s a matter of life and death
inspector lohmann please listen for the love of god
the moment he thinks he s being watched he starts singing
when he thinks he s alone he calls your name
i ll leave you alone now
hofmeister don t you recognize me
hofmeister it s me lohmann
your old friend lohmann
my god
inspector lohmann why don t you come to the phone
for god s sake come to the phone inspector lohmann
come to the phone
detective inspector lohmann who is it please
inspector
is that you hofmeister
this is lohmann
we ll have no other choice but to commit the poor devil to an institution
poor devil eh
heaven help me if i ever get my hands on the scoundrel responsible for that fellow s condition
then he suddenly got an expression in his eyes those eyes that leave you practically paralyzed
the eyes of a man who -
if he were in his right mind
i believe he could compel people to do his will right from his cell
the professor must come the professor is working and doesn t wish to be disturbed
winkler this is mabuse
- not so loud - the professor will fire me on the spot
with great disconcertment i have found out that in the hofmeister matter surveillance at the print shop failed in the most irresponsible way
don i interrupt i didn t ask for your opinion
the hofmeister affair would have turned into a catastrophe of the first order if not for the excellent work of division 2-b
hi come back to that later even so in the future all security measures protecting our organization will be made much more stringent
anyone constituting a menace to our organization is to be eliminated without exception
kent it has come to my ears that you - perhaps due to something in your past - that you do not approve of certain of my organization s measures
i m warning you kent - and i never give more than one warning -
in the near future you will have to prove that you are absolutely committed to our organization and that you know what you are being paid for
it s really none of my business but i don t think you re taking the doctor s warning seriously enough
oh yes i am division 2-b no one in the organization gets out of it alive
it s hopeless
there s no turning back
i must say farewell forever and i can t even tell you why
but there s no other way for me to behave decently towards you
you will never know what you ve meant in my botched life
it is very difficult to say good-bye to you lilli
forget me - though i shall never forget you
those scratches on the windowpane inspector
it took me forever to discover he was writing as if in a mirror
using his left hand and behind his back if you flip it over see there
quite clear
wasn t he that -
that doctor back during the economic crisis quite right
i ve got him 1920 - 1921
dr mabuse the gambler come on let me see that
let s see what business he has being on that windowpane
when lohmann has untied all the knots then you may sweep up as much as you like
but until then he ll go wild as an ape if you touch anything and he bites i d like to see him try müller
the old man s coming get out
müller come here
ca up 69-19-902
that s the mental hospital run by professor baum where they committed a certain dr mabuse
i d like to know if he s still there
when
dr mabuse died this morning
this morning
today of all days
that is quite peculiar
tonight at 12100
something big is on for tonight it seems
we ve been called in as have divisions 5 and 9 as well as section 2-b
- good lord - it s no use kent
the doctor is more powerful than you
and this corpse is clearly identified as mabuse
there s no doubt of that
unfortunately not inspector
unfortunately it is only too certain that this dead man here is dr mabuse or was
alas
ls smoking permitted here
seems to me to be slightly let s say -
do you smoke
- no thanks let s say slightly exaggerated
in the case of dr mabuse we re not dealing with a human being of value but with an evil criminal who only escaped the gallows by entering an insane asylum
one less insane criminal in the world silence you have no idea
no one has any idea what kind of phenomenal superhuman mind has come to an end with dr mabuse s death
this mind would have laid waste to our whole rotten world which is long overdue for destruction
this godless world devoid of justice and compassion consisting only of selfishness cruelty and hatred
this mind would have destroyed mankind which itself knows only destruction and extermination and which could only have been saved in its final hour through terror and horror
mabuse the criminal mabuse the genius
his intellectual legacy would have turned your world with its police protection on its head
his legacy
you speak of mabuse s legacy
no yes
of course not a testament in the accepted sense of the word
just some of his notes of interest only to physicians and men of science
i m afraid professor that you underestimate the number of subjects in which i take an interest
wasn t a young man admitted to your institution earlier today by the name of hofmeister
may i see that man
i m terribly sorry inspector
that man seems to be suffering the effects of some frightful experience that he relives each time someone approaches him
then he begins singing like a frightened child sings in the dark
i must therefore request for the good of the patient that you refrain from seeing him now what is it
forgive me professor we only wanted to - they re waiting for you in anatomy class
yes of course
well i see the doctor s cell is already occupied again
yes the new one who arrived last night the professor ordered that he be isolated
the doctor s cell just became vacant so we put him in it
it s strange when you come to think of it for 10 years i ve cared for the doctor and now he lies down there in the morgue
or what s left of him tonight at 12100 - dr mabuse
february 15th to march 31st
the empire of crime
humanity s soul must be shaken to its very depths frightened by unfathomable and seemingly senseless crimes crimes that benefit no one whose only objective is to inspire fear and terror
because the ultimate purpose of crime is to establish the endless empire of crime
a state of complete insecurity and anarchy founded upon the tainted ideals of a world doomed to annihilation
when humanity subjugated by the terror of crime has been driven insane by fear and horror
and when chaos has become supreme law then the time will have come for the empire of crime
you have the special maps for the northern area
the fire in the chemical factory in quadrants e-9 and k-14 -
repeat that
quadrants e-9 and k-14
they are to be concentrated so as to spread the blaze mainly to the storerooms and depots
is that clear - yes sir by the time the fire crews arrive the flames must be impossible to subdue
actions against banks and currency
- division 3 - yes and dr hauser
per my orders the letters incriminating the signatory of the overseas bank were not returned to him even when very large sums were offered until he agreed to comply completely with our demands
we are now in possession of duplicate keys to every one of the bank s vaults as well as combinations to all the safes and plans for all alarm systems
only after successful completion of our mission will the letters be returned good turn the material over to division 3 and wait downstairs
h need you later - yes sir
division 3 you are to bundle the completed counterfeit bills this morning and affix the stamps of the overseas bank
per the instructions you have just received at exactly 11 00 tomorrow night you will break into the bank and replace the bills now deposited in the bank with the counterfeit bills so that the bank itself will distribute the counterfeit money the bank guards are to be killed killed
there mustn t be the slightest clue to suggest the safes were opened
once everything has been executed according to plan the bank s alarms must be set off to simulate a burglary interrupted in progress
do you understand - yes sir division 3 is no longer needed
i was here in the afternoon too but you weren t home
so i waited tom a terribly long time
won t you at least offer me a seat in return tom
i like rooms that have such wide tall windows
is this true
yes tom
and i gave you my answer tom but you don t even know who i am lilli
my dear tom isn t that entirely beside the point
beside the point
entirely beside the point
we ll see right now whether it s beside the point
there you have it in black and white - just who i am
official confirmation with the seal and signature of the prison director and everything that goes with it
- prison - yes prison
four and a half years in prison
the last six months commuted for good behavior
there why should i care tom i love you
you don t know why i was in prison
i killed two people
one was my girlfriend and the other was the man i d thought was my best friend
why should i care tom i love you
then i m forced to tell you the rest lilli
i lied to you lilli
well i certainly did do you know where
in a counterfeiting lab
that s one place that can use an engineer who s an ex-con
if i had only known what i know now
along with destruction of the crops water supplies must be poisoned
epidemics of every kind must break down any resistance on the pad of the people a warning to unreliable elements will not be issued again
the slightest sign of treachery will be punished immediately by death
you see lilli this time you don t say
why should i care tom i love you
look tom
when i received your letter did you really think me so dense that i wouldn t sense the despair in your heart
i thought to myself what he needs is to regain his faith in himself to believe that everything can turn out well again
and i thought to myself
maybe you can restore his faith in himself if you tell him how much you care for him
and that you will stand by him for better or for worse
and so i came to you tell me have you taken it upon yourself to rob me of my last shred of sanity
yes tom
you you
i guess i have no other choice
i must report that kent didn t show up
believe me tom your life is just beginning
a brand-new life clean spotless and good
it s true tom
we ll put it all behind us and make a fresh start
and you know who ll help us
help us
yes tom the man who once -
when he had to arrest you he was so decent and compassionate towards you
lohmann
he claims to have some important news
give me a cigar and raise the shades then show him in
morning inspector what is it
scholz and i think we ve stumbled across something -
lower those shades clumsy fool
we stumbled across something that might lead us to the jewelry robbers is that so
we saw a girl running around with a big pearl necklace
she could tell me anything at all that she bought the thing at woolworth s for 25 pfennigs
but scholz knows about these things and he swears that necklace is genuine
well is it
so far all we know is that she s the sweetheart of a scoundrel who s an expert on anything having to do with jewelry robberies
where are the others
off you go then but remember
be careful
kent
you were ordered to prepare the strike against the overseas bank
you failed to carry out your orders
failure to obey is tantamount to treason
the penalty for both offenses is death let the woman go free
do with me what you like but let her go free
good god
you will never leave this room alive
what s that
tom what s that
you ll be taking over kent s job by the way
he won t be able to do it anymore
he s otherwise engaged
who could that be how do i know maybe it s the mailman
hold on
who is it the gas man
i d like to inspect the meter
afternoon miss
you want to look at the meter
come back some other time i ve got company right now
- police open up look out
police - don t shoot
- shut up you idiot get out
quick out the back door
now we re really done for
that guy will call all his cop friends
and on a sunday too
what re you crying about
it s your own damn fault for firing at him leave me alone you hear stop giving me a hard time

i ll try to hit the guy and keep him back from the door
stay back
notify the special tactics squad and get hold of -
damned scoundrel
who should i get hold of
it s no use we ll never get out this way
we could try to break through that
but the brick maybe
damn it hey how far are you in there
i can t hold this door forever
lohmann and his whole gang are here
lohmann that s it i m out
get yourself killed all of you
what do you mean by that
what do i mean i ll tell you what i mean
watch the door
out of the way hardy be sensible
it s no use
let me talk to them
let me tell you something
anyone who gets near that door inside or out is gonna get it understand
go keep an eye on them move it
almost now
let s see now
anni get some towels
come on quick
it s no use
better keep an eye on the door
- you and your stupid shooting
bredow shoot anyone who comes near the door
i ve had enough of this business
i ve got you now
open up it s lohmann what s the matter
- who are you to forbid anything
i won t land in jail cause of you
think i ll let you cowardly swine send me to the slaughter
be sensible
it s no use
i ll give you one last chance
if you re reasonable we ll be reasonable too
now open the door and put your hands up
- five inspector one two three
a dreyse pistol
what do you know a dreyse pistol no less
apparently the former owner - a friend of yours -
- no - no
that s funny it says here that the two of you were close friends
it s signed by karetzky diamond anna and her sweetheart
one shouldn t forsake a friend who s died i m not forsaking him
that s more like it
so your old buddy held on to this gun because he was used to it
i m no gun expert that s right you re more of an expert on automobiles
what make of car did dr kramm drive a hanomag or a dkw
who dr kramm the guy you two rubbed out from your car
god almighty
there there steady lilli
my dear little lilli
there might be another way
it s a long shot
- what if we flood the room with water - water yes
it just might break through the wall for us
if the water rises and we re -
- here you are inspector
- thank you
so you don t know anything about dr kramm s murder
the first i heard of it was right here
let me show you something come here come come
take a look at this still life you re familiar with this here
a 7 65-mm dreyse pistol made in 1906
it belonged to your friend he shot himself with it didn t he
yes
fine
but do you know what s in there no
take that magnifying glass and take a careful look at these two easter eggs
well see any difference no not the slightest
you see my boy that s just it none of us police could detect any difference either neither with the magnifying glass nor in the photographs
these two bullets are so completely identical that they could only have been fired from the same gun
yet one was taken from the skull of the deceased dr kramm and the other was found in the skull of your dead friend hardy
glass of water my lad
- cigarette
so now tell me why your friend hardy shot and killed dr kramm
- i can t tell you that inspector - liar kill me if you like but i don t know what hardy s orders were
- so you had orders - not me
from whom
i couldn t tell you inspector
i ve never seen the man in my life now enters the mystery man
so you don t know the man s name
on my honor inspector i don t know who gave hardy those orders
then there s nothing we can do
dictate for the record what you know about the whole case
yes inspector - müller - yes inspector
it was like this mr assistant inspector i was just -
i was just washing my car because everything has to be in top shape in these days of keen competition suddenly the phone rings and hardy picks it up
then he came and said we were to catch up with dr kramm s car at the intersection of körnerstrasse and grüner winkel
sergeant take this man away
isn t professor baum s insane asylum on grüner winkel
yes inspector so that s where dr kramm spent his final two hours
nothing on him
professor it s police headquarters
inspector lohmann wishes to speak to you
this is professor baum
this man swears you ve been treating him for the last two months
i think he s just trying to establish an alibi
i d like to confront him with you
without him knowing who you are of course
could you come over right away thanks a million professor
inspector when are you going to let me out of this monkey cage
my dear fellow we re glad we ve got you in there
well professor do you know that man
is he the one no inspector
sorry to disturb you inspector but we need your signature here
perhaps you might wait in my office
room 204 at the end of the hall
- thanks
- any of you know that man
- no inspector - no
- never seen him before
murder - 2 000 marks reward
sad business isn t it
especially for you since you were a close friend of the victim
yes we were on excellent terms as colleagues
the poor fellow even visited you on the day of his death
you could have saved us a lot of work professor if you d reported that to the police
especially concerning the hours from 6100 to 8100 p m
this request was published in every newspaper and posted on kiosks all over the city
and today s the first time i ve been in town in four weeks
dr kramm came to look something up in a scientific book in my library
he left in the best of spirits
as for his death it s as much a mystery to me as it is to you
then i m terribly sorry to have troubled you for nothing
why it s kent
who
him
i asked you if you knew him
where would i know him from i have no idea yet you just spoke his name
i did
that was you inspector
inspector i must speak to you
it s terribly urgent
i suppose i may leave inspector my time is -
of course
by all means professor
just a moment kent
many thanks for coming
go on in
it s all right
- it s tremendously important - - just a moment this is crucial
do you know that man who just left
- no
i ve never seen him before
damn it
and what is the name of this boss you mention
dr mabuse goddamn it
mabuse again
that fellow is dead
he s alive and kicking i tell you
i saw the cadaver myself bless you
i think the two of us are living proof of that though as for living that was pure luck
inspector i put myself completely in your hands
last night
i could have fled but i didn t because i realized this is about more than my life or liberty
my god how can i convince you
is this proof enough for you tonight at 12100
typewritten that s no proof
someone else
i m not in for anybody no exceptions yes professor
all the evidence leads again and again to that insane asylum
müller get the car i may be putting my neck on the line but i m going out there once more and you re going with me kent
mabuse is still alive
- i d like to speak with professor baum
- i m afraid that s impossible the professor can see no one just tel
him that police inspector lohmann wishes to see him gentlemen it s really impossible
the professor gave strict orders not to disturb him
my good man i must speak with him now go on and announce me
but inspector -
i do not wish to be disturbed
what is it
i do not wish to be disturbed
i clearly said i did not wish to be disturbed
that s his voice
nice little contraption very clever
no wonder you failed to recognize the man s voice
you only heard a mechanical reproduction of it
but where is he hiding
what s this a map of the northern part of town
that must be the löhr stegerwald chemical factory
and today s date strange
very strange
there s something else here
it s in pencil
8 30 p m and today s date
it s now 9 10 kent call the chemical plant
there won t be anyone there but they must have guards
and here s something else
notes by dr mabuse
isn t that interesting
go ahead good lord the chemical factory
here s your line inspector
police headquarters inspector lohmann
- nothing
krause
where s my driver
krause
where is that guy
krause i ll drive inspector

the empire of crime
the empire of crime
permit me to introduce myself
my name is mabuse
dr mabuse
for heaven s sake
who opened that door run and get help
he ll kill him
police we re looking for -
inspector
come my boy
there s nothing left to do here for a mere police inspector
on yonder rock reclining
that fierce and swarthy form behold
fast his hand his carbine hold
tis his best friend of old
this way his steps inclining
his scarlet plume waves o er his brow
and his velvet cloak hangs low
playing in careless flow
tremble

did you get a goose for us to pick
goose is the very word
a skinny old lord who simply stinks with gold and his pretty wife whose jewels sparkle like an early frost on a december morning
- did you steal them
- of course not
she knew me only as the marquis de san marco and as such i could only sing her a song and steal her heart
and there was i sitting in the very same coach with them
his lordship that was her husband sitting here her ladyship and what a ladyship sitting there
and here was i dressed as the marquis and what a marquis
the gondolier
fond passion s slave
will for his love each danger brave
winds and waves
both disdained
from his fair one s bright eyes
be a glance but his prize
it is still something
something gained
it is still
it is still
it is still something gained
it is still
it is still
it is still something gained
lovely lady this pearl grows yellow against the marble of your hand
well yellow or not it cost my husband 50 000 francs
no
and this medallion cost him 1 00 000
one hundred thousand francs
- what a waste of money
- sir
when even diamonds grow dull beneath the sparkle of your eyes
oh milord
but isn t your husband afraid to let his pretty wife travel with all these jewels
- oh why this isn t the half of them
- no
- just wait till you see
- what
i ll wager this is the richest fruitcake you ve ever seen
too rich milady too rich
why this road is overrun with the worst bandits in italy
oh they ll never find my jewels
nor my husband s 500 000 francs
francs
francs
who said 500 000 francs
i was just saying my love that you re far too clever for those nasty nasty bandits
i wish i were as clever with popinjays
and that s how i found milady s jewels
as a marquis i uphold tradition
you hold up the coach
tonio alessandro come with me
i want a word with you
drink for joy bestowing around around the wine is flowing
wine s the soldier s shield in the tented field
wine s the soldier s shield in the tented field ls there anything i can do to help you father dear

but father i love lorenzo and i m not afraid of poverty

- but father- -
- not another word

don t weep dear
what did your father have to say
- l ve got to marry francesco
- you don t have to marry anyone
- why don t you just flatly refuse
- you don t understand
it isn t that simple
father hasn t a lira and he s going to lose the inn
oh if i could only capture diavolo
but darling you ve been on his trail for months and he always slips away
yes but each time i ve been a little closer
and one of these days he ll not slip away

just a moment
- what d you do with our money
- l got it in the saddlebag
you d better give it to me
it ll be safer in my hands
our life savings
wouldn t it be terrible if we lost this
after all the years we have toiled and slaved for it
why we ve even gone without the necessities of life deprived ourselves of food actually starved
but now we have our reward
we can settle down for life and live on the fat of the land
keep your hands where they are
hand it over
there it goes
after all we went through to get it
oh well
come easy go easy that s my motto
what do you mean come easy go easy
now we ve got to start all over again right at the bottom
why don t we start at the top
- what do you mean
- well why don t we become bandits
then we wouldn t have to work hard anymore
let s get it the easy way
we could rob the rich and give them to the poor and we could have all- -
that s the first time that you ve shown any intelligence
well it s the first time you ve listened to me
you know if you d listen to me once in a while you d be a lot better off
i guess you re right
tell me that plan again
- all of it
- certainly certainly
well if- - lf we became rich and- -
and we robbed the poor and we gave them to the bandits and we could start at the top and we d get to the bottom without working hard anymore
we can t go wrong
it s the law of conversation
what do you mean
well as ye cast your bread on the waters so shall ye reap
- that s very well thought out
- l m glad you agree
you know there s one thing that s bothering me though
what s that
we don t know anything about being bandits
- l never- -
- why it s simple
we can be bandits
it doesn t require any brains
come on
your money or your life
your money or your life
your money or your life
what
your money or your life
we re a couple of bandits
we ve come to take your money
you wouldn t rob me
i can t afford to give you any money
i m a poor hard-working old man
the father of 1 6 children
it takes all i can earn to put bread in their poor little hungry mouths
i ve got a sick wife and grandma don t feel so well either
look at me
look at me
i got one foot in the grave
you wouldn t rob me and see my little ones go without
would you
