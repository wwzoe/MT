" C-Major Pentatonic Scale "
It 's too hard for me .
Fool !
But it 's better to learn the scale early .
Fool !
You stupid bird !
I 'll show you !
Don 't rush it , Koyuki-kun .
It 's only been two months since you started playing the guitar .
But he already knows the scale ...
C 'mon , we need a change of pace .

I was called to the faculty office .
S-see you ...
Hold it , Tanaka !
Yukio Tanaka of Grade 8B .
Please go to the faculty office immediately .
Listen , Tanaka-kun ...
I don 't think you 're taking your job as umbrella monitor seriously .
Huh ?
Oh , no ...
Daily life is a series of little jobs like this .
Maybe I should put this in your student report ...
I 'm disappointed in you , Tanaka-kun .
You may go .
Wait , Tanaka-kun !
What is this ?
What happened ?
It 's nothing .
We were kidding around and Tanabe-kun did a drop kick on me .
Tanaka-kun ...
And naturally , I gave it back to him with a heel hold ! So it 's no big deal !
Tanaka-kun ...
- Did you catch that game ? - Yeah !
That was awesome !
You look glum , Koyuki !
Maho !
Maho , you sure eat a lot .
Shut up . I 'm hungry .
You 'll gain weight .
You can have my fries .
Beck 's first live performance has been set !
R-really ?
How long is this going to continue ?
I 'll talk to him for you .
Okay ...
Okay , I 'm going on deliveries , so make up for being late and work extra hard .
I 'm sorry !
And don 't forget to feed Page .
I 'm off !
- He sure is strict .
Around strangers .
It 's okay , I 'll feed him .
- He 's ...
T-this is the last of it !
Oww ...
These aren 't company documents !
They 're Saito-san 's personal treasure !
Treasure ?
I mean , private collection .
Collection ?
Koyuki , how long have you been working here ?
- Since the end of summer break .
I want to repair the guitar Ryusuke-kun gave me .
I didn 't know ...
That 's why I don 't want to see Ryusuke-kun until the guitar is fixed .
Right . I understand .
So , how much do you get paid ?
Oh , umm ... 430 yen an hour .
Are you serious ?
That 's crazy !
This new law sure is bad for the manufacturing industry .
- Saito-sama , this way please .
Thank you for waiting . Rie-chan !
Thank you for calling her .
- Oh , it 's Ken-ken !
- Rie-rie !
- I missed you sooo much !
- Me too !
What 's with the get-up ?
Caught a cold or something ?
I 'm in disguise !
But how 'd you guess it was me ?
You stand out too much .
Okay , it 's starting !
Ryusuke-kun 's guitar ... Are those bullet marks ?
Yup .
They 're real .
Is that ...
That guitar has a name ... It 's Lucille .
- Sounds like a woman 's name .
- Yeah ...
It 's a guitar with a past ... Ryusuke got it in some dangerous place .
But ... It couldn 't possibly have happened while he was performing ?
One , two !
Typhoon 24 !
24-7 !
24 hours straight !
BECK !

Koyuki-kun ...
Can you go over to Hayakama Instruments ?
Huh ? !
There 's still more ? !
- The guitar 's fixed now .
The one with the broken neck .
I sent it out for repairs .
I-is that true ? !
You want to patch things up with Ryusuke , don 't you ?
Saito-san !
Now go , hurry !
Okay !
Koyuki-kun ...
Deduction for leaving early .
I think this 'll do .
If you notice something while playing it , just let me know .
Now I can see Ryusuke-kun !
Hey , Tanaka ...
Hey , Tanaka .
Lemme play that guitar .
What an awful sound ...
suits you perfectly !
Hey , Masaru .
What ?
Forget it , Rikiya-kun .
The sound is the pits .
You laughed just now , didn 't you ?
- Don 't act innocent !
No , I thought that tune was " Anarchy in Heaven " ...
Recently , the Sex Handles -
Damn thing !
Any complaints ?
Didn 't think so .
It was a piece of junk anyway .
Let 's go , Masaru !
Yeah .
- Let 's go grind someplace .
- How about New Burger ?
Did you get it , Koyuki-kun ?
Oh , good !
It 's all fixed , then ?
Actually , it 's been slow here at Saito Paper Company , so getting the money to fix it was a bit hard .
But it was worth it to see you smiling again !
Saito-san ...
Oh , you 're welcome !
Mom used to say , " From that day on , Yukio was like someone possessed by the guitar , and played it every single day . "
You were great at the concert !
Think so ?
I just looove your vocals , Chiba-kun !
We won 't miss your next live performance !
Then I 'll put you on the guest list ! Give me your names and numbers !
Hey , Ray !
I 've gotta talk to you !
Huh ?
What ?
What 're you mad about all of a sudden ?
Ryusuke-kun , you speak English !
That 's so cool ! Yeah .
I lived in New York for a long time . So I 'm more used to English than Japanese .
- That 's so cool ! - That 's so cool !
We 've got to go to New York , too !
- Tell us where you used to live !
- Yeah !
We wanna visit it !
- Sure .
- Yay ! Those idiots !
I was looking for the ab machine I bought by mail order last night ... and I finally found it !
Look !
This is it ...
The L48 Eddie gave to you !
Huh ? Then the one I gave to Koyuki was ...
That was a fake one you got at the guitar shop in Queens !
Which means ...
- Ryusuke-kun ! - Ryusuke-kun !
Don 't get tetanus !
Yukio !
Telephone !
Yukio !
Yukio !
I called Ryusuke too .
You 're joking , right ?
Oh , speak of the devil .
Sorry !
Maho ...
Did you really explain it to him ?
I did !
Idiot !
Why am I running away ?
Oh , Koyuki !
Izumi-chan !
I spoke to Ryusuke-kun on the phone yesterday and he said to say hi .
Oh ... Can you say hello from me , too ?
All 9th graders will report to the gym for curriculum guidance .
I repeat ...
- It 's almost graduation .
- Yeah ...
I 'll be lonely .
See you , Koyuki !
" Dear Koyuki-kun , "
" I 've decided to stay here a bit longer , so please take care of Page ! "
He 's extending his stay again !
Southeast Asia must have something that lures grown men ...
Fool !
I haven 't played yet !
Punk rockers hold their guitars low ...
Awright !
Yay !
Cripes !
I 'd better go to sleep !
" Kugatsu no Umi wa Darui Hito "
Look ...

Why 'd you run away the other day ?
Sorry !
Koyuki ! Let 's go up front !

This is no barrier , just what is important , nothing impure , just clear
No pressure at our pace

Foojin Takes me cruisin'
Music that cuts through the wind , free form
Bullet holes in the body ...
The acoustic pick-up in the front is broken .
He has a Roger Mayer at his feet .
But ... How is he getting such a sound ?
Wow ! Amazing !

So this is where Ryusuke-kun grew up ! Isn 't it cool !
Totally !
Huh ?
That dog ...

Ah , this is greasy .
I want to eat kimchee .
Is Chae Yoon 's coordinator in here ?
Excuse me , aren 't you Chae Yoon 's coordinator ?
Yes . Me ?
- Chae Yoon is done singing .
This lady right next to me ... everyone knows who she is right ?
She is my forever idol ... she is my rival whom I can never win against , she is the one who always makes me happy , and she is my mother .
Everyone should remember my mom as one of the greatest movie stars , but instead of becoming an actress , she wanted to become a singer just like me .
When I was stressed and exhausted , she 'd always sing me a song while having me on her lap .
Today , I would like to share that moment with everyone .
Watch out !
Watch Out !
No Moonhyuk .
No !
You cannot work yourself out .
You 're not normal .
In your head , there is still a bullet left .
Didn 't you hear it from the doctor ...
You 're back , are you ?
I knew you would be .
... I knew you would .
Go to Korea .
I packed your airplane ticket , some clothes and enough money to last you till you die .
Hurry up and go .
It 's this evening 's flight .
If you go home you 'll die .
Jason is trying to kill you .
That car a while ago was sent by Jason .
He burned all the pictures we 've taken together .
I 'm sorry that this is what I can do for you .
You saved our lives , but I can only do this for you and I 'm very sorry .
If he kills me , then I 'll die .
Even if you die , go die in Korea .
Don 't die here like a dog ,
Go to our country and die , Moonhyuk .
Am I dying ?
Oh poison !
You tasted this and died .
Oh careless love !
Why die and not a drop of poison left for me ?
Oh sword ...
My heart be the dagger 's sheath .
Let me to death !
Lead me to Romeo .
Let 's have you come out as an entertainer .
You might get nominated for an academic award .
When did you come ? I thought it would take about 30 minutes .
Hey sister ... I think it 's time for you to come out to the world .
Let 's go to the studio .
I 'll be your manager .
A customer came to buy a laundry machine and took a catalogue .
Stop fooling around and do a great job !
I 'm going .
How long will you keep suffering inside to be Yoon 's coordinator ?
I think you have the potential to be great .
I 'm not saying just because I 'm your sister . Well you might not be good as Kang Min Joo ... but you ...
I know myself more than you .
You do well .
Do you know how hard it was for me to get you employed here with the help of Yoon .
If you get fired ...
Yoon ?
Okay .
I 'll be there soon .
What did Yoon do now ?
Seriously there 's not a day where you can just relax .
I 'm going to go .
See you at home . - Okay , go . Go .
I also had an accident .
They told me to work only today and not come back from tomorrow . My swearing boss said .
He 's handsome .
If he were rich , how great that would be .
Ah , he 's handsome .
Cha Moonhyuk , it is true that you were adopted right ?
Yes .
You must not have memories of your mother or the country Korea .
I don 't remember anything .
I hope everyone forgives cha moonhyuk 's speaking .
He didn 't learn the proper speaking of Korean
I hope everyone understands him .
Yes , let 's bring Cha Moonhyuk on stage .
to find your family , is there any special things you can do or have anything that was given to you before you were adopted .
We 're on live right now .
This must be a remembered necklace .
So is this what you had when you were adopted ?
When and how did you get it ?
- Don 't know .
Can you please show it in front of the camera .
That necklace is pretty .
Where did I see that .
It doesn 't seem like a necklace from here .
Can you get out and ask the lady where she got that necklace ?
Can you ask ?
Yes , yes ma 'am .
Is that platinum or silver ?
Put it back on !
We have to keep watching so we can find you 're family .
No ... I 'm going to watch ' Janggoo ' .
Wait a second . Let me just watch a minute of it .
NO !
Mom !
I 'm going to watch ' janggoo ' . !
Turn in back to ' janggoo ' Kim Galchi !
After reading this , he disappeared during the rehearsal .
What are we going to do ?
Let me try to find him .
Wipe it with this .
Forget it .
When I meet my mother , I 'll ask her to wipe it for me .
A woman is is the way ...
Saeng . Saeng ni eh Sae .
You 're dumb , how can you not know how to read korean ?
Hey , where are you hitting my child ?
What a strange man .
Are you okay ?
Oh , saeng ni eh sae .
I love you .
The only thing I love is you .
You know right ?
What the heck is that ?
We 're in the middle of shooting can you please be quiet ?
Please help us .
Sorry .
what kind of person is this !
Can 't you see we 're shooting ?
Sorry !
I 'll try to solve the problem .
If you just go , I 'll hurry and solve the problem .
Open the door !
Yoon , please don 't do this .
Please ,
Please don 't do this . What are you going to do if reporters see this .
I don 't get it .
I seriously don 't understand that girl .
I 'm going nuts !
I 'm gonna die !
" Am I your servant ? "
" Do you want to die ? "
Studio ?
PD ?
Where ?
Chae Moonhyuk . Nice to meet you .
Let 's go .
No , I want to drink this .
- Mom , you order that one .
I ordered the Coke
No , I orderd the cola .
- After watching the show , that little boy gave us a call ..
He told us that his mother has the same exact looking necklace as yours .
It 's mine !
It 's because my mom had an accident along time ago .
At age seven , a grandpa told me that she got hit by a trunk infront of a church and hurt her head .
This ... read it .
Read what 's incribed in your ring .
Don 't know .
I don 't know .
Can 't your mother read ?
Is your mom stupid to read words ?
- She 's not stupid .
If she can 't read , how is she not stupid ?
It 's because she hasn 't learned all the alphabet . She can read up to gah , nah , dah , lah , mah , bah , sah .
Read what 's written .
For-ev-er ... ?
Forever ?
You can 't read words too ?
There are some words I can , and some words I can 't .
I 'm not stupid .
Compare to your mom , I 'm a 1000 times smarter !
Forver ... together ...
You do you know me ?
You ...
Who are you ?
Who are you ?
Suh Kyung .
Yoon
Suh Kyung .
Eunchae , let 's go home and make and eat spicy rice cake .
Ok ...
I 'm going to forget .
Minjoo
From this time , I 'll completely forget her .
Without any dusk , I 'm going to completely erase her .
Bye Kang Min Joo . It 's goodbye forever !
Don 't lie .
Grab a taxi and go home .
I want to say something to Minjoo .
I 'll say something and go .
So you go home first .
You have money for taxi , right ?
I do .
I 'm drinking soju and I 'll come back .
Want to wait for me ?
I 'll take a shot , come back , and do something about Minjoo
I 'll tell her not to make you sad and grab her hair and shake .
I 'll break her legs so that she can 't meet anyone .
Yah , it 's time for her to get beaten up .
Wait a second , I 'll be back .
- Don 't lay a hand on her .
It 's not Minjoo 's fault
She 's already warned me first .
I 'm the crazy one .
I 'll wait .
Finish him off and come back .
It 's also find if you come without finishing him .
I 'll finish it off for you .
You probably have to wait along time .
I started to date him just a week ago .
I can wait .
A month is enough right ?
- Chae Yoon .
You bastard !
Why hit him ?
Forever ..
Together ...
Forever
Together
There 's not a day when a grown up girl 's face isn 't ruined .
It 's scary to see a scab fall off !
I 'm alright , it doesn 't hurt .
Say you 're alright one more time , I 'm leaving you on the streets !
I say that I 'm alright because I 'm alright , and it doesn 't hurt because it doesn 't hurt .
Being alright ?
Not hurt ?
Are you made of metal ?
Are you a robot ?
Why 'd you come out from there ?
Are you 119 ? ( Police # )
It really doesn 't hurt .
Get out .
Fine , it hurts .
It hurts so much I can die .
I 'm not alright .
I 'll never be alright .
Not even after I die .
How sad .
So much I can die .
What can we do ...
Chae Moonhyuk and Yoon Suh Kyung , I went to the orphanage you guys went to .
You two were twins .
Tw-ins ?
The necklace was on you two the whole time .
That 's all I know .
Buy wrapped rice .
Buy wrapped rice .
- One please !
Wrapped rice !
How much ? - Two dollars .
Give me one .
- Yes .
Sir , this is a dollar .
Give me two .
Why do you always cheat ?
What do you mean cheat ?
You always cheat .
Why do you take my customers ?
Your customer , my customer ... they 're not the same .
Yours are yours , mine are mine .
And that 's that .
That 's not right !
How much is all this ?
Is that enough ?
Buy these , buy these .
I 'll give them to you half price .
Why is your mom sleeping that way ?
It 's because she wraps rice at night .
I 'll give you all these for 300 dollars .
I mean 200 dollars .
If you admit you cheated , I 'll buy everything here .
Ok , I did . I cheated .
If you cheat on the boy again , I won 't leave you alone .
Sukchae hurry and wake up .
The sun is up your butt hole you guys !
Wake up !
I thought it was settled for a while .
How did your eye become a black eye ?
I fell while I was walking .
It 's going to be alright after two days . It 's ok .
Instead of being Yoon 's coordinator , you following with gangsters ?
Samchae 's mom !
- She 's in the room .
You going to the groceries ?
Why are you wearing sunglasses inside the room ?
You do ssangkapeul surgery ?
Hurry and come out .
I have to take ma 'am to the studio shortly .
After I earn a lot of money , I 'm moving out of this house just to avoid hearing about her .
I 'm going grocery shopping with dad , so go up and peal onions .
Am I getting pregnant . I can 't smell onions .
Are there people coming to Yoon 's house ?
Yoon 's mother . She 's getting ready for " self camera "
She 's putting on a show off her famous son .
How arrogant .
Stop with the bad remarks .
Mom , you get botox ?
Okay .. mom the camera is rolling .
Don 't get nervous ... okay , 1 , 2 ...
Just like this , drinking coffee with my son is my joy and life .
Ah , let 's record again .
I seriously think this lipstick doesn 't fit me well .
Why ? It 's pretty .
I 'll be showing you my precious son .
Hello , I 'm Chae Yoon .
I heard my mom was doing a self camera , so ... I 'm just cutting in a little .
Mom , can I say something to you ?
What ? Say it .
Say it ...
Mother , go over there and sit .
You see , When I think about my mother , I 'm really thankful and shed tears .
Having me born to this world , Raising me up so perfectly ,
And always giving me so much love .
Mom , you are my sunshine and idol . You know that right ?
I love you , mom . I love you
You 're not supposed to act like that to an adult .
That lady is also a sad lady .
Later on , tell her that you 're sorry .
Say that you 're sorry , okay ?
- No .
Mister , are you a gangster ?
- Yes .
What is your name ?
- Galshi . ( Fish )
The same Galchi you cook with .
Is that your name ?
- Yes .
What grade are you in ?
- I don 't go to school .
Even though I don 't go to school , I can read korean . Speak a little english .
I 'm pretty smart .
- What about your father ?
I don 't have those .
Hey grandpa !
- Oh hey .
Let 's each Samkyupsal .
This is the guy I met .
The guy who has the necklace . The guy who is from Australia .
Your eyes take after your mom 's eyes , a lot .
Quite similar .
Have you ate samkyupsal before ?
How about soju ?
Lay your sister down and come here .
I 'll teach you how to eat samkyupsal and drink soju .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry , Eunchae
If no guys come to you because your face is full of injuries ... And if they don 't like you , and no one takes you , Then just come to me .
I 'll live with you .
Come to me .
For real , I 'll take care of you .
What 's wrong ?
Water !
Water !
What 's wrong , Song Eun-chae ?
Oh it 's nothing ...
I 'm alright .
Why aren 't you picking it up ?
It 's Minjoo .
How do I look ?
Am I pretty ?
You 're pretty .
How about you , Eunchae ? Am I pretty ?
Yes , you 're beautiful .
What kind of earring will match with this kind of clothes ?
Diamond ?
Ruby ?
Saphire ?
It 's better than bacon right ?
It 's because you have korean taste .
Do you ... know my mother ?
Does she live in this neighborhood ? My mother ?
- No ...
Why would you mom live in a crappy neighborhood like this ?
... very smart .
How 'd she get like you ...
My mother ...
Help me meet her .
I 'll let you meet her .
It 's time for you to meet her .
You .. are all quite smart .
How 'd you learn the language so well ?
You said this was better than bacon , so eat .
I don 't really like this necklace .
Thiis necklace and this dress don 't match , right ?
They are pretty , why ?
Fake stuff is obvious .
Wouldn 't the dress look fake too ?
Didn 't you buy that necklace very expensive ?
- Not expensive . 1000 dollars .
A thousand ...
Is as much as my daughter 's tuition .
Just wear it .
You look quite glamorous , so it 's okay .
Is that so ?
Let 's leave , ma 'am .
To get to the studio , we 're already late .
Let 's go .
Are you a stalker ?
Mom , Sook-chae is trying to hit me .
Hurry and raise your hands !
Nobody does these kind of things anymore . Look at my age .
How old are you ? A 28 ( ?
) yo with nothing better things to do so she steals a guy 's clothing .
- Like I said .
If Yoon 's mom finds out , we 'll all get kicked out of this house !
Yoon is a star ... a star !
And these ... these are not Yoon 's . These can be considered to be from Yoon 's fans .
How much is this ?
How much do you get exactly ?
- You gonna buy it ?
Each one is 30 dollars ... with a discount I can give it to you for 150 dollars .
What the ... just those are 30 dollars each ?
The hankercheif Yoon used to wipe his sweat at his concert . That sold for 50 dollars .
50 dollars ?
- They put these in auctions .
Things used by Elvis Presley ... those are worth big money !
Unbelievable ...
At the house ... there are many hankerchiefs Yoon 's used to wipe his face and sweat .
Then ... we shouldn 't washed them , right ?
- Exactly . So bring them to me .
So bring that and I 'll cut you in .
How much would bowls and dishes sell for ?
If we consider some things ... About 1000 dollars .
Call the police , Minchae !
Tell them to take these two away .
Song Eun Chae !
- Are you calling ?
I finished him off .
Sooner than you expected , huh ?
You 've become so pale .
Aren 't you going to take me ?
You taking me ?
Sorry ... for confusing you .
I 'm making ... Chachang ramen . You want some ?
Let 's go .
Who it it ?
Let me use the restroom .
But who is it ?

Let me use the restroom .
This isn 't a public restroom .
I 'm going to piss my pants .
Let me use it !
- Piss yourself .
Am I stopping you ?
What a psycho !

Is it a hella rich house ?
But hey !

So is he saying that he 's a dog ? Wha ?
That 's right .

If you don 't want to die .
Jason sent you here .
Jason sent you here to kill me !
Did you think I 'll get tricked ?
Do you really think I was going to get tricked by you old man !
How can that lady be my mom ?
how can that lady be my mom !
She is your mother !
- Don 't lie !
If she lives so great , why would she abondon me ?
With that money , she can buy all the milk in the world and raise 1000 children !
It 's not like it was hard to live or even starve to death .
How , not one but two why would she abandon me !
Your mom is that kind of lady .
Anything that gets in her way , children or else ?
She 's capable of that .
Your mom does whatever she wishes .
Shut your mouth .
I 'm going to kill you .
I 'm going to you old man !
Why , did your mom cause an accident again ?
I don 't want to be the mom ?
i want to die . Why ?
Is she in another accident ?
Then , did he come to find me all the way from Australia ?
But how 'd he know where I live ?
Is he a wacko ?
Oh , Yoo !
Pork ?
I 'm going to put it in the jajang sauce .
It 's not in your fridge ?
Would you buy some ?
Yah , with side skins
Sure , thanks !
I 'm an excellent cook .
Tangsooyook , Palboochae , Galbijim , shinsunyoo , pasta .
I also clean and do laundry extremely well .
There 's nothing I can 't do well
Later , I probably can raise babies well .
I won 't let your hands touch water .
Well , we have to go there and see ? but I 'll be a good match for a husband .
Do you like me that much ?
Of course
Ah ! You 're in big trouble Chae Yoon
Have you no idea what you want in a women ?
Don 't make me sad anymore .
Make me sad again , and I 'll really die then .
I 'll wait by your house . I 'll wait till you come out .
Sorry .
Pork ...
Did he tell me to buy front leg ?
Or back leg ?
Or was it side skins ?
Rock head rock head !
I should die !
You know how much I worked to get that shirt ?
These girls need to be in jail and eat bean rice to wake them up .
Is seems like she didn 't know .
Why don 't you forgive her .
I mean why make a big deal with just one shirt .
- Just one shirt ?
With just this one shirt , I can feed 5 people in my family .
Nowadays we don 't have much customers and we 're about to starve to death .
Why did you steal it ?
Didn 't Galchi teach you that it 's bad to steal clothes ?
I gave money .
- You did ?
Sure , if you pays ... then I 'll ...
That doesn 't make sense .
Are you fallen for her or something ?
All the guys in my family and neighborhood have been drooling over her ...
If you don 't put her in jail , I 'll going to bring my lawyer !
Why are you crying for ?
Huh , why are you crying for .
( she gives narration )
With that brings the end of program ...
Thank you .
Oh you 're too kind !
When I look at it we can 't praise you enough !
This is too much !
Excuse . Let 's talk for a minute
Couple days ago , there was a morning special adoption show right ?
- Yes , there was . Oh , they must be twins .
How cute .
Sorry I contact you again .
I 'm sorry but can I hold your baby ?
Can I feed him for some milk too ?
... I 'll give you milk .
Don 't wanna ?
Your twins are too cute .
I want to raise twins too .
The mother must feel so happy
It hurts ...
More gently !
Wake up !
The sun is up , you guys !
Hamchae !
Aigoo , how disgusting .
If I could put you back into my stomache !
Sookchae wake up .
Where 's Eunchae ?
Would she fit beneath the bed , mom ?
She 's with Yoon to help him out .
You little !
You 'd hit your own mother ?
- That 's what I 'm sayin !
Sorry !
I think that girl with thick lips recognizes you .
She probably thinks I just look similar .
Ah , eat .
In the whole world , eating eggs in the Hot Room is the best .
You should have gone somewhere else ... why on a Sunday ?
If we get caught , we 'll die .
- Just eat it .
You find it well .
- So this is how Hot Room looks like .
This is fun .
- Right ?
Hey , not you too !
Don 't you know the danger of another scandal broke loose ?
- I got it .
I 'll be careful .
I don 't have make up on , they won 't recognize me .
Fruit ice cream is killer here .
- We should come here all the time .
What should we do ?
I 'll cause a distraction , so sneak away , ok ?
Why are you crying ?
Why are you crying , Miss ?
Grandmother !
What am I going to do ?
What 's the matter ?
Did someone hit you ?
- No ...
My butt was burning ...
Sauna 's really hot , grandma
How embarassing .
Yoon
Where are you ?
- Olympic parkway .
Olympic parkway ?
I 'll drive Minjoo home and come back .
Hey , you 're bleeding !
Does it sting ?
It stings , huh ?
Oh , Minjoo fell and scratched her knee .
You should be careful .
It 's ok .
I can take the bus .
You look normal , but how sad .
Here .
Thank you
- Let 's go , mother .
What would her parents feel ?
Did you eat ?
You didn 't eat , did you ?
You don 't look like you did .
Did you like me that much ?
Even if you like me that much ... All the way from Australia ... Why would you come all this way ?
Do you know someone who lives here ?
You don 't even know anyone and yet you still came for me ?
It doesn 't seem like we talked to each other that much .
But I 'm not someone that anyone would like at first sight .
In anycase , thank you for liking a girl like me .
We don 't have much food , but do you want to eat at my house ?
Let 's go .
I can 't give you my heart , but I can give you food .
Sorry ...
Let 's go ...
This is Yoon 's house and our house is over here .
Hey , but our house is this way ...
Hey , not there !
This isn 't our house ...
We 'll be in trouble if the lady comes out .
Hurry , let 's leave ...
She probably has her reasons ...
Who can abandon their own flesh and blood ?
Things can happen , right ? People live in poverty , But I hope she 's living well !
Your eyes take after your mother 's ...
And you 're all very smart !
I 'll make a lot of money , and go back to Korea .
Meet my poor mother , buy her pretty clothes , some kalbi meat , and a gorgeous house .
Just wait , mom !
I 'll go there and place you in riches .
Just wait five years !
Oh , how sad ...
Ma 'am
- Oh , Eunchae , you 're here ?
You were home ?
Stella is so tragic .
- Stella ?
Stella from ' Last Concert ?
Have you never watched it ?
Stella is a sad girl who comes out in the movie ,
She has leukemia and , later , dies in front of her lover .
How can her life be like that ?
Who mother dies ... Her father has an affair and flees with his lover ...
And then to abandone Richard who she loved .
How hard it must be not to die ...
Take it easy , ma 'am .
It 's just a movie .
- It 's just a movie , but my heart 's aching !
I 've watched it five times and everytime my heart hurts .
Son , my son !
Don 't you want to cheer me up ?
Go shopping with me .
It 's not Yoon ...
Who is that man ?
Someone I sort of know ...
He came into the wrong house .
What 's with him ?
Why is that man crying ?
I did something wrong .
He must be hurt because of me .
But why did he look at me that way ?
I 'm sorry
Even though I appreciate it , I already have someone I like ... There 's no room for you ...
Eat this !
Hey , Galchi , eat .
I told you I 'm not speaking with you anymore !
I 'm sorry ...
Talk with me , hmm ?
Going off stealing things Mom , I 'm so embarrassed to death because of you .
It 's so annoying !
I won 't do it again .
I won 't .
You always say that !
Are you stupid ?
Didn 't you know your mom was stupid ?
If she doesn 't know , you can just keep telling her .
You can teach her !
Hold your spoon !
You know I 'm a gangster , right ?
Do you want to get hit or do you want to eat ?
Eat !
Drink water ...
Drink it !
Even though your mom lives her life like that Even though she 's an idiot , She doesn 't throw away her children .
It 's me ...
Danny ...
How are you ?
Is Korea good ?
Yeah , thanks to you .
I checked into a really nice hotel with the money you gave me .
You 're right .
It 's a lot of money ... Enough to last me a lifetime .
Thank you .
Why aren 't you speaking in Korean ?
Is there something wrong ?
I call because I wanted to ask you something .
How long did the doctor say I have to live ?
I heard that I was dying but I didn 't find out how much time I have left ...
Do I have at least ... A year ?
Not even ... A year ?
Son , my son !
Won 't you come and cheer me up ?
- Who is that man ?
It 's your first time seeing me dance , huh ?
How was it ?
The pd says it 's corny .
You think it 's corny too ?
It 's corny ?
I 'm not broadcasting ... I 'm going home .
Hey , what 's wrong ?
Is it really corny ?
Did I say that ?
- Yes .
- When ?
- Right now !
It 's not that really cool .
It kills !
You really said it was corny .
- I didn 't !
Is it really good ?
- Yes .
When other people say something , you act as if nothing happened but when I say something .. you act as if your life has ended .
Am I the only one to be pick on ?
Am I some kind of passing dog ?
Not a dog , but a god .
You 're my god .
Did you not know that ?
If you like it , it 's good no matter .
If you don 't like it , I break down .
I am to die for , right ?
How did you get here ?
- I have a shooting close by here .
It 's a short break and I heard Yoon 's song .
I wanted to see him .
You should have called .
Where are you shooting ?
- Close by here .
When are you singing ?
- In a little while .
When I think of my mother , I 'm grateful and I start to cry .
For giving birth to me , and raising me up so well .
I love you .
Why are you here ?
To see Yoon .
Let 's go .
But there still time till the shooting .
Let go .
Why are you doing this ?
Stand right there , Jo Yongho !
Let go of her hand .
- Go back and do your dance .
You can 't let go ?
Minjoo is my girl .
Let go of her hand .
You starting a fight ?
- I told you to let go .
Fine .
Let 's end it today .
Say it now .
Me or Chae Yoon ?
Me or Chae Yoon ?
Can you both let go of my wrists ?
On tomorrow 's sports news page , it 's going to be our headline .
My dad is going to explode again .
- Didn 't you break up with him ?
- I did .
I did but I don 't think he can .
You , do you want to see me die today ?
Are you two debating ?
Always saying you 're going to die .
Its getting so old .
Do you guys die because of a woman ?
Do you die because of a person ?
How tedious .
I should stop playing with kids .
I 'm sorry but I don 't believe in love .
Especially guys like you who always talk about love ?
I don 't believe in it more .
You said that if I died , you 'd come along with me .
Chaeyoon didn 't you say you loved me more than yourself ?
Is that true ?
Would that really be true ?
Would a love like that .. Exist really ?
Yoon can 't swim !
He can 't swim !
What about Minjoo ?
Don 't worry .
She 's fine .
Stay still !
Would you like to wait a bit ?
I 'll bring Yoon 's clothes , wanna wear that ?
Wait !
You 'll catch cold like that .
You don 't listen !
Mister !
Wake up !
What 'd you do all that time Not knowing how to swim .
It seem like you like that girl .
You must been embarrassed a bit .
Are you the person who saved us ?
- Maybe ...
Thanks , bro .
You don 't have a brother , right ?
Yes .
Want me to be your brother ?
Want to be my little brother ?
- We 'll see .
Don 't want it ?
Then don 't do it .
Brother ... . I 'll do it .

Sis !
What 's the problem ?
What 's wrong that is making your face fired up ?
Did you fart in front of Yoon ?
Hurry up and stop farting !
I need to pee too ! - Go to Yoon 's .
What is it ?
What should I do , Minchae ?
- Are you constipated too ?
There is a guy who came from Australia to see me .
I met him when I followed Yoon to shoot his CF .
I got helped a lot .
- You have a boyfriend ?
Not me , just that person .
Not you , him ? - Yeah .
It seems he 's fallen for me .
I feel so sorry , what I should I do ?
He 's fallen for you ... so you 're saying he 's come all the way from Australia for you .
Did you sleep with him ?
Did you ?
Yes .
I was freezing to death so we held each other .
I think that 's when he started to fall for me .
You must be crazy !
- That 's what I 'm sayin .
How could you ?
The world 's gonna end .
No .
It 's not that .
Oh , how disgusting .
For how long have you guys been in here ?
Sookchae , aren 't you done ?
Eunchae , Minchae ... aren 't you done washing up ?
- We are done .
We 'll be out soon .
Then come out .
Your father has to use the bathroom too !
Mom !
- What ?
Eunchae said she slept with a guy .
We must prepare a gift . No !
We did sleep but not in that way !
I haven 't even kissed with a guy .
Now I 'm seeing things .
I feel so sorry .
Eunchae !
- Going somewhere ?
To see my brother .
- Brother ?
Oh good ... eat this .
- What is this ?
Mountain Ginseng .
Added some honey on the mountain ginseng or something like that .
Eat it .
How can I eat this fragile thing ?
- Because it is , you should eat it .
I don 't want to .
Your mother bought it for you .
Hey ,
I can 't eat this .
How could I ?
You eat it .
Then I 'm throwing it away .
Why can 't you eat this ? My mouth is my mouth . Is your mouth dirty then ?
Yoon ...
Give it so I can give it to a dog .
- Hey , Ok ! I 'll eat it .
Ok now ?
- Yes .
My mom says she feels great when feeding me delicious food .
I feel great when I do the same for you .
Probably in the past , I might have been your mom or dad .
Eat well and grow a lot , ok ?
- Son !
Yes ?
- Yoon , put this on and go .
What is that ?
- This is milk oil .
It 's great for dark circles .
- Who has dark circles ?
So we have to prepare for it beforehand .
I feel like dying when I see your handsome face get dirty .
Eunchae , so what happened with that guy ?
Guy ?
- Sure .
Eunchae 's got a boyfriend .
She has a boyfriend ?
Eunchae ?
Who is it ?
What does he do ?
- He must be sensitive .
He was even crying .
Eunchae , do a good job .
If you make someone else cry , Then your eyes will cry blood .
Good luck , Eunchae .
Congratulations , you wicked girl !
What the heck kind of guy is he ?
Eunchae has no sense for understanding guys .
Why am I feeling upset ?
Get in !
Water tastes great , doesn 't it ?
I had a cramp .
I almost died .
You can 't reveal your fear to God ...
You have to crush it first .
That 's the only way you make friends with him
When 'd you learn how to swim ?
I didn 't learn .
You weren 't taught ?
But I haven 't learned either .
Then what do I do to become as good as you ?
Try your best !
- Then I guess I should come here more often .
But I don 't swim !
When I think of my mother , I feel grateful and I start to cry ,
She gave birth to me , and raised me well .
And giving me so much love .
Mom , you are my sunshine and idol .
How is it ?
- It 's good .
But this place ... it seems ...
Look over here .
Stripes look great on Yoon .
This is the fifth , ma 'am .
- Oh yeah ?
This style wouldn 't work on anyone but Yoon , right ?
But , ma 'am , this please is extremely expensive .
Red is great on my son as well .
One second ...
Having a great son it hard work too , sis .
Yes ,
Yoon ?
You can 't reach him ?
He said he was going to meet up with his " brother " .
I don 't know what he was talking about .
Newspapers ?
No , I didn 't see them .
What ?
" Kang Minjoo 's fling with Chae Yoon "
" Kang Minjoo reveals all : Love 's a just a game to me , I was only playing "
I have to go somewhere .
I 'll see you later .
To drive like that ?
Would your head crack like that ?
Want a hammer ?
Today I 'm gonna die .
And so will she .
No one better stop me .
Come in , Eunchae !
Door 's open !
Wait , just one more round ...
Isn 't this too much ?
Go explain yourself to Yoon .
It seems the interview is out ...
You wanna die ?
You wanna get beat ?
You have any idea how much Yoon loved you ?
Yoon , the guy you cheated on .
Sorry .
But I can 't change who I am .
You know I 'm a flirt by nature .
Why do you live this way ?
Is this the way you want to live ?
Why do you live so recklessly ?
Want to end your career ? Are you a rock head ?
Are you an idiot ?
Have you decided to end it all ?
You idiot , you dummy , you moron !
You done hitting me ?
Is that all the power you got ?
At least you should break a rib or something .
Yoon ... I think I like him .
I think because of that ...
Maybe because I was really starting to like him ... That 's why I did it .
What ?
You like Yoon , don 't you ?
I 'm a romance scholar .
You think I wouldn 't know ?
I knew since a long time ago .
Who 's heard of a friendship between a guy and girl ?
What is this girl talking about ?
Do you really want to be beat today ?
Still I wanted to go all the way , but I couldn 't because of you .
You have him .
You can have him .
That 's right .
You should be beat !
You need a beating to get you back to your senses .
I 'm going to beat you to a pulp !
You 're dead , Kang Minjoo !
Can 't you stop that , Eunchae ?
What do you think you 're doing ?
What gives you the right to hit her ?
No one lays a finger on her !
Yoon !
Mind your business from now on .
Don 't meddle in ours , Eunchae .
Don 't overreact .
You got it ?
Go out !
Didn 't you hear me ?
Get the hell out !
I 'm still owe you one .
Don 't get hit again ,
.. from me or Eunchae .
If someone does this again , I 'm going to kill em .
Be it Eunchae , or me .
I 'll kill them all .
Don 't do that again .
You 'll die too .
And I 'll die .
I 'm sorry .
I was wrong .
I won 't be that way again .
I 'm sorry .
Poor baby .
Are you lost ?
Don 't cry .
Don 't cry , ok ?
I 'll find your mother for you .
Crying is bad .
Santa Clause doesn 't give presents to children who cry .
So don 't cry .
Hello ?
This is Perry 's mother , right ?
Hi , I 'm Song Eunchae ...
What 's the capitol of Australia ?
Don 't you even know the capital of your own country ?
Canberra .
Isn 't it Sydney ?
- Canberra .
Was it changed ?
What about our country ?
Seoul .
So you 're not demented .
Then ok .
Let 's go out .
Are you embarrassed ?
Is looking at my face difficult for you ?
You 're introverted , I see .
I didn 't think so .
Try some of mine .
This is what couples do when they go out .
It 's called being affectionate .
You 're ashamed .
You 're so cute .
- Please be quiet .
I 'll be asleep for 5 minutes , so please .. be quiet .
Are you ok ?
Hey !
Wake up !
Get it together !
Have some .
- It 's ok . You eat it .
Eat !
- I don 't eat eaten food .
But Eunchae does .
She has the stomach for that .
Am I a stranger ?
- Sorry .
That 's my personality .
I don 't eat from my mother 's leftovers either .
Where you going ?
- Bathroom .
Do you get home safe , Eunchae ?
About before ...
I was out of line .
You 're not upset , are you ?
Actually , I didn 't mean to offend you .
Why isn 't she saying anything ?
Hello ?
Isn 't this Song Eunchae 's cell phone ?
- The owner has fainted .
Her dad says he 's coming now .
Where is over there ?
Sir , sir !
Please wake up .
Are you ok ?
They won 't even budge .
Pardon me !
Excuse me .
They fainted while kissing .
Eunchae !
She 's like this when she 's drunk .
I can 't pull them apart .
What happened ?
These two ... were drinking and then they kissed and ...
Get it together !
Help me lift her .
What happened ?
How did Moohyuk and Eunchae end up together ?
Is he someone you know ?
Yes .
- How do you know him ?
He 's just a guy I like .
What does he do ?
I 'm not sure either .
Yoon !
- Yes ?
What exactly does Eunchae like ?
Chicken , rice ...
- What doesn 't she like ?
Ghosts , orangutans , hospitals ..
Why do you ask ?
Because I 'm her father ... Yet I don 't know a lot about her .
You 've spent more time with her than me , right ?
Yes .
You 'll probably know her more than I do .
Right ?
Is Eunchae ...
Is Eunchae promiscuous ?
What ?
Let go .
You 're so strange .
Just leave it .
I 'll fold it up later .
What ?
Did you piss the bed ?
Minchae , conference time !
- What ?
What secret is this now ?
I 'm late for school .
Yesterday , who brought me home ?
- Dad did .
Mom 's having a fit because of you so run like hell when you see her .
You ... would you look at my lips ...
What about them ?
How is it ?
Does it look they 've been kissed ?
I 'm not sure if it was a dream or not ...
It doesn 't seem like it was a dream ...
Look at them .
Do they look like they 've been kissed ?
What do kissed lips look like anyway ?
- I wouldn 't know .
Since I never kissed anyone .
- What did you do yesterday ?
Well , exactly ... .
But you 've read a lot of weird books , so wouldn 't you know ?
I wouldn 't know either ...
Want me to get the magnifying glass ?
Your lips seem bruised and swollen .
Push them out more .
In my estimation , you were kissed .
They say the body remembers what your brain doesn 't .
Kiss that guy again .
What ?
Kiss .
- You crazy ?
Whatever .
Forget it !
Sister !
I 'm not liking these dishes .
Where might the Italian china be ?
Don 't move a step !
Who are you ?
- You 're hurt , stay still !
Aren 't you Eunchae 's boyfriend ?
But why are you here ?
Where 's the medicine ?
Yoon !
Where 's the medicine !
Son !
Yoon is asleep !
Where 's the medicine !
What 's going on ?
Who is that man ?
- Who ?
Ah , that 's Moohyuk .
- Why is he at our house .
I brought him over last night .
He was too drunk .
- I told you not to bring just anyone in !
But he was drunk and we didn 't where he lives .
You don 't even know where he lives , you don 't even know him well .
Are you common man ?
You 're in show business .
Quiet . He 'll hear us .
- Who do you take after that you can act this way ?
Since you 're my mother , probably after you .
I got to take a leak , I 'll be back .
That guy scares me .
Tell him to leave , please .
- What 's scary about him ?
He won 't eat you .
I 'm going to wash , so just stay around .
Hey !
Then I 'll go with you to the bathroom .
Were you hurt ?
- Yeah , I was hurt a lot , I 'm bleeding .
I can 't live . ...
Put some medicine on it .
Let me borrow this for a while .
Am I a joke to you ?
If you show up again ... and you 're dead !
Will she be ok ?
- She 'll be fine .
It was a good thing to stop her bleeding .
Buy some kimbop !
Buy some dukkbogi !
Have you sold a lot ?
It 's blood !
You should go the hospital .
Why ... did you tell me ?
My mother ...
Why did you tell me about her ?
What would I do about it ?
What would I do about it , old man !
Do whatever you want .
Whatever you want .
All done .
Go to the hospital .
My mother ...
That lady ...
Did she wrong you too ?
Yes .
Galchi , let 's have dinner together tonight .
Let 's make jorim .
Kang Minjoo has avowed her relationship with Chae Yoon today .
I 've worked hard the past 3 years
With her alone I can give up everything else in the world .
Without her , I don 't feel alive .
What are your feelings toward Chae Yoon ?
Chae Yoon is the nicest and most honest man I know .
I 've done him a lot of wrong , But I 'm determined to make it up to him .
I didn 't think love was real , But through Yoon , I 've come to believe .
He 's scary , just tell him to leave .
Do whatever you want .
Both of them have opened their hearts and the public agrees they match well .
They 're rising in popularity .
Due to today 's conference , the issue is getting hot .
Live happily , Yoon !
If you hurt him , I won 't leave you alone , Minjoo !
Be happy together !
I 've got to go to the studio , I don 't think drive you .
- It 's ok .
That 's why I brought my car .
I 'll call you .
Get home safe .
How can I help you ?
Hey !
- Lady .
Get out !
Lady ?

subtitles by zdoon
Who are you ?
Can 't you recognize your mother and sister ?
Why are you guys staring at me ?
Is there something on my face ?
- There is .
No joking , lots of stuff on your face .
Ah alright , alright !
I already made a promise . Today at five , at the Seoul Hotel first floor coffee shop ... a guy ... About 26 yo ...
Your " date " ...
( for marriage )
I 'm set up for a " marriage interview " , mom ?
Alright alright .
If this date gets cancelled , I 'm going to dig a hole and bury myself . - It 's not a threat .
Mom looked at a coffin a while ago .
I looked at a blackish copper coffin .
- Give it up , mom . If Eunchae goes on this date then I 'll immediately go into Seoul University .
Well yeah . If Eunchae goes ...
then I 'll give you this bed , mom .
Yah yah ...
If she goes on this date ... you be the mother .
I 'll go on the date .
With news as good as that , you should have told me sooner .
If that person is wonderful , can I propose to him first , mom ?
Do you not like me ?
It 's not that I don 't like you .
You 're just not my type .
What is your type ?
It 's hard for me to say ...
Do you want to draw your type then ?
Ten minutes haven 't even passed . How can you tell if I 'm your type or not ?
If you look at me close enough ...
I might be your type . - I can tell in one minute .
How do you figure that in a minute , huh ?
Nonsense .
It doesn 't make sense .
- Why not ? It doesn 't
- It does !
Tell me the truth .
What exactly don 't you like about me ?
How can I ... .. tell you that ?
Tell me .
It 's alright .
Since you 're asking ... I really don 't like your appearance .
What about my appearance ?
Take a look in the mirror .
We 'll pay the coffee bills separately , okay ?
I have to get to the broadcast station fast so I don 't think I can take you home .
It 's okay .
That 's why I brought my car too .
I 'll call you .
Get home safely .
How can I help you ?
Hey !
- Lady !
Get out .
Lady ?
- You ...
Where do you put your eyes when driving ?
Look here , guy .
- Lady , my baby is .. ... stuck beneath your car .
Take your car out now .
Didn 't you hear me ?
- I didn 't know .
When I was parking , I didn 't feel a thing .
I didn 't know .
Take the car out .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm really sorry .
I 'll pay you .
If this isn 't enough , leave me with your number .
You know who I am right ?
I 'm Kang Minj ...
What is this ?
What do you think you 're doing ?
Are you trying to toy with me ?
But , you picked the wrong person , man .
I 'm Kang Minjoo !
Shut your mouth and pull your car out .
Leave my site by one minute , lady !
Chae Yoon !
- Oh hyung ,
Where were you ?
- Where are you ?
Broadcasting station .
Wanna come over ?
Am I officially your manager from today ?
- Yeah , the official work starts from tomorrow .
Wait for ten minutes .
I just got in a taxi ... I 'll be there soon .
What a sad doggy dog .
I 'll wash you up clean .
So you 're not crazy .
Fine then .
Let 's date .
Do I look like a pushover to you ?
You , if you appear before me again ...
You 'll die then .
Why is that sound coming all the way through here .
Sangchae , wake up !
There is a picture shoot today , right ?
Yoon .
Son .
Wake up and wash and then let 's get to the picture shoot .
Not waking up ?
Get up , get up !
Go out with your son , why don 't you ?
Disgusting !
I may have given birth to you but you guys are pathetic !
Today ... Fire !
Fire !
Sonchae !
Fire !
Stop playing !
Are you up ?
For a while now .
Then why pretend to be asleep ?
Just because . I didn 't want to open my eyes so I just lazily stayed put .
Yoon and his mother Today there going to have a photo shoot .
Are you sick ?
Look at the sweat .
You even have a fever !
I 'm a little sick I guess .
Do you think you can go ?
I mean , what 's going on with you ?
It 's ok . I 'll be fine .
Hello doggy dog .
Sleep well ?
Did you sleep well ?
- Yes . Good morning .
Wake up Yoon .
I can 't do a thing to wake him up .
- He 's still sleeping ?
Yeah , he went to sleep at dawn .
He said he dreamed of a ghost .
He even came into my room and slept with me .
Don 't tell Minjoo about Yoon being this way .
- Being what way ? Like not being able to sleep after a scary dream , like how he 's afraid of ghosts at his age .
Sure .
I wouldn 't tell her .
Yoon , wake up !
You have a shoot to go to .
Wake up , it 's late .
People are waiting for you .
Are you going to cancel ?
I 'm going to cancel .
Wake up .
Oh , good boy !
I 'm not good !
You know about the Kong Kong Ghost right ?
The ghost who died falling down from a three story building ?
The ghost who walks on its head like ... kong kong kong .
The kong kong ghost is searching for the person who pushed her to her death .
Pusher 's name is Chae Yoon .
Kong kong kong .
Just now , it opens the door and enters .
Kong kong kong .
It 's gotten into the living room ...
Kong kong kong .
It crawls up the stairs ...
Has it reached Yoon 's room ?
He 's not in here ...
Kong kong kong .
Then after that , it goes back downstairs ...
Kong kong kong .
Finds out that Yoon is in his mom 's room .
There is something laying down by your side .
Sleep well with the kong kong ghost .
Why don 't you get off of me and go .
Get off .
- Don 't want to .
Hey , am I your wife ?
Am I your mother ?
It feels gross .
What did you just say ?
Yes , you are .
That makes me depressed , Eunchae !
Really depressed .
I 'm not going to the shoot today .
- Go or don 't go .
Is she on drugs ?
I should emigrate .
Go and live away for ten years and come back .
Am I really that sick ?
Concentrate , Eunchae !
Concentrate .
Why did you poke me ?
Hey , it is you .
- Why poke me ?
I thought I was hallucinating ...
and wanted to check ...
Do you like me too ?
- No !
They why poke a man standing still ?
You do you like me , right ?
So that 's why you poked me ?
No !
Your face isn 't looking well . You sick somewhere ?
- No .
You look sick .
- No .
Your face is pale .
- No !
Is no the only thing you can say ?
You hate me ?
- No ...
Am I a joke to you ?
Do I look like a pushover ?
If you show up even once more ... then you 'll really be dead !
Hey !
I warned you , didn 't I ?
That if you showed up again , I 'd kill you ?
I do what I say .
If I say I 'll kill you , I do it .
Kill me .
Kill me .
You are crazy , huh ?
Yeah .
- Are you schizo ?
Go .
Just go .
Go back to your country .
Go back to Australia .
Go , I said go .
I don 't like you .
You 're seriously not my type .
I don 't even like thinking about guys like you , so leave .
Leave , please !
What are you doing , Eunchae ?
Who are you to tell my bro to go or not ?
Sleep well ?
You sleep well too , bro ?
When 'd you get here ?
- 1 hour .
- I have a photo shoot with my mom today .
Let 's leave together when she comes out .
Sure .
This man ... the new manager is this man ?
- That 's right , why ? Are you nuts ?
Are you crazy ?
How can you hire a dude like this ?
How can you talk like that ?
A dude like him ? He 's older than you are .
Are you on drugs today ?
From this point on , I 'm not you 're coordinator .
Sorry , sorry , sorry .
We 're late because of me , right ? Mom , Eunchae says she won 't be my coordinator from today .
Why ?
- Don 't know .
She says I should hire someone else .
- Why , Eunchae ? Did Yoon do something wrong again ?
How could he hire anyone else ?
Except for you , no one can handle Yoon .
It 's not that .
- Our Yoon ... I 'll scorn him later .
Lets go right now , we 're late .
You ?
He 's my manager since yesterday , mom .
It must be ' that day ' for Eunchae .
She 's weird .
She says I 'm disgusting .
And a while ago , she swore at Moohyuk .
She 's random , that girl .
- She is a grown-up woman ... don 't call her girl .
That person , Eunchae did you get him to work ?
No . No , ma 'am .
Isn 't he your boyfriend , Eunchae ?
No , nothing like that .
Later ... if you ask me who I 'd choose between Moohyuk and you ,
I 'd choose Moohyuk !
Got that !
Why ? Because Moohyuk is cool !
He 's not a snob like you .
If anyone talks foul about him again , I won 't leave that person alone , no matter who .
Got it ?
If I 'm a star , I 'm a star .
No , dirty and filthy ... and disgusting right ?
You should at least say something .
Yoon .
Let 's break away with no hard feelings .
It 's our last day , so I want to end it nicely .
Are you really going to quit ?
I am going to quit .
Today is my last day .
Eunchae , you finish it off .
Mother , Eunchae is really going to quit today .
Son ...
If you were to ask me to choose between Eunchae and that Moohyuk guy or whatever ... I 'd pick Eunchae all the way .
What is wrong with everyone !
- I don 't like that guy either .
Why ? What don 't you like about him ?
- Just because .
I don 't like him .
So cut your stubbornness ..
But he 's a really cool guy .
You don 't even know him .
Eunchae , whatever happens , I 'm going to fire him .
So you stay with Yoon , okay ?
Mister !
Psycho !
Mister !
This sky isn 't that great .
The Australian sky is beautiful .
- Our country 's sky is pretty too .
Australia 's is prettier .
- Then go back to Australia .
If it 's that pretty , go to your country and live happily .
That 's my dream .
How would it feel to be up there ?
Would it be much better than here ?
Would it look cooler watching it from here ?
If you 're so curious , then why don 't you go ?
I am going .
In just a while ... I 'll be going too .
Yes ? ...
You 're finished ?
I 'm close by , I 'll be there soon .
There eating after the photo shoot .
Food food !
Aren 't you going to eat ?
Do you have money to buy a plane ticket ?
Want me to buy it for you ?
Yoon is going to fire you .
It was decided that way .
I guess it 's better this way .
Instead of wearing yourself out about it , It 's better to not start something that isn 't meant to happen .
So ... I 'm not saying that it 's happened to me before .
But from my experience ...
Before we 're too close and before emotions get deep ... we should just end it quick .
That way , you won 't be hurt and it 'll be easier to forget me .
This is the only place that 's opened .
I 'll buy you something nice when we go back to Seoul .
- Well , nothing we can about that .
Come sit here .
Excuse me !
I 'll have Galbi Soup .
- I 'll have Gong Soup .
Our place has Soondae and Soondae soup .
Would soondae please you guys ?
Sure , just give those then .
Then ... why ask for an order ?
I 'm stomach ...
I 'll go to the restroom and come back
Where 's the restroom ?
Go straight ... and then go straight again ... and from there turn around ... and go straight and there it is .
Where did that lady say it is ?
- I don 't know either .
How can she put her finger in the soup and serve it ?
- Let 's just eat it , ma 'am .
It 's quite good .
- It 's good .
It 's disgusting and dirty .
What is that ?
That 's cow blood , right ?
I can 't eat this .
Just try some .
It 's really good .
I lost my appetite .
I can 't eat this stuff .
These are for rustics .
You eat all of it .
Let 's be quiet .
Quiet !
Kang Hui-sook ...
( tag reads Jung Hui-soo )
Kim Kungwoo ... you two !
Oh ... the smell !
I don 't think I can do this here .
Hello ?
Huh ? What happened to my mother ?
Don 't do it , Eunchae .
I 'm going to show everything to Yoon .
Please calm down .
You there !
You messed with the wrong person today .
Your business is over , lady ! I 'm going to tell my son and have this place torn down and a new building built on top of it .
What the heck is she blabbing about .
Let go !
Yoon !
- What happened to your face ?
That lady ... she poured that hot boiling rice soup on me . I burned my face .
What did you do mom ?
- What do you mean what did I do ?
I only said I can 't eat the food because it 's not to my taste .
Look at her now ... she 's trying to pour that hot soup again on me .
As long as I 've lived , this is the first time I 've dealt with this .
I think I want to die , Yoon .
Son !
Son !
What 's wrong , what 's wrong ?
Have you gone insane ?
Go up first , ma 'am .
Why ?
What about you ?
I need to stop by somewhere .
- Stop by where ? I have a friend who lives by here .
Go up first .
What friend ?
What friends of yours don 't I know about ?
I 'll see you in Seoul , ma 'am .
If they were adopted at that time these should be the babies .
Can you photo copy one for me ?
Excuse me ?
How may I help you ?
- I just have some questions to ask .
Does a Yoon Suh-kyung reside here ?
Yoon Suh-kyung ?
- Yes , Yoon Suh-kyung .
Oh that girl .
She lived here for quite a while .. but she moved a few months ago .
Moved ?
- Yes .
Why are looking for her ?
It 's nothing .
I beg your pardon .
What 's the difference between Jjangoo and Octopus ?
- Jjangoo and Octopus ?
What is the difference ?
Jjangoo is ...
Well , Jjangoo is .
Jjangoo can 't be dried while Octopus can be .
Oh , that 's true .
You didn 't have to go that far . You overreacted .
That 's why we paid them for the damage .
Money is not everything .
Ah , I know now ... why Eunchae stayed behind .
Why ?
The soup place .
She probably went to that lady .
She 'd go there ...
Ma 'am . Have a seat .
I 'll clean it for you .
Just be seated , ma 'am .
Turn around .
A while ago it seemed you hurt your back .
I 'll put a patch on it .
No , would you rather go to the hospital with me ?
I 'm tired . Mom , I wanna sleep .
Sleep , my son .
Were you alarmed ?
I 'm sorry for that . It was my fault .
It 's ok .
Sing a lullaby .
Yes , ma 'am .
I 'm in front of the house .
- We will be arriving very soon .
Yoon is sleeping .
Alright , see you later .
Yoon .
Wakeup !
Son , wake up , we 're home .
Have fun ?
I missed you so much I thought I was going to die .
- Me too ! Have a good time ?
You can go home now .
You did a good job .
I 'll call you .
Let 's go in .
Is he your new manager ?
But not after tomorrow .
- That won 't be necessary .
I want to keep him for now .
As you said , he might be an okay guy .
I 'll try to assure Eunchae about it .
I 'm hungry .
Make me something good , son .
Did the Seoul train leave ?
- It left .
Ma 'am !
- Yes ?
Where 's my wife ?
- She 's in there .
Open up !
Open up !
Where is this girl ?
Lady ... get out .
You ... live here ?
We 've met before , right ?
You must be the new guy that moved in downstairs .
The world is quite small , isn 't it ?
All the better .
That day was crazy .
If it 's alright with you , I 'd like to buy you a new dog .
What do you think you 're doing ?
Are you toying with me ?
But , you got the wrong person , lady .
Hey !
How do people like that exist ?
Sister . Why are you sleeping here ?
Why the floor and not the bed ?
Sleep comfortably on the bed .
I told you to sleep on the bed !
Mother ...
How long do you intend to live this way ?
Till death ... you want to live the rest of you life wrapped up in a small area like that ?
Now you can live like a proper person ...
on a nice bed , wearing nice clothes , eating good food !
Me , your brother is giving this life to you .
Shut up !
Quiet !
What did mom do for you that you 'd call her ?
Where 's mother ?
Where is a mother for us ?
Mother ...
- Shut up !
Be quiet , you idiot !
My mother is not an idiot .
Mom ...
Galchi ...
Did you hit my mother ?
Galchi , let 's go back to our home . Okay .. okay .
Let 's go home .
Let 's go home , mom .
Who was it ?
Was it Yoon ?
Why don 't you kill me !
Dry up my blood and kill me !
Friend , whatever ...
You went to the soup place , right ?
I just know it .
I mean , Moohyuk caused the damage , so why did you settle things ?
Do you have that much strength ?
Look at you ...
looking all yellow .
I stayed up all night because of you .
You know that ?
- I do .
What do you know ?
- I thought it was you .
What ?
I knew you were the one taking care of me all night .
What are you talking about ?
Thank you , Yoon .
I 'm really really thankful .
If not for you , I ... I would have died .
Thank you for saving my life , Yoon .
Hey , why are you crying all of sudden ?
For not knowing your heart , and for getting angry at you ...
I 'm so sorry , Yoon .
For being mean to you ... and making you sad ...
I 'm so sorry .
No
I 'm more sorry , actually .
I was wrong , Eunchae .
I won 't do that again ...
Me too ...
I won 't do that again too .
Episode 7
Didn 't I warn you before ?
Don 't touch me if you don 't have any intentions to go all the way
It 's been awhile , what are you doing here ?
Did you eat ?
I didn 't see anything ok ?
I didn 't want anything yet , it 's good that you 're here
let 's go
Where ?
to Yoon 's
Why should I go ?
I 'll leave
If it 's because of the scandal and it 's hard for you , I 'll disappear from Yoon 's sight .
So stop playing around and let 's go
People can 't know it 's you
You can breathe right ?
Taxi ... taxi ... taxi ...
Yoonah , Yoonah , Minjoo is here
You 've been ok ?
I 'm not mad at you
Considering how much you put up with a player like me , how can I be mad at you ?
I don 't have the right
I thought that the person you needed most was Eunchai and not me .
It 's not jealousy .
It 's the truth
Not you too !
How can you say that ?
She 's like a part of my bone
Eunchai likes you Yoon . Euchai loves you
Hey rockhead , let 's play with me
yeah , let 's go
How do I know the bus number going to Maljookuri ?
I don 't know !
So what am I supposed to do ?
What kind of tongue do you have ?
Do you have half a tongue or something ? [ meaning you have no respect ? ]
Stop it you old geezer . Stop it !
I 'm going to break your cane
Mister , give me that cane
I 'm sorry , please forgive him ...
I 'm so sorry
Dammit , I can 't get hit on the head .
I knew this day would come .
I knew you would pay the price . You only know casual talk and have no respect
You 're lucky Mister that this is the only punishment you got .
If it were me , I would have shown you no mercy . NONE !
How can this man become a human ?
Thank you
I 'm not going to play with you
( teaching him polite expression )
I am sorry
I don 't know
Where are you going ?
It 's very delicious
If you are not sure of the expression , just add ' Yo ' at the end of the sentence
Yo ?
Sleep well ( in slang )
Have a nice night
What 's this ?
What is this ?
You look cool
You look great
How did you learn Korean ?
From my wife
Wife ?
Are you married ?

It 's just over there .
Here I 'll give you a few apples
Rock head !
Song Eunchai
Yoonah ...
I love you Eunchai till my muscles tremble till my bones pained . Song Eunchai
Yoonah ...
Wow ... this girl 's heart is actually racing !
What are you doing ?
This can 't be , it can 't happen
What are you talking about ?
You said you like me , you love me
Who said that ?
Minjoo
That stupid girl , Minjoo
This can 't be . Does this make sense ?
We are family , we 're like siblings . You know that we 're close
Wake up Eunchai !
Both of us can never be man and woman , you know ?
Even if you were butt naked in front of me , it wouldn 't make a difference .
Don 't get yourself confused
Just have some patience , I 'm going to introduce you to a great guy
It 's me Hyung .
I mean a fianc ?
Actually I wanted to introduce you to him .
All four of us should go out for dinner sometime
Are you kidding me ?
No
Then what does he do ?
He 's just a salary man .
He lives in a really nice apartment in Kangnam [ a rich part of Seoul ]
He 's rich , kind , handsome , and really sophisticated .
I think that he 's my ideal type .
I should have told you earlier .
I 'm sorry for the mixup
Eunchai
Who is it ?
That first kiss guy ...
Yoon 's manager
Yeah , I left him yesterday without telling him .
He must have searched all over for me
Yesterday ?
Sister ... I met him yesterday and he looks like a wolf he 's really someone to be sorry for
So ... what are you going to do ?
Perhaps if I ask him to date again , he would say that I was crazy
Like " who are you playing " and I 'll probably get hit right ?
Sister !
I couldn 't sleep last night was thinking last night that no matter who I meet , I couldn 't meet anyone who likes me so much .
is this because of Yoon ? And how he 's uncomfortable . So now that you 're just going to grab that " dog guy ?
Moonyuk-off the streets and be with him .
I understand .
'Chae Yoon is mine Kang Min Joo ? Tsk tsk ...
Is it that obvious ?
When you look at me , is it that obvious that I like him when you see it ?
because you 're born as a girl , there isn 't one girl alive who couldn 't love him .
How can you not love a cool guy like that .
But that cant be Sister , you can 't be with that ' dog guy ?
I already kissed him and slept with him Are you living in Chosun dynasty ?
( Ancient time of Korean history )
I feel sorry for him huh ? When I look at him , I think he is just looking at me .
He is shy and awkward and he can 't show his best front .
Who is she talking about ?
Yoon 's manager . That old wolf !
You can 't !
He 's mine !
I saw him first
What is the farthest place from Korea ?
The hardest place to get to ?
Is there such a thing ?
Africa ?
he 's mine !
Africa ?
Missed call from Eunchai
Did you do all the stuff I told you to do ?
Yea ... .
Then come to Minjoo 's place ASAP
Ok
It 's done right ?
So if Minjoo comes from here to there ...
I hope she doesn 't get confused .
I 'm nervous
How do I look Brother ?
Minjoo has to be touched .
She will be touched
If Minjoo accepts my proposal , I will treat you nicely brother
Ok
Thank you , go on now
Oh , Yoonah , You 're here ?
Just come up then .
Nevermind , I 'll be down in 10 minutes
Where is this place ?
Can 't you read ?
Do I look that gullible to you ?
Even though I 'm a playgirl , I 'm picky for the time and partner
Didn 't I say before that if you don ' have any intention , don 't touch me ?
I won 't ever look for you again . Just see me , I have a room at Seoul Hotel .
Have a meal together
Sorry Yoon , I have something urgent to do .
I went somewhere else .

You were adopted to Australia ?

Isn 't that a bit too much ?
I 'm doing it correctly !

If there was a crazy dog after me , I would pee in my pants too .
Stop crying .
It 's Ok

I 'm sorry .
I was supposed to say that she peed on herself
Mommy , I 'm sorry . I won 't do it again
You did well , you did very well . You 're cool

Kalchi , National Anthem song
Mister , are you okay ?
Can I ask you a favor ?
What ?
Don 't go to Africa , you could take care of my sister and Kalchi later when I am not here
Are you going somewhere ?
Back to Australia ?
You said that you didn 't have anyone back there
Why don 't you stay here with your family .
Your wife is already married
It 's cold .
Let 's go in
I wanted to hug you once
Last time I didn 't .
I 'll hold you now .
Is that Ok ?
Are you warm ?
You 're not sad anymore right ?
Translation by bellaangel012 with fixes by Saturn
Get yourself together . We can never be just a man and a woman , you know .
Even if you were butt naked in front of me , it wouldn 't make a difference . Don 't get yourself confused .
Why are you screaming at your sister ?
Why are you talking disrespectfully ?
YOU , shut up !
No matter how much I teach you , you still cant get yourself together . Bad man !
Don 't go EunChae .
If Min joo accepts my proposal , then I will treat you nicely Hyung .
Thank You , hyung .
Are you warm ?
You 're not sad anymore , right ?
You got a good taste .
The scarf , mom liked it a lot .
I think you succeeded .
If you were trying to seduce me , you did it nicely .
I 'm starting to have interest in you .
But , this is the end ; I 'm too grown up to be seduced by a playboy like you .
Unfortunately , I can finally draw a line between love and passion .
Did you get a good sleep , Eun Chae ?
Sister !
I 'm gonna go make a phone call .
Hello .
Min Che ,
Big sis !
Is mom dad well ?
Tell them that I 'm doing ok so don 't worry too much .
Yeah , I 'm really ok .
Is that Eun Che ?
Hey , Eun Che ?
Give it here !
Give it to me !
I 'm still talking to her !
Listen to mom ,
Listen to you sis ...
Hey , Eun Che , it 's mom , have you eaten ?
Hey , Eun Che , it 's big sis , I shrunk your panty . Come home soon .
Big sis , Suk Che took your cell and made international calls and saw movies , ah .. ouch !
Don 't hit me !
We 're going to move out , Eun Che !
...
We 're going to move out even if we have to loan lots of money . So come home ASAP .
I 'm really doing well mom !
I will get tough as a rock when I return .
So don 't worry and take care .
I 'm gonna buy a lotto ticket while I 'm out for grocery ,
Watch me , I 'll build a house twice as big right across from this one .
If mom didn 't get so many Botax shots and give up a few line , We own a building by now .
I hear ya . What about you ?
Over-crediting sister 's card , dad 's card , buying all brand clothing , bags , and shoes ...
Yet you earn no money , if it wasn 't for you , we would be so rich , you idiot
I hear ya .
Mrs. !
Oppa !
What 's going on ?
Choi star comeing to such crappy place ?
Give me some food !
I wanted to eat your food !
Sure , come sit here ,
Eun Chae , didn 't she call you ?
Just a while ago ,
There wasn 't any call .
You came to check up on Eun Chae cause you were worried , didn 't you ?
Check up ? What check up ?
anyway that girl must be crazy !
She doesn 't even know how scary and violent the world is ...
Mrs. Are you just going to sit there ?
Shouldn 't you report for MIA ?
Don 't you know that a girl can break as soon as they go outside ?
Just like a plate when you throw it !
Just eat your food !
What do you care if Eun Che picks her ear with a street light pole or peel an apple with nail cutter !
I hear ya
Rice cake ! Buy rice cake !
We have fresh and warm rice cake !
We have warm rice cake !
Kim-bab !
Buy kim-bab !
We have awesome tasting kim-bab !
We have awesome tasting kim-bab !
Don 't go
Don 't go , Eun Chae
I won 't burden you
My sister can really make good kimbap
But she can 't make kimchi
Hold on , Look at me as well .
Oh Lord ,
If you really do exist ,
I promise you , Song Eun Che , If you let her be beside me for rest of my time ,
Thank you
If you let her comfort me for the time I have left ,
If you don 't hurt me again ,
I 'll give up my life right now .
My hatred , my anger , I 'll throw them away ,
And quietly die ,
Lord ,
I make the promise with you .
Damn it , isn 't this a dark circle ? ...
A-woo , wha do I do ?
Eun-Che !
I got a dark circle !
Eun-Che ,
I don 't like this kind of style ,
This type of stripe doesn 't fit me well , and I hate this style the most !
I 'm sorry , I didn 't know , I 'll go look for other ones ,
Big sis !
Eat slowly , Song Min-Che , I 'll buy you another .
Big sis , who is this girl ?
Oh , a sis I know well .
But , I don 't think she 's well .
She had an accident when she was young ,
She 's very kind and nice sis .
So , are you staying at her house now ?
Yeah ,
Give that here .
Oh , hold on ,
About $ 200 , don 't you think ?
You don 't even have money ?
Don 't you have a credit card ? ...
Oh yeah , Suk-Che-unni took your card .
Isn 't it really hard to get over Yoon oppa ?
Not really ,
I guess it 's stupid for me to ask .
But really , I think I 'm very much over Yoon now .
You don 't have to lie to me !
You don 't think I know love ?
I 'm gonna go to bathroom .
Ok , want me to come with you ?
No , it 's ok ,
I 'm alway with Yoon except when I 'm asleep , Whether Yoon is with me or not ,
To my eyes that 's all I could see .
I told you , I know how you feel .
But , now I see someone else ,
Sometimes I still see Yoon , but now , I keep seeing him .
Who , who is it ?
Ah , Gal-Chi !
Huh ?
Gal-Chi ?
Crap ! I was to meet with Gal-Chi 's teacher , I 'll be right back .
Take care of that big sister .
Gal-Chi 's teacher ?
... are you going to the underwater castle ?
Yeah , mom .. what ?
Laundry ?
... you left it on top of the stove ?
I 'm outside too ...
Can 't you try Suk-Che ?
... where are you ?
Ok , I 'll go home right now ,
Hey , Gal-Chi !
Big sis !
Sorry , did you wait long ? ...
Come on ... teacher must be waiting .
I don 't have to go to school ,
Are you going to sell kim-bab then ?
well , I can help your mom , or your uncle can help ,
I 'm sure there are other that can help your mom , you don 't have to worry .
You can go to school with out a worry .
Sis !
I 'll be right back after I turn off the stove and go to the bathroom .
Don 't go anywhere and stay put . Don 't go anywhere from here !
Yes ,
Wow , fish ,
I 'm gonna take a nap , I 'm so tired , when are we doing the radio show ?
11 : 30pm
Come at 6 : 30pm then . I 'll see you in a bit ,
Hey you !
Hey you !
Who are you ?
Who are you and why did you intrude my house ?
Who are , ?
...
Oh ? ... That pin ,
I bought it for Eun-Che from Italy ,
Where did you get it ?
Eun-Che gave it to me a while ago ,
Eun-Che , you saw her ?
Where is Eun-Che ?
Eun-Che , is she home ?
Um .. no ..
Where is Eun-Che ?
Ice cream
Song Min-Che !
What happened ?
Where are you now ?
!
We got a problem , big sis !
That unwell girl ... Yoon oppa took her away as a hostage just now .
What ?
Yoon oppa said , Eun-Che sis have to come get her if you want to find her .
Do you like it ?
It 's alright
Did you talk to Eun-Che ?
Yes .
Don 't go
Don 't go , Eun Chae
I won 't burden you
Don 't go
Wow , pretty ...
Wow ,
So pretty .
Min Chae
Hello .
Oh , Min-Che , why are you standing there like that ? Do you need to go to the bathroom ?
Umm ..
I 'm just , what u doing ?
Do you really need to crap ?
Noo !
I crapped it all out before !
Is Yoon home yet ?
Son ~ !
My son ,
How was your day ?
Was it a nice day ?
Mom , I 'm so tired ,
Why ?
What is it ? Because of Eun-Che ?
Forget it ,
I wanna go home ,
Wow , what a pretty old lady ,
What is she ?
What the ... that 's my necklace , it 's my necklace ,
Miss , who are you ?
Which room did you just came out of ?
Yoon !
Who is this girl ?
Just someone I know ,
Don 't scare her , mom , I don 't think she 's normal .
Stay here , don 't you move .
Didn 't they say where they would go ?
Yeah , she said she will come back home soon after getting my mom so go wait at home .
I will come back soon , When Eun-Che comes tell her to stay put and don 't go anywhere .
Yes .
I wanna go home
I wanna go back to my home
Galchi , Galchi
Don 't cry , don 't cry ..
Why did you have to call the cops ?
You could have just asked her nicely ,
She kept on denying when I asked !
Gal-Chi , Gal-Chi ~ ,
Where did you hide the rings ?
Huh ? Give the rings back !
I 'm serious !
I think she really doesn 't know ,
Why don 't you go look for it again ?
I 've just looked everywhere !
... .
You know how much that diamond ring cost ?
! It 's priceless !
Yoon , why did you bring someone like that into the house ?
I said why did you bring her to cause this , you fool !
This small , shiny sparkling thing , haven 't you seen the ring ?
Think about it ,
I wanna go to my home , wanna go back to my home ,
I think she 's a pro , acting all stupid , Did you hide it in your underwear ?
Or maybe you swallowed it didn 't you !
Gal-Chi , Gal-Chi ~ ,
Confess before cops come in and make it more serious ,
If you confess now I 'll forgive you without pressing charges ,
Tell me now !
Uncle , uncle ,
What 's the problem ?
I 've lost a 6-carat diamond ring .
Sorry , but could you take your socks off ?
Don 't just frisk her ,
I told you she hid it in the underwear , Strip search her .
It 's not like you have physical evidence .
Also that would be violation of civil rights .
Thief doesn 't have civil rights !
Where did you hide it ?
Seriously , where did you hide it ?
Huh ?
Uncle ! uncle !
Told you to listen when I asked nicely ,
Why didn 't you listen to me ?
Come on , take this off too .
I don 't want to , no .. don 't want to .
Gal-Chi , .Gal-Chi ~
Mister ... umm .. well
Where is my sister ?
Isn 't she with you ?
She 's inside
Uncle ,
Mr. Car !
What the ?
!
You know her ?
!
Get on my back , big sis ,
Oh Lord , if you really do exist ,
I promise to you .
Mister
If you have her stay next to me for the time I have left .
Song Eun Chae
Let go , Let go !
Mister
If she will comfort me for the time I have left ,
If you don 't hurt me anymore .
I can give up my life right now .
I can throw away my hatred , and anger ..
I can die quietly ,
Lord , I make the promise with you
What the ...
You !
You were at Moo-Hyuk 's place this whole time ?
Were you staying with Moo-Hyuk , this whole time ?
Are you crazy ?
Don 't yell .
Eun-Che ,
Why are you yelling ?
Why are you yelling at me ?
I didn 't do anything wrong to you so why are you yelling at me ?
And I 'm not crazy ,
I 'm very fine , Yoon , .
Why are you like that ?
Seriously , you act like someone else !
You did wrong today ,
To Suh-Kyung unni ,
To Mr. Moon-Hyuk , you did them wrong , big time .
That stupid girl was Mr. Car 's older sister ?
Anyhow she is a thief for sure ,
Would the ring jumped up to the sky ?
Or into the ground ?
Ahh , my blood pressure ..
Oooo , .my ring , what about my ring ?
What do I do ?
I found something that 's not ring nor a necklace ,
What ?
What is that ?
... bring it here .
What is it , oppa ?
Bring it here , hurry .
Oh , it 's nothing big , madam ,
What do I do about my ring ... my ring ... what do I do ,
She passed out early so probably doesn 't even know they are twins Let 's assume that they are dead ,
You , Nurse Kim and I , we have to keep it secret till we die ...
About today . They weren 't meant to be with their mother , .
Ah Duh Lee 's narration at the radio station on EP03
A Father 's Prayer written by by General Douglas MacArthur
Who is that guy ?
Where is mother ?
Where is a mother for us ?
What are they doing ?
I don 't know .
Where are you going , Eun-Che ?
Just out for a walk , and get some air .
My ring , my ring ,
Mom , don 't be sick over such a thing ,
It 's priceless ... priceless ... it 's very expensive ,
I 'll go buy you one , I 'll go out and buy you one in a bit , ok ?
You think you can buy that with money ?
Let 's make some Dduk-Bok-gi together , Eun-Che .
Let 's make some Dduk-Bok-gi .
Move !
Let 's make some Dduk-bok-gi !
Didn 't you hear me say " move " !
Dduk-bok-gi !
Dduk-bok-gi !
Dduk-bok-gi , go eat all you want !
Damn girl , don 't you know your place ?
Seriously !
Did you take some drug ? You did , didn 't you ?
If I did , I would have killed you by now !
Song Eun-Che !
How old are you ?
Grow up !
Dduk-bok-gi ?
How could you eat dduk-bok-gi right now ?
There are people who can 't sleep nor drink a drop of water because of you ,
Why is that my fault ?
Why is everyone blaming me ?
Why only me !
What a pity , Choi Yoon , What a shame , seriously ,
If you go , I 'll , .you !
... if you go .. i 'll .. !
Come here !
I 'm not a dog that comes and goes when you say so , you bastard .
Song Eun-Che !
Does it hurt a lot , mom ?
Should I go get some medicine ?
Mom , mom ,
Galchi
Big Sis
Didn 't you go to school ?
No ... because my mom is really sick ,
You mom ?
She 's sick ?
Yes .. i 'm going to get some medicine right now .
Still , you should go to school ,
Where is your uncle ?
I don 't know , he was gone when I woke up .
Big sis ..
I 'm so sorry , it 's all my fault , sorry , big sis ,
I didn 't steal the ring , I didn 't steal it .
I know , I know , sorry ..
I 'm really sorry ,
Oh , Yoon , I know all about it
I don 't think I can get exactly the same one , But I can probably get a similar one ,
Yeah , I 'm going out right now ,
If you get there earlier , just look around for a bit ,
I was wondering something , so I wanted to ask you ,
What 's the difference between passion and love ?
Was that passion for example ?
I love you
It just happened that way ,
I love you
Why did she hang up suddenly ?
Did she get on the elevator ?
Ah ,
It 's so complicated . Complicated ,
My mom , Eun-che , all so complicated ,
Min-Joo !
Your lover is about to die from this complication ...
For real
Don 't yell
Why are you yelling ?
Why are you yelling at me when I didn 't do anything wrong to you .
You did wrong today ,
To Suh-Kyung sis , to Mr. Moo-Hyuk ,
You did wrong to them , big time ,
She 's changed , she 's changed for sure ..
Is she dating Moo-hyuk hyung ?
...
Aaa , I don 't know , fine .. go date ..
What a great couple just like the roaches .
What about her liking me before ?
Stupid , stupid girl .
If she will comfort me for the time I have left ,
If you don 't hurt me anymore .
I can give up my life right now .
I can die quietly ,
I love you
It just happened that way
( when mom goes to island shore to get food )
( the baby watches the house alone )
Galchi , shhhhh ! ... . she 's sleeping ,
The temperature has decreased quite a bit now ,
Did you finish solving the math problem I gave you ?
Can I correct them now ?
Why is it so complicated ?
You can 't solve it , sis ?
No , .that 's not what I meant , Are you sure this is elementary school level math ?
Yes .
Empty your mind .
Stop thinking about that guy in your head and concentrate only on the ball .
Hey , listen !
I 'm not " hey " , I 'm Park Hyun-woo
Mr. Park Hyun-woo !
Don 't move your wrist or your arm .
Move your shoulder !
Don 't look at the ball flying when you hit it .
Keep looking at the ground !
I 'm sorry , Mister
Get in
Min-joo , open the door !
Who is the bastard next to you ?
The bastard sitting next to you , who is he !
Min Joo
Open the door !
Open it right now !
Min-joo !
Open the door Min-joo , please !
Uncle
Eun-chae , I don 't want to live anymore , Yoon

Hey , Will .
Wanted to tell you something , but we forgot .
Okay .
Thanks for coming .
No , wait .
Was it about his hair ?
Yes , you already told me that my hair looks like that chocolate topping that hardens when you put it on ice cream .
It totally does .
Our business here is done .
Wait .
I know what it was ...
Trans am .
Right .
My Trans Am 's been acting up again .
I gotta take it into the shop .
It 's lurching and sputtering and making weird noises .
Sounds like me when I try to dance .
Will .
Love yourself , man .
You need to follow me to the garage .
Craig , you need to bring the booty mug .
The booty mug ?
You still use that thing ?
'Course .
Gives me street cred with guys who do manly jobs .
The pipes are corroded .
It 's gonna cost you 1,000 bucks .
1,000 ?
You sure about that , chief ?
You seem like a pretty good guy .
I can probably do it for $ 200 .
All right .
I 'm gonna go look at some " playboys . "
Call me when you 're done . You got it .
There isn 't anything that mug can 't do .
Kenny , you should just work on your car yourself .
There 's nothing like the satisfaction of fixing something with your own hands .
Will , you know I have no mechanical skills .
My only true skills are lick-bathing myself like a cat and shake-drying myself like a dog .
One time I walked in on you taking a bath belly-down like a seal .
Keeps my butt-tocks cool . so ...
I 've got news .
Grant and I are thinking of moving in together .
Really ? Well , that is great .
I got to say , this is the healthiest relationship that you have ever had .
But first I want to provoke him into having a big , ugly fight .
There 's the girl I know .
It 's just , we 've never fought , and I want to know what that 's like before I commit .
Well , that makes sense , Theresa says , not meaning it , but trying to be supportive .
When I was with Kenny , fighting was the worst thing about our marriage ...
That , and sleeping with him was like being steamrolled by a bag of elbows .
Well , good luck getting grant to fight .
It 'd be easier to get a rainbow to flip you off .
I know .
The man has no buttons to push .
This one , however , is all buttons .
Hey , Kenny .
Shmermi .
Shmermi ?
What the hell does that mean ?
You 're relentless !
You guys ready to go ?
Shut up , bro .
Didn 't mean that .
That was the booty mug talkin ' .
Since you 're following me to the mechanic 's , you should know that something clear and sticky is spewing out of the Trans Am 's tailpipe .
It is outrageously flammable , so keep your distance .
I don 't know why you keep that piece of junk , Kenny .
I still think dad only gave it to you as punishment for quitting football .
I didn 't quit football .
I was thrown off the team for crying , and that car 's just a little quirky .
No , it 's a giant quirk that 's a little car-y .
I worked on it with dad when we were kids , Kenny . I should know .
Let it die already .
It 's just showing its age .
Who here among us hasn 't , at some point in their lives , spewed a clear , flammable liquid ?
My God .
Am I the only one ?
Compression 's out of whack , rings are shot , timing belt needs replacing .
I 'm gonna nod like I understand , but I have no idea what you 're talking about .
All right , try this ... $ 5,000 .
Craig ?
Booty ?
Do something .
You sure about that number , big dog ?
You seem like a good guy .
Can 't help you with the money , but I 'd love to go bowling with you sometime .
No !
Kenny , come here .
We can totally fix your Trans Am ourselves .
I have tons of car tools ...
Lifts , gauges , uh , one of those wrenches , uh , what 's it called ?
Goes ...
You 're not inspiring confidence .
Ratchet .
Yes , they 're filthy animals , but how does that help us ?
Kenny , I fix stuff around the house all the time .
Come on .
We can totally do this .
Okay , Will .
I will fix this car with you .
Tiny little baby lips .
I 'm sorry .
There was a lot of fumes in the Trans Am on the way over .
Yeah , looks like what we 've got here is some of those steel-belted sons of bitches ?
Nice mug .
No .
It 's just an ironic anti-objectification ...
No , seriously , I love it .
It 's funny .
It 's great to see a guy who 's not afraid to be a guy .
I 'm Becky .
I 'm Craig .
So tell me about yourself .
Wait , I 'm not interested ...
Because I 'm a guy .
I 'm taking out the recycling .
I 'll do it .
It 's my house .
But , Brenda , that 's recycling .
Yeah , but I 've been thinking , who really cares about the planet ?
As long as it holds up till I 'm dead , screw the next generation .
So grant cleans when he gets mad ? I know .
Isn 't that weird ?
He 's handsome , charming , and now this .
If you tell me that nagging makes him horny , I 'm gonna kill you .
The guy 's even ironing my sheets .
I feel like the pope .
For some reason , I 've always imagined that the pope has a hot black guy that irons his sheets .
So what happened to finding out if you should move in together ?
Yeah , I 'm putting that on the back burner , which , by the way , is very clean .
Uncle Kenny and daddy are arguing in the garage .
They said I could have ice cream if I didn 't tell you the bad words they said .
Chocolate , please .
How can you mix up my car parts with pieces of your lawn mower ? !
I just put a few pieces in the wrong pile , okay ?
I know what I 'm doing , Kenny .
Who 's the one who got the master cylinder out ?
We didn 't need to take the master cylinder out ! Yeah ?
Well , then , how were we supposed to get to the screwdriver that I dropped ?
Yeah , this looks about right .
Boys , why don 't you consider this the autopsy and just get rid of the body ?
I can fix this .
I 'm the one who figured out how to get our hands unstuck from the air conditioner vent , wasn 't I ?
We 're stuck .
Does anybody even know we 're here ?
I knew this is how death would find me .
That wasn 't exactly a challenge .
We just had to calm down and unclench our fists .
I 'm serious , Will .
This already feels like one of those projects that you start and never gets done , like Lucy 's swing set .
Lucy doesn 't have a swing set .
She only has a bag of bolts and chains and swings she plays with next to her lumber pile .
Damn it , Will .
I 'm gonna finish that .
Theresa just gets impatient .
She doesn 't understand that sometimes a guy needs a little break to come up with a plan .
I don 't want this thing in my garage forever .
If it 's still here in a week , I 'm gonna take care of it myself .
Honestly , Kenny , you should just let it die a dignified death , like we didn 't do with grandma .
This car is nothing like grandma .
It doesn 't spit or slap or say racist things .
But if you don 't put it back together , I 'm-a do all that , you lazy , lily-white snow devil .
So I went on my date with Becky , the tow truck driver , and I wore that belt buckle my uncle Roger gave me that just says , " balls . "
I never understood that buckle .
It needs a verb or something .
Real men don 't use verbs .
So ... I problem Becky .
You me advice .
You need to use verbs .
Fine .
Becky 's great ...
Pretty , firm handshake , conversationally vulgar ...
Everything you 'd want in a woman .
The thing is ... She 's a sexist .
She has a problem with men ?
No , not with men .
Stupid woman driver .
Most women should be banned from the road .
And look at her cry .
Crybaby .
What are you , on your period ? !
Okay .
Here 's my advice .
Dump her .
I need different advice .
Then put up with her .
I can 't , Will .
Sexism goes against everything I believe .
People who ascribe stereotypical traits to a group of other people are all the same , and they should be rounded up and treated as inferior .
Maybe you should talk to her .
Tell her it bothers you .
I want to , but how does a guy wearing a testicle-referencing belt buckle talk about his feelings ?
I trouble .
Hey ! I need my car , Will .
What are you wearing ?
Shorts .
I 've been riding my bike to go do my rounds because some idiot took apart my car and won 't put it back together again !
I 'm figuring it out .
I went online to do some research , but I didn 't find anything helpful .
But I did see this really funny video of this fat kid on a roller coaster .
You will fix this car , Will .
You will , Will .
The question is , can he ?
What ?
No , I 'm saying , " can he ? "
What ?
" Can he " fix the car ?
I 'm not gonna fix it . He took it apart .
He should do it .
Who , Will ?
He will !
I know !
He , Will .
You , Kenny . I , Craig .
See , this is how real men talk .
Hi , Will .
What 's the matter ?
Does it upset you when someone takes apart your car and doesn 't put it back together ?
Weird .
So that 's what we 're gonna do ?
Well , remember , I 'm the one with all the tools !
Except the biggest tool of all ... You !
Mr. Patterson .
Whales are stupid and they take up too much room in the ocean .
These get washed on gentle .
It 's just you .
You almost triggered my flight-or-curl-up-into-a-ball response .
I hope you don 't mind I let myself in .
Brenda figured out I clean when I get angry , and she 's been taking advantage of that .
I don 't want her to benefit from her extremely effective sneak-ery .
So why don 't you just talk to her about your feelings ?
Isn 't that what you hippies do ?
I 'm worried if I talk to her about it , I 'll get angry , and that 'll make me clean , and around and around we 'll go .
Then why don 't you make her angry so she sees how it feels ?
That 's the only language that tiny sack of evil understands .
Okay .
How do I make her angry ?
Well , when we were married , I discovered a few things that piss her off .
Accidentally throwing up on her while she 's sleeping on the plane , accidentally throwing up on her while trying to get an eyelash out of her eye , accidentally throwing up on ...
If possible , I 'd love to get out of the whole upchuck arena .
Well , she does hate being scared .
I once jumped out of a pile of laundry .
She got so mad ... It made me throw up on her .
Scare her ?
Like , " boo ! " ?
Not quite .
Let me get a beer , and we 'll work on it .
That was better ?
What the hell ?
I meant to tell you , will stopped by earlier and disassembled your refrigerator .
And you just let him ?
I don 't know what sort of arrangement you fellas have .
And that 's why I gave up cage fighting .
I love fighting , of course . I just hate being caged in .
My brothers love fighting , too .
You should fight them sometime .
Yeah .
She didn 't add the check right .
Big surprise ...
A woman who can 't do math .
You know , Becky , you say a lot of negative things about women .
Yeah .
Now let 's go home and get those pants off you , dummy .
Okay .
Now .
Okay .
I 'm gonna tear you up .
I 'm in .
Kenny .
Sorry , Will .
My money 's on Kenny .
So Becky and I went out last night , and she was God-awful , but I didn 't say anything because my wiener wanted to have a sexy adventure .
Anyway , I figure it 's not wrong for me to keep seeing Becky as long as I counterbalance her sexist behavior .
So whenever I 'm not with her , I 'm gonna be extra , extra , super-duper supportive of women .
I started this morning .
Let me ...
I 'm sorry , I was about to treat you like an incapable woman , but instead , I will celebrate your powerful female ability .
You go , girl .
You can do it .
You can do it .
You can do it .
Lift that water .
You go , girl .
You do it .
You can lift that water .
Lift that water .
I 'm still fine-tuning the concept .
What you 're doing is crazy .
Yeah , well , from the looks of your desk , you certainly know crazy .
In fact , you 're a barmaid sitting on crazy 's lap , and crazy is drunk , trying to unbutton your blouse , and you 're not doing anything to stop him .
How am I supposed to answer that ?
One second .
Hi , Will .
Sorry we missed you .
It 's the screws from your desk .
We 're taking a personal day .
- Well , hey , guys .
I just got a text from Theresa .
You only have four days to fix my car before she gets rid of it .
My God .
What happened to your desk ?
I would have been done fixing your car by now if you hadn 't distracted me by acting all crazy .
You know crazy .
And once crazy gets your blouse unbuttoned , he takes you out to a field by the train tracks , lays you down on a dog blanket .
You just keep staring up at that moon , hoping one day you 'll get out of this town and prove your daddy wrong , because you 're a dancer , damn it ...
That 's it .
I 'm outta here .
What 's his problem ?
I have no idea .
Not my favorite suit .
No !
I hope revenge suits you , William j .
I 'm just saying , that car 's taking up room in the garage , I can smell it in the house , and I need it out of here .
Well , I 'm not gonna fix it now .
Your brother 's being too big a jerk .
Will , would you come here a minute ?
I know you don 't want to back down for some stupid man reason , but can you please fix my brother 's car , preferably tonight so I can pee without crouching like an ancient roman ?
I can 't fix his car .
You were right about me .
I don 't finish things .
I jus ... I get overwhelmed and I give up .
If I really picked apart my personality , I 'd have to say ...
Forget it .
Well , I 'm giving up on the toilet , too , and that 's sad , since it 's been the site of some of my greatest victories .
Look , maybe you just need to pick one thing and follow through on it , just to show yourself you can do it ...
Not fixing the toilet , because the stakes are too high , but this did all start with Kenny 's car .
You 're right .
I need to see something through to the end .
And I 'm gonna get started on that right now .
It 's happening !
Global warming !
What are you doing in my sleeping quarters ?
I 'm taking apart your bed .
I 'm not gonna quit this , Kenny .
I need to prove to myself that I can finish something , and that thing is this ridiculous war with you .
Why don 't you just finish putting my car back together , you butt-piston ?
Because I have no mechanical abilities whatsoever .
Then why did you take it apart in the first place ?
! Because I have no reasoning abilities whatsoever .
So I 'm gonna disassemble your life piece by piece until there 's nothing left but a pile of beard hair and silly t-shirts .
I 've never seen you this way before .
You 're so determined .
Such man-like qualities .
It 's like you have a booty mug ... Inside your soul .
Okay .
Clearly , you want this more than I do .
I 'm gonna figure out another way to fix my car .
Really ?
Yeah .
I saw something through to the end ?
Take that , crazy !
You were wrong about me .
I am a dancer .
You go , Will !
Live your dreams for the rest of us !
You maniac .
Wait !
What are you doing ?
! I 'm sorry , Kenny . Time 's up .
I know you have a lot of memories with this car , but it 's time to let it go , sweetie .
Okay , get this piece of crap outta here .
No !
Not Trans Am-mie !
You can 't tow it if I 'm sitting in it !
God .
Ow ! Son of a ...
Hang on !
So do we have six more weeks of winter , or what ?
Ha . That 's very funny .
Let me out .
Not until you do to this car what we 're pretty sure that disgruntled nurse did to grandma .
Fine .
I 'll reach the latch myself .
I choose to stay here for now .
Okay .
I don 't understand why you hate this car so much , Theresa .
Because it 's a jerk .
It 's not a jerk .
I should know what it is , Kenny .
I was the one who spent a summer working on it with dad , rebuilding the engine , replacing the gears in the differential .
I think I see what 's going on here .
You 're upset ...
About ... somethin ' .
I 'm upset because after all of that work , dad gave you the car instead of me , and it should have been mine .
Dad was not a great dad , Theresa .
When I was 10 , I caught a frog , I wanted to keep it as a pet , and he wanted to eat its legs .
Guess who won ?
And they were delicious .
On my prom night , I had a pimple , and dad pointed at it in front of my date and called it " mount facemore . "
I 'm sorry dad didn 't give you the car , Theresa .
Why don 't you take it now ?
How about this instead ? I 'll help you get it running if you let me drive it every once in a while ...
Like , when I have a cold and I can 't smell anything .
Deal .
High five ?
Hello and welcome to the first " hearthstone insurance career day for girls . "
Our theme is " Craig empowers future women . " Applaud .
No !
Don 't do what I say just because I 'm a man .
Hey , there you are .
I was in the neighborhood .
Thought I 'd see if you wanted to grab a steak or somethin ' .
What are you doing ?
I just wandered in here .
Wh ...
Mr. Griffith invited my class to hear a talk about a ... career for girls .
I don 't know who that is .
You 're really talking to these girls about careers ?
That 's a waste .
Why is it a waste ?
Well , first of all , most of you should not and will never have real jobs .
You 'll just find a guy to take care of you , squirt out a couple of kids , and try and hold on to your looks .
Wait a minute , wait a minute .
Becky , I 'm sorry , but your views about women are absolutely horrible .
I thought I could get over it because we had fantastic ... Playtime together .
I mean , really good , creative stuff .
But the bottom line is I think women can be whatever they want .
Like a doctor or a lawyer or ...
What do you want to be , sweetheart ?
A unicorn !
And you will be .
You see , Becky ?
I 'm a feminist , and while I wish she had said something like " astronaut " instead of a made-up creature , I think that these girls can do whatever they put their minds to .
I don 't believe this .
Your booty mug is a liar .
And to think I almost let you fight my four brothers ,
Mikey , Tommy , Danny , and Steve .
Four of ' em ?
This is a good man !
Let 's parade him around on our shoulders !
I don 't think that 's a good I ...
Actually , you know what ? What am I saying ?
If you can dream it , you can do it , ladies !
Hoist away !
So much for my nine years of karate .
My God .
Why did you scare me ?
I was trying to teach you a lesson about what it feels like to be emotionally toyed with .
I did not anticipate it ending in a stabbing .
Frankly , I 'm surprised about that , too .
The truth is ... I 'm scared about moving in together .
Maybe we should talk .
Good idea .
I 'll start .
Sometimes it 's important to let go of things so you can move on .
Will had to let go of wanting to be the kind of guy who could fix things .
For Theresa , it was letting go of her anger toward her dad .
For Brenda and grant , it was letting go of their fears so they could take the plunge and move in together .
But while it 's important to let things go , it 's also important to realize that some things are worth holding on to .
Why are you telling us all this ?
Seriously , who are these people ?
They 're my friends , and I wanted you to hear what they learned so you realize that you , too , can let go of anything that keeps you from your dreams .
This is boring .
I thought coming to an insurance company would be fun .
Frankly , Tess , with an attitude like that , you 'll never be a unicorn .
Anyway , I learned to let go of something , too .
Good-bye , booty mug .
Stay sharp , guys .
We gotta win tonight .
We cannot go to game seven .
Sure we can .
The tournament 's the best of seven , so we definitely can go to game seven .
Had you said , " I prefer not going to game seven " or " we shan 't go to game seven , "
that would have been more accurate .
And more eloquent .
Whatever .
These tournament games go on late , and I wake Theresa when I get in bed , which she hasn 't been happy about .
I 'd really like to wrap this up tonight , so I need you to focus .
You got it , buddy .
So , Kenny , how 's the new egg chair ?
Fantasteesh .
I put in surround sound and a butt warmer .
I got a beverage tube .
It 's like a giant robot chicken laid this just for my comfort .
So we 're not gonna focus then ?
Of course we are .
Hey , craigger , how 's the new girl ?
Does she really just like watching you play video games ?
Yep .
She is great .
We are talking about you , sunshine .
Focus , honey .
You don 't want this tournament going to game seven . Yeah .
That 's how Will should have said it .
I 'm taking fire , guys .
Who 's got my back ?
Where are you ?
I 'm reloading the sangria reservoir .
I 'm totally focused , bill .
And we 're going to game seven .
I thought we were gonna try and wrap this up tonight !
isn 't it fantastic ?
I 've wanted a family portrait like this ever since we had kids .
My goodness .
Why are you all so small and flat ?
- I 'm just kidding .
- That 's my impression of the first guy who ever saw a painting .
Looks like the artist got a little generous with your cleavage .
Yeah , he insisted my body type could handle it .
He said I 'll get used to them .
Yeah .
Good morning .
That 's a nice-looking family gathered around those boobs .
How 'd you sleep ?
Terrible .
You woke me up when you finally came to bed , and the neighbor 's stupid motion detector light was going off again all night , shining in our window .
Our new neighbor is a jerk .
It 's not just the light .
Every time the kids lose a ball over his fence , he refuses to give it back .
I have no tolerance for that .
Will , you need to go over there and get your balls back .
I know that sounds like a metaphor , but it is not , because that man has your actual balls , which also sounds like a metaphor and also is not .
I talked to him .
Believe me , we really went at it .
- Hi , Glenn .
- What ?
So I-I was trying to fish my kids ' balls out of your backyard with my rake , and so n-now you also have my rake ... And my longer rake , and ... okay .
Well , at least your stupid video game tournament is over so I don 't have to worry about you waking me up anymore .
Yeah , about that ...
The tournament 's not actually over .
You said it was only gonna be six games .
I overestimated my team 's focus ...
In that I thought they had any .
But it 's okay .
I don 't have to play tonight .
I mean , the ... you know , the guys are super excited about it , and it only happens once a year , but ... I can skip it , Even though it 's just one more night ...
Thank you , honey .
I appreciate it .
You told her you weren 't gonna play ?
This tournament is as important as anything we will ever do in our lives , right ? Why would you do that ?
If anything , you 're understating it .
You know , guys , we wouldn 't even have this problem if you 'd had my back last night instead of making out with your new girlfriend and messing with your sangria tank .
There was a chunk of orange stuck in my drinking tube .
Did you want me to just leave it there ?
It could have choked me , Will .
You are unbelievable .
First you endanger our entire tournament , and now you want Kenny to die ?
What is wrong with you ?
I got it .
I got the solution .
Fortunately for you , I 'm a pharmaceutical rep ...
With a bagful of tricks , one of which is ...
Wonunol .
" When you can 't sleep , take Wonunol .
" Remember ...
Wonunol .
Take one ... y 'all .
Yee-haw ! Sleep . "
They 're still working on the campaign .
Anyway , it 's all natural . There 's no hangover , and it 's tiny , so you can hide one in Theresa 's applesauce .
I 'm not gonna hide drugs in my wife 's food .
Come on .
But don 't worry .
I 'm gonna play tonight .
I 'll just lie to Theresa and tell her I 'm not going to , then I 'll wear my silk pajamas , and when she 's asleep , I 'll slip out of bed like a ninja , a comfortable ninja who 's used to the finer things .
I finished my homework .
Can I go to bed early ?
Are you sneaking out tonight ?
Stealing a car ?
Hitting the clubs ?
No , I just ate too much pie , and I want to go to bed .
Nathan , it 's okay .
Your father 's just kidding .
Of course you can go to bed .
You got a girl up there ?
Mom !
It 's too easy .
Lucy , you go get ready , too . I 'll be right up .
God , I haven 't slept more than two hours in a row this week .
If anyone wakes me up again tonight , I swear I 'm gonna kill them to death , and please don 't wear those silk pajamas you took out .
Really ?
Why not ?
Well , they get all staticky , and then I keep getting shocked .
I feel like I 'm sleeping with someone who 's trying to get information out of me .
You know , I was talking to Kenny about your problem , and ... and he 's kinda like a doctor , and he gave me this ...
Thing .
It 's supposed to be this great new ... Sleep supplement or something .
You trying to knock me out so you can play your stupid video game ?
What ?
I told you , I am not playing tonight .
I 'm just trying to help you sleep , and this pill 's supposed to be amazing .
I don 't like pills .
It 's not a pill .
It 's really more of , an organic sleep vitamin with metabolism-boosting , uh , anti-aging ... molecules .
I think one of the actresses from " mad men " takes it .
Really ?
That is a smart show .
We are good to go , and we still have an hour to practice before the tournament starts .
So Theresa 's sleeping ?
Yep .
I got her to take the Wonunol .
That thing was originally developed as a horse tranquilizer .
They just changed the formula for humans ... By cutting it in half .
You gave my wife a horse tranquilizer ?
No , you gave your wife half a horse tranquilizer .
Will , it 's fine .
Trust in science .
Pills make everything better .
In ten years , we won 't even need people anymore .
It 'll just be pills giving each other pills .
Yeah , there 'll be pill police officers .
There 'll be pill firemen .
The pill president .
He 'll be pill Clinton .
Dad ?
I threw up pie ...
Lots and lots of pie , more pie than I ate .
Did she say she threw a pie ?
It 's all right , honey .
Guys , I might have a situation .
Dad , I don 't feel so well .
Will , what 's going on over there ?
I definitely have a situation .
That sound .
God , I miss college .
Just gonna throw these sheets in the wash , kids .
Stay in the bathroom and aim for anything porcelain .
What are you guys doing here ?
We knew your hands were full , so we brought the tvs over so you can play .
And we 've still got a half an hour till the game starts , so , we 're gonna teach grant how to play , and then he can sub in for you when you get distracted by the disgusting vomitorium that is your home .
Although I 've never done this before , I will not let you down .
My only question is ...
I deplore violence ... is there a button on here for diplomacy ?
We 've got your back , Will . You just don 't want to bail on the tournament . You don 't have my back .
Don 't do this , Will .
Not in front of Gina .
This is Gina .
Hey , Will . I 'm Gina .
Don 't do this in front of me .
I drove all the way here with my egg chair on top of my car .
If that 's not having your back , I don 't know what is .
That 's not having my back !
Then I don 't know what is !
Guys , the game is not really my priority right now .
My kids have a stomach bug , somebody drugged my wife ...
You .
And I 'm gonna go start some laundry .
You have a lovely house .
Do you mind if I look around ?
Yeah , sure .
I just met you .
Wander around my home .
Dad , can I have a glass of water ?
I got this , Will .
I have a soothing effect on the infirm and , for some reason , the downtrodden and every once in a while , the misbegotten .
So ... do you like Gina ?
Yeah , sure .
Why not ?
She told me not to tell anybody , but she 's a kleptomaniac .
She has claws instead of hands ?
No , that 's not what a kleptomaniac is .
It 's somebody who has a compulsion to steal things .
It 's a disease .
Well , if she has a stealing disease , should we be letting her walk around Will 's house looking for things to steal ? According to her therapist ,
I 'm supposed to show her that I trust her .
Besides , Will doesn 't have anything that great anyway .
I 'm a bumblebee , and I need to see the moon , because it helps me navigate .
Karate chop !
That was weird .
And she 's naked from the waist down .
That 's very unlike her .
I think I need to check something online .
Hey .
So , um , Craig 's keeping an eye on the kleptomaniac .
What ?
Right .
Let me back up .
Hey , Will ...
Gina 's a kleptomaniac .
- What ?
- I know !
But you 've got a bigger problem .
Theresa 's up . God !
What ... no ...
Did she see all the game stuff ?
I am so busted .
You said she was gonna sleep all night !
I didn 't say she 's awake .
I said she 's up .
I just went online , and I did a little research on Wonunol .
One of the occasional side effects is walking around in a dream state with no pants on , due to an insatiable urge to air-cool the lower torso , commonly called " winnie the poohing . "
And that 's what she 's doing ?
Very much so .
That 's a nice vase .
Man , Will and Theresa would really miss that vase if anybody took it , which I 'm sure no one will .
Thank you .
It feels so great when you trust me .
I want to give you back your meat thermometer .
This is not mine , but thank you .
Don 't steal the vase .
Don 't steal the vase .
Don 't steal the vase .
Don 't steal the vase .
Don 't steal the vase .
Don 't steal the vase .
Hello ?
No .
Where 's Theresa ?
She sent me an e-mail asking me if I wanted to make pancakes with sting .
Obviously , yes , I do , but something just didn 't seem right .
Everything 's fine .
False alarm .
Go back to your witch farm .
Is that my egg chair ?
Did you take that out of my garage ?
No , that is my egg chair that you spitefully took in our divorce that you never use .
You told your friends I have kleptomania !
It 's nothing to be ashamed of .
It 's the most common mania to have , after wrestle and beatle .
What was that ?
That was Craig .
You know Craig .
The kids are back in bed .
Why are you here ?
Hello , Brenda .
I won 't insult your intelligence .
There 's some tomfoolery going on around here , and I 'm up to my ankles in it .
You ...
Brenda !
Theresa and I ... we were , uh , just out for a walk , but , she 's tired and so won 't be speaking .
Good evening , madam .
Your table is almost ready .
Except for that .
Well , good night .
Give us back our balls !
Hey , Will .
We got your back .
God .
Now what did you do ?
They told me everything .
We tried not to , but then she asked .
Look , Wonunol 's been tested extensively , and patients don 't remember a thing the next morning .
Of course , most of those patients were horses , but still , we should be fine as long as Brenda keeps her vodka chute shut .
Yeah , that 's winning me over .
Brenda , it would really be good if Theresa didn 't know that I talked her into taking an all-natural clydesdale roofie .
I won 't say a thing ...
Daddy , I threw up in my bed again !
Coming , honey !
I 'll even help with the kids , as long as assquatch gives me back my chair in its original condition before Theresa wakes up .
What ?
! No way .
That 's a terrible deal , guys .
Let 's walk .
Hey , wait .
Come on . Kenny !
You 're on the hook for this , too .
If Theresa finds out what happened , she will hold you down and force you to slap your own face , just like she did last Christmas .
Yeah , why wouldn 't that happen to me ?
Hey .
Did Will ask you to do that to his floor ?
No , I was looking for some tools so I could dismember my chair so my sister won 't make me slap myself in the face again !
Have you seen Gina ?
No !
Do you know how to clean paint off of a hardwood floor ?
! No !
See , you don 't like it when I yell at you .
Good thinking .
You got paint on the floor .
I knew I could count on you .
My God .
And some got on Theresa 's eye .
So I got a little paint on the painting .
That 's like spilling water in a swimming pool .
You 've got to fix this and restore the chair and clean the floor and find the kleptomaniac !
We got your back , Will .
And stop saying that !
What are you doing ?
Where 's Theresa ?
I don 't ... know .
I 'll tell you what .
You check the rest of the house .
I 'm gonna wait here for her .
Help me find her !
You 're leaving ?
Well , I have to .
You are really disappointing me a lot this evening , Craig .
That 's an ominous thing to say .
That 's not any better , is it ?
Nope , it 's worse .
So Gina is getting a little weird .
Really ? The kleptomaniac you met on the Internet is getting weird ?
Here .
You 're an artist .
Go get Nathan 's paints and fix this thing while I go look for Theresa , and you ... strip that chair down so that Brenda keeps her mouth shut .
Will 's house is kinda hectic at night , isn 't it ?
Yeah , I couldn 't live here .
Take that , you light-lovin ' ball thief !
Now I 'll never get my rake back ...
Or my longer rake .
Hey , I need an allen wrench so I can keep murdering my chair .
Take care of this while I get Theresa inside .
Rickshaw !
What ?
Goody .
Another task .
Okay , so Theresa 's sleeping again or ... still ... Or whatever the hell she 's been doing .
And I finished that painting . Hang on .
Great .
And I developed a pretty good move where I spin in a circle , firing indiscriminately .
I call it the " tornado of death , " so if you hear me yell , " tornado of death , " find a ditch and pray .
Maybe this will work out .
Brenda 's with the kids .
The game starts in five minutes .
I think we might have pulled this off , buddy .
Couple problems .
I 'm hoping they 're not related .
The painting has disappeared , and Gina 's car is gone .
Are ... are you kidding ?
That 's it .
I 'm dead .
Theresa 's gonna kill me .
No , Will .
The four of us are gonna go get that painting back .
But your precious video game is about to start .
This whole evening is my ... friend Kenny 's fault .
Should we forgive him ?
Don 't see how we can .
Should he be punished ?
Unmercifully .
I think what Craig is trying to say is , he brought the klepto over , and so the whole thing is his fault , and even though that is , without doubt or controversy , the only explanation for tonight ,
I 'm gonna help you , too .
I agree .
Kenny 's entirely to blame , and this conversation is over .
No restarts , infinity .
Even though I have no responsibility for any of this because I am in no way at fault , I want to help , too .
Again , summing up , grant ... helpful but blameless .
Now let 's do this .
Gina , honey ?
I think there may have been a misunderstanding about whose painting of Will 's family that is .
You hurt my feelings , Craig .
Go away .
Baby ...
Okay .
No more coddling .
Listen up , you psycho .
My God !
My beautiful eyes !
Kenny . Aah !
They 're ruined !
Guys , come on .
There 's an open window .
But what ...
I 'm going in !
Shh , Kenny !
No !
God !
Shh , Kenny ! Bees !
Rose-scented bees !
Kenny , no , shh !
It 's rosebushes !
Look , we need a ladder or ... or suits of leather or a-a japanese garden bridge .
That would be lovely .
Here 's what we 're gonna do .
I 'm gonna lie down .
You guys grab my arms and legs , swing me back and forth , build up some momentum , and then toss me as hard as you can .
I 'll twist in the air , grab the window , and pull myself in .
Any questions ?
Nobody ?
Really ?
Okay , I 'll go .
Are you insane ? !
Will , I can do this .
I did gymnastics in high school for , like , six weeks .
Watch .
God , you sound so nimble .
The trick is to let go of my arms a split second before you let go of my legs , so I twist in the air and I can grab the window frame with my hands .
Remember , arms and then legs .
It 's critical that you do it in that order .
Otherwise , this might not work .
Come on .
I 'll call it out .
All right .
Here .
Here , here , here .
Okay . Hey .
And ... swing .
And keep swinging .
Remember , it 's arms and then legs .
Here we go .
Two ... here it goes .
Arms , legs .
Arms , legs !
No !
Did he make it ?
Is he in ?
- Wrong !
That was wrong !
- Craig ?
Gentlemen .
What 's going on here tonight ?
How you doing , spider-man ?
Truthfully , I 'm in a lot of pain .
It was nice of Gina to give us the painting back .
The police made her give it back because she stole it because there 's a monkey in a wedding dress jumping on a trampoline where her brain should be .
She has a disease , Kenny .
Would you talk that way about somebody who had freckles or an itchy trigger finger or a case of the munchies ?
You don 't know what diseases are , do you , Craig ?
Guys , please .
I just had the worst night of my life .
All I want is one moment of quiet before I walk into my house and have the worst morning of my life .
Keen !
Get over here !
You said fix it .
It wouldn 't wash off .
You know anything about this , keen , huh ?
You know what , Glenn ?
I do know something about this , and if you had adjusted your stupid motion light , I never would have treated my wife like a horse and none of this would have happened , and , yes , that does make sense , so move the light and throw my kids ' balls back , or you are gonna find all kinds of crazy-ass things
painted all over your house .
You understand ?
Yeah .
Sure .
Good , and no more mowing your lawn in your khaki pants .
I don 't like it .
It 's weird .
Listen , last night when Gina took the painting , you guys really did have my back , so thank you .
Sure .
You got it .
It was worth it .
Plus I learned when you run into police in the middle of the night , it goes a whole lot smoother if you 're with a bunch of white dudes .
Well , here goes .
Put the painting in the hallway .
There they are .
Brenda told me everything .
Thank you for taking care of the kids and letting me sleep .
God , that pill really worked !
I feel so much better .
" Wonunol ... " " - Say ...
I gotta pop the sheets in the dryer .
You didn 't tell her ?
I love Theresa , and I figured it would break her heart if she found out what an idiot she married .
It would .
It really , really would ...
But where does she think we were ?
I told her you all got up early to clean out my garage , which you will be doing today .
Also , I hid all your adolescent crap around the side of the house , including the egg chair that you can keep , Kenny .
It was enough just to watch you destroy ... Your precious nerd capsule .
I shall rebuild it , and it shall be stronger , faster , with a sunroof and a thing to pee in .
Will , could you come here for a second ?
Look at my eye .
What happened ?
I have no idea ...
But I think your body type can handle it .
Get in the car !
Who are you ?
I 'm the man whose money you took .
He 'll get done , sooner or later .
I made a call .
There 's one thing nobody can escape from , it don 't matter how big a master criminal you are .
The VAT man .
Well done on bringing us the money .
Welcome to Morocco .
Help !
HELP !
For your own sake , I suggest you answer these questions truthfully .
Why are you on this boat ?
That 's ... er ... That 's all of us going on a fishing trip .
I remember that day ... happy times .
You are putting a bag in the car .
What was it ?
Probably fishing gear .
Bax ?
Quinn ?
Tell me about this , please .
Where did you learn how to do this ?
What is happening here ?
That 's ... that 's just lads on holiday , innit ?
You know , things get a bit out of control .
Hello ?
Who 's there ?
Hello ?
Who are you ?
Where are my friends ?
You all OK ?
They ... shaved me .
And they bust my new glasses .
Where are we ?
Said Morocco , didn 't they ?
Yeah , I know that .
But where ?
Did they show you the pictures ?
What pictures ?
What do you say to ' em Rick ?
Nothing . Obviously .
Don 't tell them anything , all right .
Not until we get some kind of legal representation .
Someone from the embassy - Amnesty or someone .
How you gonna get in touch with them ?
Who are they anyway ?
They 're some kind of militia or something , aren 't they ?
They knew we had that money .
They picked us off .
They 're probably using the money for some extremist movement .
So now we 're funding terrorists .
Oh , great .
This just gets better and better .
He was wearing a shirt , with a Marks and Spencer 's label on .
I saw it sticking out .
Who ?
My interrogator .
I mean , extremists ... They don 't shop at MS , do they ?
They might .
Shall we go and help him ?
Best not to get involved .
You all right , mate ?
It 's a woman .
Serious .
It 's a bird !
I was just trying to see if you were OK .
I 'm Quinn .
What sort of fag name is that ?
Dunno . Ask my dad .
Named after my grandfather , I think .
I 'm Mercedes .
Hi .
- Your dad into cars then ?
- Heard of the Count of Monte Cristo , dumb fuck ?
Yeah ... no ... yeah - fuck , I dunno , I can 't remember .
Can I just ask , what 's with all the rough stuff ?
It 's what they do if you don 't tell them what they want .
Who are they ?
A bunch of COCKSUCKERS !
Come on !
Do you have any idea how we might get in touch with someone from the British Government ?
Yeah , it 's easy .
They 're in there .
Eh ? What ?
It 's the Foreign Office .
Sorry . What is this place exactly ?
It 's where they bring people to question ... .. when they don 't want anyone to know they 're doing it .
Oh , great .
A week ago , I was standing in line , holding a tuna baguette , queuing up for easyJet .
Now I 'm being fucking renditioned !
" Dear God , please help me see danger coming my way , " and forgive the body count I will be sending your way . "
" Never pick up a dead man 's gun . "
" I ... " .. heart ...
" .. Bin Laden . "
Right .
We should go en masse and demand to speak to whoever 's in charge and make them understand they can 't just keep us here .
There 's laws and protocols ...
You think they 'll care about that ?
They still have to abide by them .
Says who ?
Woody , this is our government .
Governments can 't just hold us indefinitely for no reason .
What you on about ?
Course they can !
They do it all the time .
You remember those plane spotters in Greece ? You remember that ?
They said they were spies .
And what about Guantanamo ?
Nobody even knew who was in there . Get off !
Come on !
What ?
It takes two of ya ?
All right ?
How did you end up here then , love ?
I was in Kabul , " love " .
You in the army then ?
No , I went there because I like the opera .
Didn 't like what I saw , so I went AWOL .
Took a long fucking walk .
Posted some things on the web .
Things I thought people should see . Secrets ?
There are no secrets .
Only hidden truths .
Nah .
Just bitching about the food and the way they treat people .
Now they think I 'm bloody Wikileaks .
Dickheads .
How long do they usually keep people in here for ?
As long as they want .
That 's the point .
This place don 't exist .
Therefore , you don 't exist .
What did you all do anyway ?
Fellas , can I ... have a word ?
In private .
This could be a trick .
She could be working for them .
You not seen her face ?
They kicked her head in .
She 's trying to scare us and then befriend us , you know .
Get us to confess everything .
You got a point .
Oi , wuss-bags .
Just ignore her . Keep walking . Keep walking ...
What , you not talking to me now ?
I ain 't the enemy .
Anyway , if I wanted info out of you , I 'd just ... .
.. beat it out of you .
Get off me , you lunatic woman !
Ever had a cauliflower ear , Quinn ?
You know what Churchill said ?
Fuck off !
" If you 're going through hell , keep going " .
Tough it out , guys !
You can get through this .
You got each other for a start .
I 'm the one all on her lonesome .
Don 't see me walking around with the clown 's frown .
She 's got a point you know .
We 've really need to stay positive .
Good idea , Woody .
Tell you what , why don 't we see if they can organise basket weaving classes or something ?
Put our time to good use .
Only trying to help , knobhead .
Well , you 're not .
Saying " cheer up , it may never happen " doesn 't cut it .
So , what , do you think it 's somehow harder for you , Quinn ?
I don 't think anything , Bax .
Because I 'm stuck in an illegal prison in the middle of the Sahara fucking desert .
And why am I here ?
Because you persuaded me that a weekend away would be " a laugh " .
I persuaded you ?
You called me .
I 've never called you , Baxter .
I 've never called you because I cannot bear your incessant moaning and complaining .
Oh , right , great - thanks .
That 's nice .
Great time to get that out in the open .
You told me you came because Rick persuaded you .
Yup .
Here we go .
Here we go . Blame Rick .
Yeah , waiting for that one .
Shove it up your arse , Quinn .
You shove it up yours .
Nice toughing it out guys .
Oi , Quinnbo , you know there 's no " I " in team , don 't you ?
No .
But there 's a " U " in " fuck you " .
What 's going on ?
Stop it !
Get off ! Get off me !
No , please , I haven 't done anything .
Please don 't , please .
No ...
Woods ... !
Get your hands off him !
Rick !
Quinn !
Stop it !
Please ...
Baxter !
Bax , please ...
Help ! Get off !
What 's happening ?
Please , don 't .
Let go !
Where are you taking him ?
Leave him alone !
BAX !
Get your hands off him , you slags !
You bastards !
I watched the door all night to see if he 'd come out .
Yeah , me too .
Shit , no ...
Come on .
Let 's not think the worst .
I think there 's more grub on the side .
Just help yourself .
We 've been worried sick .
You 've been gone all night .
What happened ?
I dunno ... weird .
They asked me a bunch more questions and suddenly it was all , you know , tea and toast .
You should get some .
Come , please .
Oi ! Is it all right if I bring my tea , chief ?
Sit .
Fortunately for you ... .. we 're not actually interested in what you did over the last few days .
All we wanted to know was who you were financing .
We weren 't financing anyone .
We were just trying to get home .
With five million euros ?
We have at our disposal DNA databases , forensic analysis , satellite imaging technology .
If that doesn 't give us what we need , we employ enhanced interrogation techniques .
If we want to find out the truth , we do .
And now , we have .
We made a mistake .
It happens .
So ... You can go .
Just sign these and we 'll get you to the airport and on a flight .
Hang on .
Does that mean that we can ... ?
Please don 't ask if you can keep the money .
Do you want us to do anything for you , back home ?
Little candle-lit vigil ?
Coloured rubber wrist bands - " Free Mercedes " .
Take care .
Mrs Peters . 101 Bridge Road , Crawley .
It 's my mum .
Just let her know I 'm all right .
Don 't mention this , eh ?
You take care of yourself .
Seriously ?
Did you really think we were going to get out of there ?
Two nights in . Nah ... thought that was it .
What went through your mind ?
Well , first of all , my kids ...
Carmen , and then just like , stupid stuff , like ...
I thought I 'd never get to see United play again .
I kept thinking of my kids .
Kept seeing their little faces .
Then I thought about Nina ... .
I started to think about all the things they 'd find out about me , you know , when I was dead .
And what if they stopped loving me ?
I wouldn 't be there to tell them that that 's not what I 'm like .
Be honest , kid , you were worried about her finding your porno collection .
Nah , I don 't know .
Things that might be misinterpreted .
You know , e-mails , receipts .
Yeah , I didn 't think of that .
I wonder what people would really make of all this back home ?
They might wonder why four grown men went on holiday together , saying they were going to Spain and actually ending up in Morocco .
If anyone so much as mentions " bad luck " , they 're walking .
Be a long walk back , pal , we 've been driving for nearly an hour .
Haven 't seen so much as a camel .
He 's gone .
He 's not coming back , is he ?
Two stay , two go and get help .
Shouldn 't we all go ?
Why ?
Or stay ?
We 'll double our chances if we split .
Halve them you mean .
Who wants to stay ?
I do .
I do .
I do .
I 'll go .
Come on .
You two stay here , if the driver comes back , just all stay with the car , all right ?
Do you believe in destiny , Bax ?
No .
So shut up .
Fate then ?
Rick , please .
No destiny , no fate , no karma , no spells , no curses .
This is just a series of misunderstandings , OK ?
Could have happened to anybody .
No more , no less .
Who 's ... ?
Come on !
Get in .
You are about to be shot , get in !
Bax , get in .
Woods !
Quinn !
Hey !
Slow down , slow down .
- We had some disturbing intel .
- Well , if it 's bad news can you just lie to me ?
I 'd like to know what 's going on , please .
A covert department of the CIA , the Special Activities Division has activated a kill contract on you .
Sorry ?
What are you talking about ?
Evidently , you 've intersected a line of narco-finance and ...
Wait .
Stop . Hang on .
Now this might be because of the sun and this whole desert , shot at scenario thing but I 'm just finding it a little hard to concentrate .
Would you mind talking to me as if I 'm five years old ?
Your man in Majorca ... .. has operated successfully for so long because he gives huge kickbacks to the American security services .
What ?
He 's paying the CIA to protect him ?
Narco-finance is a major revenue stream - for American black ops .
- Like a five-year-old , please .
Dirty tricks .
Security activities they don 't want people to know about .
Drugs deals have been financing dodgy US foreign policy for years .
Not really new news .
Why would they want to kill us ?
One of you tipped off the authorities in the UK .
A contact inside Customs and Excise .
Your man here retaliated by telling the Special Activities Division you were about to blow their op wide open .
So now they have to take you out .
No , this ... this is crazy . I mean ...
Why can 't you just tell them , all right , that we 're not the people that they think we are ?
This goes higher than us .
This kind of thing brings down governments .
Iran Contra anyone ?
Which is why removing you is an easy piece of damage limitation .
They can 't just shoot four blokes who just happened to go on holiday together .
Under the aegis of " the global war on terror " , they can shoot anyone they like .
And do .
That 's who shot at us ?
The CIA ? No .
They 'd have tasked local contractors .
So nothing can be linked back to them .
You got lucky ...
But this isn 't going to go away .
OK , let 's get practical , then .
So what are the options ?
Well , there must be something ?
Right ...
Right - there may be a solution but we have to act now .
Like , this minute .
Your presence here is getting a little itchy for us .
Excuse us for the inconvenience !
We may be able to get you out . Take you to another country . New identities .
Then what ?
Then I 'm afraid you 're on your own .
How long would this be for ?
Maybe for ever .
- We can never go home ?
- It 's the only offer on the table .
No , no , no , that 's ...
That 's not an option .
No .
I 'm going home and ...
If you go back , you 'll be putting your families at risk as well .
That is a guarantee .
OK , let me just see if this is even logistically possible .
Stand up .
Get up .
OK .
We can do it .
We have a scrambled phone link .
You can each of you make one phone call home but you must not , under any circumstances , tell them where you are and what is happening .
Amy ...
Yeah , I know , I 'm sorry that I haven 't rung .
Listen to me for a second , love .
Nina ...
Just stop , just let me talk , darling , OK ?
Right ...
There 's no easy way of saying this , OK , so I 'm just going to say it straight out .
I 'm not coming back .
Wait , wait , wait -
I don 't know who to phone .
Well , I do , I want to speak to my kids , but I don 't know which one to choose .
If I 've only got one call , which one do I call ?
You can 't make me choose .
I need you to phone my folks , I want you to tell them that I 'm fine and everything 's OK , that I 'm just going to go travelling for a little bit .
Rachel , are the girls with you ?
Where are they ?
Shit ...
I want you to tell the girls that I love them both very much ...
I don 't know how long .
I know , I 'm sorry .
Just please , please ... Don 't let them think that I 've abandoned them ... .. because that is not what 's happened .
I 've met someone .
Oh , Amy ...
Please , just tell the kids , OK , that it 's not because of them ,
I 'm sorry Nina .
I 'm really sorry .
Dad , it 's me .
Yeah , no , I know , I thought I 'd be back by now as well .
No , no , everything 's fine . It 's just ... I think I 'm going to stay out here a little longer .
What ?
Well , what happened to your satellite dish ?
I can 't hear you Rachel , say that again .
Take care ?
Yeah , OK .
I will .
You too .
Go back to the shop where you bought it from , right , and ask someone there to help you , they 'll help you .
Well , it 's just because I don 't know when I 'm going to be back , Dad .
Fuck ...
No , no , you 're right , I 'm sorry , I know I shouldn 't swear .
Dad , listen to me , OK ?
You 've been brilliant , Dad .
Yeah , just take care .
Yeah ...
I love you , Dad . Take care .
Bye-bye .
Bye .
I know you all think it 's my fault , don 't you ?
You think it 's my fault because I phoned the VAT man .
It 's nobody 's fault , Rick .
It 's just ...
I don 't know , the universe conspiring against us or something .
And has been since we set foot in Alvo 's villa .
A fly saved my life .
What ?
Out in the desert .
If it hadn 't been for that fly , I 'd have had my head blown off .
And the weird thing was , we 'd met before . We 'd ... .. bonded .
Four hours now .
How far are we going ?
Any idea where we 're going yet ?
Is that a don 't know , or won 't say ?
Bax ?
What you going to call yourself ?
What do you mean ?
Your name .
We can 't use our own names right ?
Hey ...
I 'm gonna be Floyd .
That 's what I 'm gonna call myself .
Floyd ...
Floyd Carter .
You can 't call yourself that .
Why ?
It 's a black name .
Is it ?
It 's like calling yourself ... Everton or Tyrell , or something .
You can 't .
Needs to be something ordinary ...
Tony .
Tony Smith .
My name 's Tony ... Smith .
Why can 't I be Tony Smith ?
You call yourself whatever you like , mate .
Sir Tony Smith if you want , mate .
We should call ourselves names that mean something .
You know , like the native Americans do .
I 'll be Running Scared .
I 'll be ...
Mr Dances With Wolves .
No , I mean something ... Something with hope in it . You know , like ...
If I was a girl , I 'd call myself ... .. well , Hope .
You could be Bob Hope .
New hope .
New house .
Aaron ... no , Adam .
Adam Newhouse .
James ...
Kirk .
Jamie ... . Jamie Kirk , then .
Blake ...
Lin ...
Blake ...
Hee ...
Ha ...
Hatch .
Blake Hatch .
Tony Smith , Adam Newhouse , Jamie Kirk and ... .. Blake Hatch .
Welcome to your new fucking lives .
Where are we ?
South Africa .
We 're on the other side of the world .
Do they speak English here ? Uh ...
I think so .
What 's it like ?
I don 't know .
This will all sort out , won 't it ? Eh ?
A week from now , we 'll be in a pub in London , we 'll be laughing about this .
Some rand to get you through the first few weeks .
A driving licence form and some other ID stuff you 'll need to fill in .
How do we get in touch with you ?
You don 't .
Right , OK .
- How do we keep in touch ? - You won 't be able to .
It 's too dangerous .
Hang on a minute .
What happens if it 's safe for us , if it becomes safe for us to go home , to break cover ?
How will we know that ?
As far as anyone else knows now , you don 't exist .
That 's your best chance of surviving .
If you want to stay alive , stay invisible .
The truth will come out though , won 't it ? In the end .
OK , let 's go .
Say your goodbyes .
Come on , move this thing along .
Come on , people .
This isn 't a secure area .
Take care of yourselves .
Woody .
Hey , we shouldn 't be on our own .
Listen , I know I said some things ... .. but you boys mean a lot to me , all right ? And you always will .
Quinn , Quinn , come on .
Guys , come on , we should stay together , yeah ?
We 're a team now .
We 're a team , we 're like a band of brothers .
Rick , Rick ... all right , you 'll be OK .
You 'll be OK .
Right , boys ...
Chin up .
At least we 're still standing , eh ?
You 'll be all right , Bax .
What makes you say that ?
You 're smart .
I 'm not that fucking smart .
Good luck .
Hey . What about if just me and him , we stick together ?
- It 'll be all right , won 't it ?
- No .
- Listen , nobody has to know .
- It 's for your own good .
You 'll be all right .
I can 't do this Woody .
Yes , you can .
No , I can 't !
You 're strong , mate .
You 're stronger than you think .
No , I 'm not .
I 'm not , Woods , I 'm not strong .
I 'm not strong at all .
Woods , let 's not do it , yeah ?
You and me , we 'll stay together , yeah ?
Woods ...
Woody ...
Woody , let me go with you , yeah ?
Please , Woody .
Woody , let me come with you , please .
Hey !
You 've got to be a man about it .
I 've got to look after myself .
I 'm not your fucking boyfriend .
Woody ...
Woody , I don 't want to be on my own !
Woody , please .
Woody !
Woody , mate .
Don 't leave me , please .
Woody !
Please , mate , don 't leave me here .
Woody ...
Woody ...
Woody !
WOODY !
I know every disgraced politician , every gem smuggler , every high-stakes gambler and gold digger that come through those doors .
Why you never go away ?
You don 't even leave Cape Town .
If you love her so much , why don 't you marry her ?
Yeah , why don 't you marry me and take me to England ?
Your name isn 't Newhouse is it ?
How dare you , and how dare you try and blackmail me !
Help !
Previously on Siberia ...
A tiger !
A fucking tiger !
I couldn 't believe it .
It was like something a seven year old would tell me ... " Oh , I saw a tiger in the woods ... "
- What are you doing ?
- Wondering what would do that to a tiger .
Oh , hell .
It 's on fire ... and it 's green ...
- What 's on fire ?
- The sky .
You know , there 's something about Carolina .
I feel like I recognize her .
- Fire in the woods , man .
- Got to get some water .
I told you this was a mistake !
That 's all we had , man .
That 's all we had .
Does anyone recognize this ?
We found Johnny 's shirt .
And it was full of food from the shed .
I get what it looks like . I see that . But I didn 't steal the food , and I didn 't burn down the shed .
Someone obviously doesn 't like me , and they 're trying to set me up .
People weren 't taking too kindly me being at camp 'cause apparently I stole food from the shed and then burned it down .
Someone framed me .
They wrapped my shirt around some food , hid it in the woods .
I don 't know who did it .
You know , frankly , I don 't really care anymore , you know ?
I don 't really need them anyways .
You know , obviously , I can take care of myself .
Took them how long to build a fire ?
I did it in five minutes in the dark .
I can 't believe Johnny 's gonna just stay out in the woods .
That 's crazy .
And why shouldn 't he ? After all the crap that he 's pulled ?
He 'll be fine .
And if he 's not , you got a better chance of winning .
And you can keep his bed .
I want to make it to the end , but I want to do it as a team , kind of like how Neeko 's doing it , you know ?
Can I tell you something ?
Sure .
You 're a smart guy .
You know that Neeko is a professional athlete ?
He plays game for living .
How about maybe he 's playing this game that he 's a very nice guy , everybody trusts him , just to win the game ?
Have you ever thought about it ?
I don 't think you should trust him .
Can 't trust anybody .
Guys ?
I get up early , and as soon as I open the door , I practically ran into this spear that 's stuck in the ground .
It felt like a threat .
Let me see .
What does it say ?
It says ...
What is that ?
It means " get out . "
It 's just another thing to throw on the pile of what the hell 's going on here .
It 's a nice prop .
Look at it .
It 's not real .
Nice scare tactic .
They 're watching .
I 'm sure they 're loving this .
Why is it in front of our cabin and not yours ?
Who wants you guys to get out ?
Well , this is here on purpose .
That 's for sure . It 's here on purpose .
It 's here for a reason . You guys gonna be so gullible to fall for this , really ?
Who else could 've left that spear ? Besides Production , who could 've done it ?
We 're the only people out here .
Aren 't we ?
- Are you okay ?
- I 'm fine .
I mean , aren 't you still scared ?
The spear this morning telling us to leave ? That doesn 't scare you at all ?
I think , at this point , it 's just all mind games .
I miss home . I miss my family . I even miss my stupid ex-boyfriend .
This place is- - it 's getting to me .
I don 't know .
I 'm thinking about pushing the button .
I don 't want you to go .
You know what I mean ?
I think- - I think we can win this .
We just need to- -
But I don 't need to stay .
I don 't understand why I 'm even staying . I don 't need the money that badly .
I do .
Annie .
I 've been a lone wolf for a while , you know ?
I 've been on my own for a while .
I 'm probably , without knowing it , less lonely than I have been in a long time because I 'm interacting with people more often than I have in many years .
Now I consider Daniel a friend .
He 's a good kid .
If I had a son , I 'd be proud if he was like Daniel .
What are you looking at ?
- Just watching those two . - Mm-hmm .
I don 't want to overstep my bounds , you know .
I don 't know how she feels about me , and so I 'm just kind of- -
I 'm taking it slow , but at the same time , it 's really hard 'cause I really want to , you know , see where this is gonna go .
I don 't know .
At the same time , I don 't want to get hurt .
Don 't worry . She knows you exist .
How would I really get her to ?
I don 't know , like ...
Get her to what ?
Like me like me .
You can 't get her to like you .
Either she does or she doesn 't .
You know ?
How beautiful is it ?
This is so nice .
_
Why not ?
_
I 'm sorry . I 'm being naughty .
It 's beautiful in , though .
_
You must be hot .
Come on .
_ - No good ... _ _
- No one 's here .
- It 's trouble .
No one 's here .
I 'm not gonna tell anyone .
You want to come .
- Oh , yeah ?
_
You 'll thank me once you 're in here .
It 's beautiful .
_
_
I 'm gonna film us .
_
It 's a great idea .
You promise you 'll erase it ?
_
- Promise me ?
- I promise .
Good .
Annie ?
Wait , Annie .
You shouldn 't be walking out here alone .
It 's not safe .
_
What are you talking about ?
Come on , it 's not safe .
Stop . Wait .
Don 't be like this .
Be like what ?
Look , I- -
It 's not the same thing for me , okay ?
I 'm not going back to a life or a job that I like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend , and I get that you 're sad about that .
But you 're forgetting about who 's here for you right now , and you 're turning your back on me .
No , I 'm not .
I like her .
It 's been a while since I 've been with anybody , but I- - We get along so well .
I just feel like a dumbass now .
I mean , she 's probably not gonna talk to me for the rest of the time , if she does stay .
- Hey . - There you are .
- How 's it going ?
Good .
I just wanted to talk to you .
Uh-huh ? Um , so , Victoria 's gone . Um , I 'm just wondering what 's going on with her bed .
Oh , it 's- - well , it 's free right now .
So no one would mind if I moved in ?
I mean , I don 't mind .
I don 't know what the other girls other think , but it 's good with me .
Awesome .
All right , I 'll go grab my things .
It 's not that I didn 't have fun with the boys . I don 't know . I just feel like my time there is done .
It 's served its purpose , and I want to- -
I want to get to know the girls a bit better .
- Hey . - What are you doing ?
- I 'm leaving .
You mean the show ?
No , you idiot .
I 'm gonna move into Victoria 's old bed .
Wait .
Why ?
Why ? Because it 's free .
I know , but I thought you liked it here with me .
You said we are great roommates .
Yes , we were , and thank you for letting me stay .
Just , I don 't know . I want to be with the girls now .
Come on , Esther .
Don 't you think we should team up ?
We are both smarter than everyone else here .
We can win this thing- - together .
Ohh , I like your style .
I will think about it .
But hold on . Hold on .
Hold on . I was just thinking that we could have something ...
You thought what ?
That we could get romantic a little bit ?
Don 't laugh .
Really ? I don 't do romance .
Look , we 're playing a game .
What do you mean ?
I 'm playing a game- - for money .
I don 't do romance , and I 'm not playing a dating game .
I 'm sorry .
You 're not going anywhere .
Get the fuck off me !
I 'm kidding .
I was just kidding , Esther .
I 'm just kidding . Esther .
Don 't you fucking touch me again .
Come on ! I 'm just-
- I was just kidding !
I think I was in shock . I-I don 't know .
It happened so quickly .
But he grabbed me here , pushed me up against the bunk , and then he backed off . Esther is a player .
We all know that .
And I played with her , too . So she was on the way out .
I just pushed her a little bit on the bed , just jokingly , like pretending that I 'm like scaring her .
" You 're gonna stay here , " or something .
She just , like , freaked out . She pushed me away .
She 's like , " don 't talk to me like that . "
Stormed out , like mad .
And I was just telling her , " I 'm joking . You know me .
I always joke around .
I was just joking with you . " I didn 't get it , seriously .
She just freaked out , and it was just a pure joke .
What are you showing me ? It was right here .
Are you sure ?
Big huge carcass .
Guts hanging out and everything .
Look .
Look at what ? The blood ?
It could 've been anything . It could 've been a bird .
It could 've been a deer . Why would I make this up ?
Why would I lie ?
There was a huge- - there was a huge tiger there .
I guess they took it .
The producers took it .
The producers ?
I think she thinks that I could 've been trying to scare her , play a sick joke on her .
I was kind of a bit shocked because I didn 't think she saw me as that kind of person . For all I know , Johnny took it .
Johnny took it ?
He probably dragged it off into there and hid it or something .
I don 't know .
Oh , now Johnny does everything ?
Not only do we have to worry about the producers playing mind games with us , we got to worry about that guy .
Hopefully he 's done us all a favor and gone and pushed the button to get out of here . I don 't think he 's as bad as you think .
Why are you always defending him ? Why are you always defending him ?
I 'm telling you that guy 's dangerous .
You need to watch yourself !
I 'm kind of baffled where it 's gone , you know , 'cause this thing was pretty big , you know .
It would 've taken a lot of force or something pretty hefty to get it out of there , and there was no trail .
There was no kind of like a trail of where it could 've been dragged to .
It 's like it was almost picked up and gone .
Got some traps set up along this way somewhere . I found some deer trails I scouted earlier .
Hope they catch something .
The first night in the woods by myself was pretty awesome , actually . Had a nice little fire .
Weather was nice .
You know , wrapped up .
It was nice being on my own .
It 's what I wanted to do originally , too , is , you know , be by myself , take care of myself , do my own thing , and I got that , so pretty content .
What the hell did this , man ? This thing 's ...
I mean , it , obviously , it ripped the deer while it was standing here . It was strong enough to rip it off- - rip the , like , rip its bone in half .
What do you want ?
What are you doing ?
I 'm trying to catch some food , but something got to it before me , it looks like .
What do you want ?
I just came to try to convince you to come back .
Try to convince me to come back , to the camp ?
Yeah , I don 't think it 's safe for you to be out here .
I think it 's safer here than being back at camp where a bunch of people don 't like me thanks to you , making those wild accusations . Just , whatever happened ,
I don 't think it 's safe for you to stay out here . Well , you know what ?
I really don 't need you trying to be nice to me .
I 'll be fine on my own , okay ?
I can take care of myself .
Y 'all try taking care of yourselves , too , all right ?
Okay , fine .
If that 's how you want to be , then fine . Fine .
Nah , that 's- - that 's not good enough .
That ain 't good enough .
Hey , Irene .
Hey , Dan . Whatcha doing ?
Collecting some acorns .
If you mash them up , you can make like a paste and make a pancake out of it .
- Really ? - Yeah .
Is it- - does it taste good ?
I think so .
You want me to help ? Oh , sure .
That 'd be great . Yeah .
They 're kind of scattered all over .
Daniel is a really , really nice , really sweet person , and he has such a gentle- - a very gentle spirit ,
It 's a Siberian squill .
I 'm not really big on flowers .
Why not ?
Well , you know , they 're pretty , but it 's kind of odd , the whole idea of someone giving someone a flower 'cause it 's like , " Oh , you know , I like you , so let me give you something that 's dying . "
It never really made sense to me .
Something more permanent would be nice , you know , even a rock would be better .
She 's got so much complexity to her , you know ?
I find out something new about her every day , it seems like , and it 's a pretty big thing that I would 've never expected out of her .
She 's just- - she 's amazing .
Where are we ?
I can 't find the path .
We 're lost .
- We 're not lost . - No , we 're lost .
I don 't know where we 're going .
In the middle of the wood , very close to the river , I found this really weird-looking tree .
I mean , it wasn 't a tree .
It was something different .
It had a face shape . It had hair .
What ? My name is Miljan .
It 's really nice to meet you .
What is your name ? Ogdee ?
This is my friend Ogdee .
We go way back , man .
He 's so bad .
I spoke to it .
We had a little conversation .
Ogdee is my old friend from high school .
I 'm kidding .
Esther .
- What ?
_
_
_ _
_
_
_
_ _
_
_
_ _
_
_ _
_
Hey .
Where have you been ? Out .
Out ?
Where do you go all day , anyway ?
Okay .
I can 't believe you got us so lost .
We 're not lost .
Yes , we are . Where are we ?
Do you know where we are ?
We 're in Siberia .
Not funny .
Oh , God !
What is that ?
Did you hear that ?
I heard it . Come on .
There might be something out here . Come on .
Oh ! Oh , God !
What are you doing out here ?
Sorry . I 'm going to get water .
Where are you going ?
Home- - where the hell is it ?
That way .
Why is she being such a bitch ?
Why are you here , by the way , alone ?
No reason .
That 's suspicious .
Shut up , Miljan .
Guys , have you seen Carolina ?
No . She hasn 't come back .
You mean she 's not back yet ?
She 's not back . I have no idea where she is .
I haven 't seen her .
You do know she 's out there with Johnny ?
Yeah , tell me about it . I know .
Well , I don 't know about you , but I feel like I should go and look for her .
I don 't- - I don 't feel comfortable with her with Johnny .
Before it gets too late , I think we should .
I 'm game , yeah .
- You 're gonna come with me ?
- Yeah .
Gentlemen .
Where the hell were you ?
I was in the woods .
Have you seen Carolina ?
She 's out there with Johnny .
Oh , she 'll be fine , guys .
- Come on . - Are you serious ? Yes .
They 're probably having sex or something .
Oh , you 're a funny guy .
Don 't be naive .
You didn 't notice the chemistry they had ?
Hey , guys , listen .
I 'm gonna look for her . I don 't know about you .
Just sitting here talking .
Hey , it 's dark outside .
Oh , fuck !
Get on the bed . Get onto the bed !
The bed ?
Oh , my God .
What is this ?
The cab started shaking ...
Ran outside , and the sky this just this odd color that I 've never seen in my life , and I 'm thinking it can 't be the show doing this because that 's way out of their powers and their control .
It 's like- - it 's like the sky 's on fire .
What ?
It 's like the sky 's on fire .
The sky went from dark to light , and it looked like it was on fire , just like Victoria said .
If this is all part of the game , it 's beyond me at this point .
I don 't understand how they could pull it off .
I feel like I 'm on another planet .
I feel like I walked into some kind of a dream or a nightmare , and nobody- - nobody has any answers . I don 't have an answer .
I could sit here all day long and just- - it 's way above my pay scale .
- Is it moving ?
- It just keeps moving .
Carolina never came back today , did she ? Yeah . Where- - where are they ?
She 's still in the woods- - the forest .
Well , this can 't stop us .
We still have to find her .
We can 't leave her out there .
We better go now .
We 're just gonna go look for her- - me and Sam , Daniel , Miljan as well .
Oh , my God .
Carolina ?
Carolina . Are you okay ?
What happened ? Oh , my God .
Carolina !
- What happened ?
Are you okay ?
- Are you okay ?
Then we see Carolina stumbling towards the girls ' cabin , and the girls go rushing over to her .
Are you hurt somewhere ?
- What happened ?
- Look at all the blood . What happened ?
She 's bleeding .
Guys , don 't , don 't- - don 't go to her . Back up .
Oh , my God , look at her arm .
Look at her arm .
What happened to you ? You 're okay .
Carolina , what happened ?
Carolina shows up , and she 's battered and disoriented .
She couldn 't even speak . She 's trembling .
I don 't ...
She doesn 't remember .
You don 't remember ?
What do you remember ?
She didn 't know what was going on .
She was saying she couldn 't even , like , remember what she 'd been doing out there .
She was just talking nonsense , and it was really jolting to see her come back like that .
_
You were with John ?
- And what happened ?
- Where is he ?
What were you doing with Johnny ? Get her some water .
Get her some help .
Carolina , were you with Johnny ? She said she was .
What were you doing with Johnny ?
_
_
She said the name " Johnny . "
At that point , I just , you know , lost it . Listen to me .
Listen to me . Listen to me . For what ?
Here , just come here .
Come here .
I want to say something to you . - What ?
- Listen to me !
It 's important .
You got to make sure .
You look at his hands . Okay .
His hands are a tell-tale sign , okay ?
His hands will tell you if he did something . What are you doing ?
Where are you going ?
Stay here with the girls .
Stay here with the girls !
I 'm not wasting any more time with this guy .
Everyone wants to keep him around , thinking , " Oh , yeah , he 'll turn around and be a good guy . "
No , I don 't think so .
I 'm not gonna lay around waiting for him to come stab me in the back .
- She 's been through a lot . - Yeah .
We 're gonna look after you , okay ? Don 't worry .
We don 't know where Johnny is .
Carolina sort of- - she couldn 't say much , but she said that she was- - they were fighting- - her and Johnny were fighting .
And then , now she looks like this , so Johnny should be probably fearing for his life right now because Sam and Neeko went after him .
Let 's just keep moving .
Move . Move .
_
The whole walking through the woods and hearing noises coming from places that , you know- -
We stop and we look , and there 's nothing there .
It 's just this whole atmosphere that everything just feels like you 're being watched , you know .
Whether , you know , whether you 're in the woods or in the cabin , you always feel like something is watching you , and the past two nights ,
I haven 't slept very well , you know .
So I 'm just- - you know , you 're always looking over your shoulder .
You always think something 's there , and , like , the whole thing with the sky now ...
I don 't know .
Well , he 's obviously around here somewhere .
Yes . You keep saying " he , " " he . "
Look how thick the brush is here .
If there 's somebody around here , we 'd see them .
We hear other things .
All of a sudden , something goes flying .
I think we should be talking more in the sense of " what . "
I 'll go see if the water 's boiled .
Thank you .
I don 't want to die .
I didn 't ever expect that that would be a possibility on this show , and every day that I 'm here ,
I feel like I 'm an idiot for staying , that I am gonna end up like Tommy .
I don 't deal well with- - Abuse is not something that ... I can handle right now .
I 'm scared .
And Johnny was already on the outs with the group for stealing food .
I just- - How could he do that to her ?
It didn 't make sense .
She 's such a nice lady .
Johnny .
Hey . What did you do ?
- Huh ? - What did you do to Carolina ?
I don 't know what you 're talking about .
What do you mean you don 't know what I 'm talking about ?
- What 'd you do to her ? - I didn 't- -
She 's all cut up and shit .
I don 't- - I don 't know . I ...
What 's wrong with you ?
I don 't know . I just-
- I kind of came to . I was walking around , and ...
I don 't know . I was- - I saw her .
You saw her where ?
You got to tell me what happened .
We were in the woods , and ... I don 't really- - I don 't really remember .
I get approached by Daniel , and basically started accusing me of hurting Carolina .
I didn 't know what to say .
What did you to do her ?
! The last thing she remembers is getting in a fight with you , so you can 't come back here and tell me that you didn 't touch her !
I don 't .
Then what happened to her ?
I don 't know .
That 's not a very good answer right now , man .
I don 't- - trust me .
Hey . You hear that ?
At the camp .
Let 's go .
I don 't know .
Are you serious ? You don 't know ?
You 're such a scumbag .
Oh , what ?
So she just fell down and ended up that way ?
Are you kidding me ?
I was in a complete haze .
I had no recollection .
I was like blacked out , like I drank too much .
He doesn 't look like he knows what 's going on . I don 't .
- Then what happened to her ?
- I don 't know .
I don 't know .
You were together , weren 't you ? - You said that .
- Shit !
Neeko !
Neeko !
Guys , he doesn 't know !
- Motherfucker ! - Come on !
Stop it ! - Stop !
Stop it ! - Come on ! Stop it !
He didn 't do it ! Carolina starts screaming , " It 's not him .
He didn 't do it . "
Stop it !
What do you mean ? You said you don 't remember .
You said you don 't remember .
You 're a dead man . You 're a fucking dead man .
Listen . Listen .
Hey , hey . Hey !
Calm down .
Listen . - What happened ?
- I don 't know .
Talk to me .
I don 't know .
Johnny doesn 't know anything ?
He doesn 't remember anything .
It was just her and him in the forest .
I know that . I know that . I saw it in his eyes , okay ?
All I remember is I talked to her .
We were arguing .
And then I-I came here , and I started getting accused , and I don 't even know what the fuck is going on . If we caught him in the woods , he would 've been dead .
When I saw that look in his eyes ,
I just felt that I needed to take a step back . Remember the way she came into camp ?
He 's got the same look on his face . Does she remember anything ?
Show us your hands .
I 've seen that before .
What 's that from ?
Nothing 's making sense here .
And just to be angry and become a bunch of animals- -
We can 't go killing each other .
We 're still human beings .
I don 't like things that I can 't explain and that I don 't have at least some sort of control over .
The sky changing color and looking like fire- - the producers , the show can 't do that .
We 're talking supernatural stuff now .
Regardless of everything else , that 's real , and that scared the hell out of me .
It seems like everybody at camp was convinced that I was the person that hurt her . I 've never hit a woman in my life .
I don 't know why I would .
I don 't remember anything , but ...
I can 't say that I didn 't 'cause I don 't- - I don 't know what happened . But I know in my heart I wouldn 't do that .
All I remember is that I was ... with- -
Went to get Johnny . He was in the woods .
I found him , and I ...
It 's all one big blur , like one big blackout .
I have all these marks on my body , and my shirt is broken , and I don 't remember . I don 't understand .
So you 're telling me this is real . Yes .
It looks like it 's native , handmade .
It looks like it 's just a prop to me .
Well , if it 's a prop , it 's really well-made 'cause you see the barbs .
That 's exactly how it should look .
This is ox .
It 's real ox .
And it 's balanced for throwing .
It just looks perfect .
It 's your choice to believe in it or not , but this is real , so ...
I don 't have to deal with lies in figuring out what is true , what is not . I have to know the environment I 'm in .
I have to know what 's out there in order to protect myself and survive .
Look at this . So , I found this symbol that is really strange .
It has four lines and little triangles on the ends .
Then I found another one and another one , and I realized it 's a path . I should follow them .
At the end , it was very close to the settlement .
I found the last one .
And I found this box .
It was a metal box . I opened it , and it was a book .
I didn 't understand anything because it was in a different language .
I would assume it 's Russian because it 's cyrillic letters .
It was a person . He 's staring at me . And he just disappeared in a second .
So there are people out there .
I was just gonna try and make things better , and , like , apologize , and just wanted to let her know that I didn 't , you know , I didn 't want to screw anything up or make anything awkward for her .
I guess I was in a weird mood , and I just want to apologize because I don 't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything , because I 'm really glad you 're- -
When I realized what Annie 's real feelings were for me ,
I just thought ... " I 'm sort of open to love in any form right now . "
So I kissed her .
Which I kind of surprised myself at , to be honest .
I 'm okay . You ?
I wanted to go check on her to see how she was doing 'cause I knew she had scratches and stuff on her , and she was sure freaked out like I was .
Do you remember anything from last night ?
No .
I don 't remember anything either .
But I know you didn 't hurt me .
♪ people in life , they will come and go ♪ ♪ like the boats sailing by my door ♪

Why 'd you set me up ?
With the shed and the food ?
She couldn 't even look me in the eye .
And I was like , " Well ... " I was like , " It tells me all I need to know , "
so I was like- - got the hell out of there . Johnny .
Stop , please . Johnny , wait for me .
- Give me a break . Oh , my God .
- Hey . I know that .
I know that . - Johnny .
- I know that . You 're an actress .
She said , like , this slogan .
Like , " I know that .
I know that from somewhere . "
And then it just- - the light bulb went off .
Yeah , that 's like your slogan .
She 's that actress from that show that- -
I 'm like , " That 's how I know you . "
I didn 't want to do that . I didn 't want-
- I asked them . You didn 't want to do what ?
I didn 't want to burn it down . I didn 't want to set you up .
They told me to .
Who 's they ?
The producers .
So you 're- - you 're helping the show ?
Episode 1
Tae Yang !
Tae Yang !
( yang = a title meaning " young miss " )
Miss Tae .
Yes ?
This afternoon , Room 404 left again .
Go clean up .
Room 404 ?
I don 't understand why that room can 't go for long without being vacated .
Is the chest of drawers unlucky ?
Tae Yang , take the dresser from that room out , too .
Yes .
Pretend you didn 't see .
Pretend you didn 't see .
Mom !
Go away !
I told you to go !
Excuse me .
A grandmother told me to give you this money .
Our mother ?
This money ...
It 's ten million won !
It really is !
Omo !
She said to use it to help fund the funeral and use the rest to pay off your debt .
Mother .
There was also something else she wanted me to tell you .
Please , tell me .
You rotten bastard !
If you ever touch gambling again , I 'll come and cut your hand off , you bastard !
Don 't gamble anymore !
Is what she said .
It really is mom 's account book .
My word , ten million won .
How did she have this money ?
Give it to me .
That 's not all yours , half of it is mine .
How is it yours ?
Mother told her to deliver this to me !
Why ?
So you 'll take this , too , after using everything else ?
Half of it is mine !
What did you do to deserve half ?
What did you ever do for mom ?
Then what did you ever do ?
You lost and sold everything by gambling !
You even took my depos ... house deposit and I got divorced because of that !
Was your divorce my responsibility !
? Was it my fault ?
Of course it 's your fault !
Who else 's would it be !
It 's was your fault ! That 's why my fingers got chopped off !
Is your finger getting cut off my fault ?
Fine , then .
Hit me with that hand !
Hit me !
Aish !
Real ...
It 's not like you did anything right , Miss , to be yelling at Oppa ?
! Unnie , you have no right to say that !
Who was the one who told him to co-sign !
? Omo !
Then do we leave Oppa to die ?
For now , we have to save him at least .
I 'm so sick of all this , really !
Be quiet !
It 's not his fault !
Miss !
As if you were ever good to us ... for you to come and take it all ? !
You 're saying that there is a dead spirit here right now ?
That 's right .
My dead wife is still here .
I 've thought about the kids , and I 've even thought about selling the house .
But that is not what my dead wife would have wanted .
So you 'll remain as a stumbling block in the middle of my golf course ?
Fine , let 's negotiate .
If my wife is here right now , how can I drive her away ?
The dead person is here ?
Fine .
If she 's really here , let 's negotiate together .
What does she say ?
You will know if you look at that flower .
My wife treasured that flower .
When I had decided to sell this house , that flower wilted and dried up .
But , just when I decided not to sell , it bloomed beautifully again , like that .
Your wife expressed her opinion through that flower ?
That 's what you are saying , right ?
That is correct .
If that 's the case , I guess I 'll have to negotiate with the flower .
Flower Wife , listen carefully and respond .
Your husband does not wish to sell this house , but I must buy this house .
Can you really never sell this house ?
If so , please nod your flower neck .
If not , I 'll cut your flower head .
What do you plan on doing ?
! Can 't you see I 'm negotiating ?
I will give you 3 seconds to decide .
1, 2, 3 .
Are you crazy ?
!
The crazy one is you .
Trying to overturn a deal closed between living people by dragging in a dead person , isn 't that crazy ?
Since I cut off your dead wife 's wishes for you , please follow the wishes of your living children .
Please ... sign .
You cruel bastard .
No matter what you say , my wife is here !
No , she isn 't .
Please come to your senses .
If you think lightly of a person 's heart and ignore it like this because you can 't see it , you 'll be struck by lightning !
I 'm going to continue to live smartly and well , ignoring the things I can 't see .
If what I say is wrong , I 'll readily take that lightning strike .
There is no lighting that struck me .
You just sold this house .
Congratulations .
If there are spirits , they 'll definitely come to take someone like you .
Are you really not scared of ghosts , Joo Goon ?
( goon = a title meaning " young sir " )
Why should I be afraid of a dead person ?
The living are scarier .
I 'll have to re-confirm the contract 's contents .
Please give me the recording .
Yes .
I read the entire document and saved it on file number 4 .
Kingdom Golf Course Purchase Contract
Seller :
Kim Wan Yoong , hereinafter First Party . Buyer :
Kingdom , hereinafter Second Party .
The purchase agreement between First and Second is agreed upon as follows :
What is that ?
Is it a person ?
Looks like they 're hailing a car .
Should I stop ?
Don 't pay any attention and go on .
What is it ?
No , it 's just that there was a bright light .
Did lightning strike ?
Scared me !
Thank you .
Aigoo .
I thought you were just going to pass by without seeing me , but you stopped .
What should I do ?
Just keep going .
Why are you outside in the rain at this time ?
Just now , some lady came and talked to me .
That lady really got it right , as if she were a ghost .
Right , she must be a ghost .
She said even if you avoided lightning , you wouldn 't be able to avoid me .
I guess she was right .
But ... is this car perhaps going to Seoul ?
Yes .
- No .
Let her off somewhere near here .
Yes , Boss .
Kingdom ?
Is this you , Mr. CEO ?
You felt that tingle , right ?
No .
Oh , there was a really strong tingle just now .
It was a strong tingle , wasn 't it ?
No !
My chance , is Kingdom that really big shopping mall ?
You see , I live nearby .
If you 're going there -
That intersection up there looks appropriate .
Please get out there .
Yes , I 'll do that .
Just keep going ! Please don 't stop !
Miss .
Miss , are you okay ?
Yes , thank you .
Just a moment .
In the midst of the confusion of that woman screaming , we happened to bring her all the way here .
Didn 't she scream on purpose because I told her to get off ?
That 's not what it seemed like .
What did she see that made her so scared ?
What ?
You said you got into that accident after drinking .
I really don 't understand how you can still long for alcohol after that .
No , it 's fine .
I can 't drink right now , I 'm sorry .
It 's fine , I haven 't gotten married either .
I 'm pretty ?
Really ?
Uh !
Pres ... !
Don 't follow me , go away .
I told you not to follow me .
He 's not following me .
He left .
Oh . There are two things that I dislike .
One is someone touching my money and the other is someone touching my body .
I cut the flower that touched my money , but what should I do with the hand that touched my body ?
Oh , I 'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable .
I did it because that man who was following me , scared me .
I don 't see anything .
He was here and he was following me . When I touched you like this , he disappeared .
But he 's still listening to us , my back is tingling so much .
That lady ghost ... is she friends with that man who followed you ?
Go have another drink with the lady and that man .
Right now there isn 't anyone .
I think it 's because of you .
Then again , I have a particular ability to get rid of annoyances that stick around .
Want to see ?
Let go ... and stay here .
Don 't get scared and watch closely .
Hey !
She 's following us .
She 's crazy .
Just keep going .
She said even if you avoided lightning , you wouldn 't be able to avoid me ... so that 's why I 'm here .
It 's not here ...
Why isn 't it here ?
Where is it ?
!
I wish the rain would stop and the sun would shine .
The marriage between soccer player Yoo Hae Sung and top star Tae Yi Ryeong has been the center of much attention .
We will follow closely for the location and details of this couple 's wedding .
Did you see this morning 's news ?
There was an entertainment news report saying that
Tae Yi and Yoo Hae Sung 's wedding will take place at Kingdom .
There were exactly 15 seconds on Kingdom .
That 's because it 's a report on Tae Yi Ryeong 's wedding , not an advertisement for our Kingdom .
If it 's a wedding I sponsor for an advertisement model for my company , it 's a company ad .
Glean as much publicity as we paid for .
We 'll get ten times as much .
Speaking of which , there 's been a problem .
An anonymous piece of mail was sent to the wedding hall .
This guy ... is Yoo Hae Seong .
That 's right .
However , these two people in the picture ... doesn 't it look like they are having a wedding ?
If this photo isn 't a fake , then Yoo Hae Seong has just found himself a past that will be quite expensive to deal with .
Send her an invitation .
You must absolutely not send one to her .
Tae Gong Sil ?
This girl ..
If it 's Tae Gong Sil , then the last name ... matches yours !
She 's pretty .
Were you close ?
We weren 't close .
Even still , invite her .
My goodness !
Just that ... if you just open the can , we can eat on our own .
No , since I 'm eating already , let 's just eat together .
What about your mom ?
She didn 't come home yesterday either ?
Mom came back but she 's busy so she went back !
But the lady in 202 said Noona was weird .
She said you 're a crazy hobo .
No .
It 's because after a big accident in the past , I became a little different from other people .
Even so , I even tried to live normally , going to work and everything .
I have prepared the coffee .
Hey !
What are you doing right now ?
! But so many scary people found me even at work , but even still , there were some guys who were after me .
Oh my !
But the scary apparitions kept getting in the way . But somehow I try to live and I try to work .
Welcome .
Where shall I take you ?
Because I don 't know when I will set my eyes on those scary people following me , I 'm always scared .
It 's difficult to keep going with my head held high .
I wish there were at least one place in this world where I could run away and hide .
Get a man .
My mom said that she 's seeing a man because she 's tired and lonely .
You should do that , too .
A man ?
Please don 't follow me !
Will that man see me ?
This woman ... was the girlfriend I was with before my fame and then she abandoned me .
To think she 'd send this even to the wedding hall ..
Please be careful that it doesn 't get leaked to the press .
This woman here is malicious .
If it 's malicious , you should cut it off .
Why do you live on with it ?
I 'm keeping this on out of spite .
The hate for the woman who abandoned me became fuel for me to keep going .
If you kept going for her to see , and if you 're marrying for her to see , then that woman will probably come to the wedding .
Please pay close attention to security .
The additional charge for paying extra attention will be added to your bill .
This marriage is a hot issue even abroad .
On the day of the wedding , reporters from many different countries will be present .
There will be worldwide publicity and Kingdom will become a milestone of Korean tourism .
Especially , if we can attract Chinese tourists by word of mouth from Chinese fans , Kingdom 's profits will skyrocket .
It 's an important soccer player .
Who are you ?
Why are you doing this to me ?
So I just have to tell that soccer player about that thing that 's buried under the tree ?
We might be able to talk if we ride the elevator .
Just a second !
Wait a minute !
What are you ?
Who are you ?
It 's me .
What 's going on ?
It 's a suspicious person .
Send her out .
Mr. CEO , it 's me !
Mr. CEO !
Ah , wait a minute !
We met on a rainy day !
That day you were upset because I touched you .
Don 't you remember ?
We even had that tingly moment in the car !
I even left my clothes that day .
You remember , don 't you ?
I came to meet you , but I happened upon a reason to see Yoo Hae Seong .
You have to meet the CEO and you have to meet the star .
You must be very busy .
I 'm not going to meet Yoo Hae Seong because I want to .
The one who 's special to me is you .
If you 're around me , I don 't have to meet that person .
Are you a vixen who latches on after one encounter ?
Or are you a crazy lady who 's supposed to stay at home , but escapes from time to time ?
If it 's the former , I 'll call a police car for you .
If it 's the latter , I 'll call an ambulance .
What kind of car do you want to go home in ?
Huh ?
I 've ridden in a police car , and an ambulance a few times , too . But I don 't want to ride in either of them again .
Then , go quietly .
If you keep sticking around , you 'll get to see a rougher method ( of getting around ) .
Sticking around troublesomely is really something to hate , isn 't it ?
You just make eye contact once , but they creepily follow you .
And they keep asking favors that have nothing to do with me .
I know since I didn 't like meeting those people , too .
I 'll leave .
Oppa says he 's in Spain .
Hyung-nim 's girl is even younger this time .
Oh , she 's pretty .
I guess CEO Jo doesn 't resemble hyung-nim very much seeing as he doesn 't have very many women around .
I wonder if he doesn 't have any because the ghost of that girl who died has latched onto him .
Do I need to do a ritual for him ?
I need to take a bigger part and find him a partner .
It 'll be difficult .
Haven 't you heard that Kingdom 's master is caught in the curse of his first love ?
Everytime CEO Jo 's marriage is discussed , the woman 's family falls into ruin , gets injured , or arrested .
Word 's out that all of that 's because of the curse , so it 'll be difficult to have a regular marriage .
What do you mean curse ?
A curse on your nephew ?
I know , right ?
Curse ?
No , it 's because of his personality he has no girlfriend .
He 's never called me Uncle .
That 's ... because you 're so young , Dear .
The stars ... spill out ...
The sun is ... shi - ni - ng .
Tom -
Tomorrow ... will - become colder - probab - ly .
Resume Kang Woo .
This is the best room we have .
But , are you really staying for a month ?
Yes .
If you go to the roof top , you can do your laundry and exercise .
The view 's great too !
Go away .
Go away .
Are you a person ?
Yes .
You 're a person .
Oh , you 're staying in room 404 .
Since the grandmother left , you 'll be able to sleep well .
There was a grandmother living in that room ?
She wasn 't living there , she was just there .
I have lived here for a long time so if you have a problem , let me know .
Also , I 'm sorry if I scared you earlier , I thought you weren 't a person .
I didn 't think you were a person either .
I thought you were a cat .
Happy and sleeping peacefully like a cat .
So it was like that .
Why did you have to bother a sleeping cat ?
Meow !
He is good looking .
That person ... meet him for me .
Let 's see an intimate pose .
Yes , good .
Bride , lean on the groom 's shoulder .
After this marriage , will you forego your re-entry to the European league completely ?
No , I will be making contact with a new agency .
You said you weren 't going to Europe .
You have your injury and your age to worry about .
If you go again , you 'll just detract from your stardom .
You 'll get flamed and downgraded .
Before I 'm a star , I 'm a soccer athlete .
And it 's given that I want to run on a bigger stage .
Hae Seong ...
People ... say we are the Korean Victoria and Beckham .
Victoria doesn 't want to encourage Beckham to self-destruct .
You don 't have the confidence either .
Let 's talk later .
I heard there 's no one seeking you out anymore .
Didn 't your manager tell you ?
Hyung .
Weren 't we going to continue to search ?
Give up .
Rather than imprudently heading for Europe , it 's much safer to live here with Tae Yi Ryeong as a star couple .
Forget it .
If you 're not going to look , I 'll look myself .
You can 't be worrying about such things right now .
This came again .
Why are we doing this ?
Later , if you ever you get rid of me ... it 's something to blackmail you with .
What are you talking about ?
Why would I abandon you ?
You keep the key .
When I was with Mi Kyeong , it was during my hardest time .
I 'd done a lot of things that , if they found out , people would point fingers at me for .
All my ugly past is probably in there .
Ah , did you look for it ?
Where is that thing ?
It 's not there .
She must have taken it out .
Do you think she 's ... blackmailing me with that ?
Don 't worry .
Just trust me .
As long as you 're with me , I 'll take care of everything .
You scared me , Miss .
I have a favor to ask .
By any chance , will the President be meeting Yoo Hae Seong ?
As far as I know , they are scheduled to meet today .
But I can 't take you .
I guess you can 't , huh ?
Then ... perhaps can you give this to Yoo Hae Seong ?
When Yoo Hae Seong sees this , he 'll come to meet me .
Please deliver it to him .
I wish this would end quickly , so I could sleep .
This must be where she kept looking out for that person .
Look at what ?
I thought he was a nice guy .
What is this ?
I 'll wait beneath the tree at Sky Park 's central plaza .
Who is this face ?
Is this girl , perhaps , Kim Mi Kyeong ?
How do you know Kim Mi Kyeong ?
She 's the woman that has been threatening Yoo Hae Seong .
What do you mean threatening ?
That 's not it .
Where is this girl ?
She isn 't here right now .
Where did she go ?
She ... died .
She died ?
Then are you the one threatening us ?
No .
I just wanted to relay her feelings .
The whole time , she has been wanting to protect and encourage him , is what she said .
So he knows how she really feels . Please give this to Yoo Hae Seong .
You can 't .
If she 's dead , that 's the end .
Don 't bother a living person .
Mother !
Ahjussi .
You 're that lady from last time .
Thanks about that .
Isn 't this a gambling place ?
Grandmother said not to gamble her money .
Mind your own business .
Ahjussi !
How can you do this ?
Grandmother asked you so many times not to gamble that money .
I even got you that .
Why do you care so much about my late mother ?
Let go !
Yeah .
I 'm going around doing useless things .
What 's so important about what the dead have to say ?
No one ever even listens .
Oh my !
Get lost !
Don 't follow me !
Stop bothering me !
People treat me like a crazy person because of people like you !
Just leave me alone so I can live !
Are you sure you were being blackmailed by Kim Mi Kyeong ?
I think you 're mistaken .
No , it is that woman .
He saw her standing outside near the office .
You saw it personally ?
That person ... is dead .
I 'll stop her so don 't get so worked up .
I 'll stick with you and everything will be solved .
I loved her , so I don 't know why she 's doing this to me .
Probably for money .
Is there anything a living person wants aside from money ?
Aren 't you doing this because you 're afraid of losing what you have now ?
I 'm ... afraid of how she feels .
Why fear the feelings you can 't see ?
You should be scared of the people you can .
Anyway , I think you are going to do well .
I just applied for Kingdom and got in .
Yes , I will keep watch .
Wow .
I got the occasion to meet Yoo Hae Seong thanks to Yi Ryeong .
Today is not Tae Yi Ryeong 's wedding day , but the day we make Kingdom 's advertisement .
We 've positioned the Kingdom logo so when photographing the bride and groom , there 's no avoiding it .
Even if they can see just one , hang a large one so everyone can see clearly .
Make it as BIG as the money we put in .
Big !
Yes , big !
Kim Mi Kyeong
You should come too .
I don 't know if this is going to work or not , but you 'll be too pitiful if we let him keep misunderstanding .
That woman even came here .
Why is she so keen on meeting Yoo Hae Seong ?
Something about relaying a dead person 's feelings .
Get security to take care of her so she doesn 't get in the way .
Yes .
Team Leader , the guest in the fourth camera from A-Block , we have orders to follow that guest .
Lee Yeon Joo , watch out for the female guest passing there .
Meow
The cat ?
You can take pictures .
And it 's ok if you share with others that we 're colleagues .
Thank you .
You look pretty .
Tae Gong Sil is not here yet ?
Gong Sil ?
' Big sun ' ?
She 's coming ?
Tae Gong Sil was the ' big sun ' , and you were ' little sun ' . That 's right .
That 's right .
I wonder how she is now .
I heard she turned really strange .
Why ?
Tae Gong Sil did ?
I am friends with the bride .
You 're on the list .
Come in .
Confirm her .
Yes .
That woman is a guest attending Yi Ryeong 's wedding .
She is ?
Is she on the guest list ?
Did you check ?
Yes .
She went to the same high school as Tae Yi Ryeong .
They call her Tae Gong Sil .
Tae Gong Sil ?
So did you let her in ?
Excuse me .
Who are you ?
This ..
Why do you have this ?
The person threatening me was you ?
What about Mi Kyeong ?
Where is Mi Kyeong ?
Mi Kyeong must have come with you .
Where is she ?
So you blackmail me with this and what , do you want money ?
Fine .
I 'll give you that money .
Where is Mi Kyeong ?
Where is she ? !
Mi Kyeong ... passed away .
What ?
She was already sick when you left her .
She hurt very much until she passed .
You were so frighteningly mistaken . So I came to tell you Mi Kyeong 's true feelings .
Why isn 't Hae Seong coming ?
What about Hae Seong ?
Yi Ryeong , Yoo Hae Seong has disappeared .
What ?
They said he went outside for a while .
Did the groom possibly run away ?
Ah !
That blackmailer must have shown up .
There 's no way she could show up .
She definitely died ...
Ah ... that 's not what I meant .
I knew you have been blackmailing her .
If you were going to do that , you should have done a better job .
Seems like you are the one that is blackmailing him !
But ...
What are you looking at ?
Tae Gong Sil ...
I must have relayed your feelings wrong .
You held onto your memories here , all alone .
I wonder how you must have felt .
Hae Seong .
I miss you .
I miss you so much .
Let 's stop here .
Going further is a little ...
Mi Kyeong ...
What are you talking about ?
I can 't pick up after you anymore .
Go on by yourself .
Mi Kyeong .
Mi Kyeong !
Mi Kyeong wanted to show you how she felt .
Just ... Go .
My life is over anyway .
It 's not over .
You have to continue soccer , okay ?
I know you like soccer .
Is that a good thing ?
Those cleats were the first things she 'd ever given to you ...
Mi Kyeong .
I miss you .
... and leaving you was the last thing she could have done for you .
Oppa !
Hae Seong !
I 've been waiting without ruining everything .
So talk to me .
I ... I know it 's too much , but I want to keep playing soccer .
The woman inside my heart keeps encouraging me to .
I will compensate for the damages .
Because of the blackmail scandal , my manager agreed to take responsibility without complaint .
As the dead lingers around , the living person suffers in the end .
Though your event may have been ruined , my wedding was saved .
This ... was my real wedding .
At your age , and with your injury , it won 't be easy to return to playing in the big leagues .
You will come to repeatedly regret this moment .
That could happen .
That is what will happen .
The romance that the dead brought may have given you courage , but it doesn 't give you skill .
I 'm going to enjoy watching you fail in every match .
Watching soccer 's about to become much more enjoyable .
Are you cursing me ?
Yes .
So take that grudge against me and try to live well , so I can see - just like you did last time .
You can go .
Tae Gong Sil asked me to tell you something .
Please , no one come to me today .
I 'm so tired to death !
I wish I could run away somewhere and sleep peacefully .
Don 't come .
Go away .
What did you say Tae Gong Sil said ?
That the dead have no power , but their feelings remain .
There 's someone like that for you , too .
Joo Goon , do you also have someone in your heart , that is dead and you cannot forget ?
Hee Joo !
Cha Hee Joo !
Hee Joo !
Tae Gong Sil
Tae Gong Sil
What are you saying is next to me ?
What do you see beside me ?
I 'm so sleepy !
Tell me .
What is it that 's beside me ?
I want to sleep next to you .
Episode 2 .
Who are you ?
- I really just want to sleep .
- Wake up and open your eyes !
- Please just sleep with me .
- What ?
Are you asking me to sleep with you ?
With ... the way you look right now ... you 're standing there asking me to sleep with you ?
Let 's sleep .
I can sleep with you .
I can 't sleep with you .
Stop dreaming .
You . Just because you keep touching me , and asking me to sleep with you ... you think ... that I 'll fall for you ?
When did you last wash your hair ?
If you 're going to try to seduce someone , try washing your hair first !
It 's not like you 're even going to sleep with me .
Why did you come here ?
I heard ... that you were going around talking about me ?
What is it that you heard about me ?
Or do you really ... know something about her ?
Did you ... and Hee Joo know each other ?
That woman 's name was Hee Joo ?
What is this ?
How do you know Hee Joo ?
I saw her .
That woman ... I saw her .
What ?
Are you still not fully awake ?
- That woman ... - She 's dead , right ?
That 's right .
Hee Joo died a long time ago .
So when and how are you saying that you saw her ?
I saw ... that woman standing next to you recently .
I ... see dead people .
The master 's woman is a ghost .
It 's a pretty famous story at Kingdom Enterprises .
Our President Joo is still living with the memories of his dead first love in his heart . That 's why he 's still not even married .
Whenever he even thinks about getting married the dead woman 's ghost appears , and breaks up the relationship , right ?
A dead woman ? Are you talking about the female student that died in the car accident that was related to President Joo a long time ago ?
That 's right !
That was a pretty well-known accident .
I remember it being all over the news when I was younger .
The rich boy and his girlfriend both were kidnapped together .
It was the ' Ten billion won kidnapping ' case .
They lost the ransom money , but never caught the culprits , right ?
Ten billion back then would be about ... equivalent to 100 billion won now ?
- 100 billion won ?
- Billions !
I 'm sure the guys who took that money ... are living very well somewhere .
But ...
Do all the employees call President Joo , ' The Master ' ? Joo Joong Won is the king of Kingdom Enterprises .
That 's why he 's called ' The Master ' .
He also known as ' The Tyrant ' .
The master is living well while acting like a tyrant . So , it 's understandable that the unfortunate girl who was kidnapped along with him would become a restless ghost from the injustice of her death .
Master ...
Find me my justice .
The rumor has it that she crys like that while roaming around Kingdom Enterprise .
And because of that , I can 't even sleep at night .
- Let 's toast to that . Cheers !
There was an incident where I almost died , but I somehow came back to life .
Ever since then ... I see dead people .
So , you 're telling me that you saw Hee Joo who died 15 years ago ... the day before yesterday ?
That day ... when you got mad at me and left ... that 's when I saw her .
If she 's dead , then it 's all over .
Stop pestering someone who 's still alive .
Even though it was just for a moment ... I still saw her .
You 're telling me that you see ghosts ?
Are there any ghosts here with us right now ?
How many of them are there ?
See that chair over there ?
Do you see how it 's rocking back and forth even though the wind isn 't even blowing ?
So what ?
There 's one right there .
You 're telling me ... that there 's one on that chair over there ?
Sometimes they come looking for me ... or they find me on the streets .
I try my best to ignore them ... but they keep ... following me around .
Sometimes ... they want to talk to me .
And sometimes ... they ask me for my help .
They always cling onto me so that I can 't even sleep .
I 'm so afraid of them and can 't stand having them around . But I can 't help myself from seeing and hearing them .
But when I hold onto you like this , I don 't see nor hear them anymore .
I 've never met someone like you .
That 's why you 're so special to me .
I wonder ... what you mean to me ?
I have a feeling ... that I 'll be able to sleep well , and live a normal life if I stay with you .
I want to remain by your side .
You want to be with me that badly ?
Why don 't you just tell me that you own this building ? Then , I 'll look you over since this building is expensive here .
I really am so miserable .
You may not know what it 's like since you can 't hear them or see them but I 'm so terrified .
I 'm not scared of something that I can 't see nor hear .
You 're scared of this chair because it keeps on rocking ?
What do you think ? Does this scare you even more now ?
You . If you ever try to make another pass at me , then I 'll really destroy you .
No matter what kind of scary things that you may do to me I don 't think it could be any scarier than what I 'm looking at right now .
I 'm just going to run away and stay right next to you .
So , it 's not because I have an immense amount of money or because I 'm unbelievably good looking . You want to be with me because you 're afraid of ghosts ?
That 's a very refreshing approach .
It 's more like a desperate approach .
It 's too lonely and sad for me to continue to live on like this .
Look here , Ms. Tae Gong Shil .
Even when that infamous girl Candy makes a pass on a rich man no matter how lonely or sad she is ... she always ties her back hair neatly before she comes onto the man .
Wash that smelly head of yours , and wake up to your senses .
You see me as a penniless girl who 's trying to seduce a rich man , don 't you ?
I 'm still going to do it .
Can 't I just be your Candy ?
Just because you try ... do you think that you can seduce me ?
Fine , why don 't you try your best to lure me with your ghost friends ? You perverted Candy girl with your dirty hair .
It 's Ms. Tae .
Tae Gong Shil .
My name is Ms. Tae . ( Ms. Tae translated as ' The Sun ' . )
Ms. Tae ?
If you 're the sun ... then I never want to see the morning again .
The sun is going to rise , and I 'm going to come to stay by your side .
I 'll make sure to wash my hair the next time I see you !
Mr. Joo . ( Mr. Joo translated as ' The Master ' . ) Did you get to see Ms. Tae ?
I meant , did you see Ms. Tae Gong Shil ?
I never should 've came here .
Let 's go .
What was he doing here ?
He probably thinks that I 'm crazy .
But I really can see them .
Hee Joo ?
I really did see her , too .
There .
There 's one right there .
If such things as ghosts really does exist ... I wish I could conjure her up just once .
Cha Hee Joo .
Spirit , spirit ...
Come to us .
Spirit , spirit ...
Come to us .
Spirit , spirit ...
Come to us .
Spirit , spirit ...
Come to us .
What are they doing ?
They 're calling Eun Seol 's dead spirit .
Spirit , spirit ...
Are you here ?
She 's here .
Are you ...
Lee Eun Seol ?
It says it 's Eun Seol .
They 're just joking around . Don 't pay them any attention .
Why did you die ?
Is the person responsible for your death ... in this room right now ?
Tell us .
Is she ... here ?
We asked if the person responsible for your death is in this room right now .
What are you girls doing ?
Get back in your seats .
Do you think that Eun Seol was really here ?
Don 't respond to a prank like that .
Let 's just study .
[ Lee Eun Seol ]
- It 's Eun Seol . - What ?
Was this picture taken in front of our Kingdom Enterprise 's fountain ?
Yes .
This picture is all over the internet right now .
Are you sure this isn 't some kind of a mistake ?
You know how sometimes there 's a glare in the picture if the camera isn 't focused ?
But look at how all the other girls in the picture came out clearly .
And don 't you think that the position that the girl is standing is strange ?
Look closely .
It means that she was standing right here when this picture was taken .
Yes , I see .
I doubt that she went into the water to get in the picture .
Then ... does it mean that it really is a ghost ?
If this picture is real ... then it means that she 's a poltergeist .
What do you mean , a picture of a poltergeist ?
- How does that even make any sense ?
- I tested it myself . Unless she really is a ghost ... it would 've been impossible for her to have been in that picture .
I 'm sure that it was fabricated .
Our company image is already in trouble after Tae Yi Ryung 's wedding got called off . And now we 've got this garbage to deal with , too ?
Vice President . Is this how you manage things around here ?
I did make a request for the picture to be deleted off the website .
No matter , this incident has put Kingdom Enterprise at the top of the search site .
Kingdom 's poltergeist , and Kingdom 's ghost .
All the employees are talking about how exciting it is to have a ghost on our premise .
You find this funny ?
You find this situation ... to be exciting ?
Well ... the ghost is pretty scary . But it 's kind of fascinating , too .
This is no time to be fascinated with ghosts right now .
A giant mall that 's going to stand in the path of Kingdom 's success is going up floor by floor each day .
They 're going to be opening in two months .
A giant that 's even scarier than a ghost is rising up in front of our very own eyes .
There 's only two months left ?
They sure built it fast .
You need to get your head on straight if you don 't want to be out of a job in two months . Tell the employees not to be lured by the ghost story . Tell them to lure in the customers .
Make them open up their wallets and spend their money . Their money !
I know a guy who works at a TV station .
Should I submit this to him ?
I heard they give out prizes if the story gets picked up .
Sir . This picture is mine . She 's my ghost .
Mine .
You are being so absurd .
Okay , fine .
[ Seeking part time employees . ]
- Hi . - Oh my goodness !
Gong Shil !
What are you doing out in the middle of the day instead of sleeping ?
- Did you come here to see me ?
I ... I just got a job at Kingdom Enterprises .
What ?
Gong Shil . It hasn 't been that long since I became a manager here . If you get hauled off by the police or taken away in an ambulance
I won 't be able to work here . Gong Ri , that may not happen here .
Because I 've got something special here .
Why ? You don 't see those things when you 're here ?
I have a place that I could run off to so that I don 't see those things .
But why are you drinking two cups of coffee ?
It 's because you 're too sleepy staying awake during the day , isn 't it ? No , it 's not .
Some kid ... keeps following me around telling me that he wants some coffee . I ordered one for him , too .
Gong Ri , I 'm going to get going .
Hey !
Hey , Gong Shil !
This ... is the picture that we took on the day that Eun Seol died , isn 't it ?
Yeah .
But ... why is dead Eun Seol in this picture ?
Do you think that the dead Eun Seol ... sent this to us ?
To show us that she hates us ?
I 'm sure that someone 's just playing a prank .
Some kids are saying that Eun Seol died because of us .
It was a car accident .
It wasn 't because of us .
The truth is ... I think it is our fault that she 's dead .
If we hadn 't done what we did to her that day ... she probably wouldn 't have died .
I think that Eun Seol is still with us ... because she hates us .
Who is this supposed ghost in the picture ?
Rumor has it that it 's the girl who died awhile back because of President Joo .
That 's just absurd !
- Who 's going around saying things like that ?
I 'm saying that 's what the employees are saying to themselves .
Everyone knows about that incident because it was so well-known . They always said that President Joo has that girl 's spirit attached to him .
That girl died a very long time ago .
Is that image of the ghost ... really the same girl ?
I do remember her having long hair .
And I think she was around the same age as these girls when she died .
But I can 't remember what her face looked like .
It 's understandable that your memories would falter at your age .
I heard this is where the ghost was seen .
- A ghost ?
- Yeah .
Let 's try taking a picture .
Okay , let 's see .
Is that poltergeist picture still causing a lot of talk ?
Even though the Vice President and his team are trying to take care of it but stories like this isn 't going to be easy to quiet down .
And on top of everything else , there 's an absurd rumor going around , too .
What is the additional absurd rumor that 's now going around ?
The thing is ...
- What the heck ?
I 'm soaking wet ! - Are you okay ?
Come on and get back up here .
I shouldn 't have got on this ghost fountain .
Sorry .
Ghost fountain .
Do they even know how expensive this fountain is ?
There are four goddesses pillars in that fountain .
So , you 're telling me that those goddesses are being pushed out by a single ghost ?
A scary ghost is more shocking than beautiful goddesses .
Beauty helps people feel relaxed , but fear keeps them nervous .
They have the ability to keep them drawn in so that they can 't help but stare and wonder .
I 'm sure that 's why people are lured in by such stories .
How truly shocking and frightening .
What do you think you 're doing ?
What are you doing here ?
I 'm cleaning .
I just got hired here .
I 'm sure that there are plenty of other places that needs cleaning . So why of all places , are you here cleaning ?
Because ... you 're here .
You really are pulling out all the moves .
When a woman is trying to seduce a rich man she always starts by getting a job where she can be seen by him .
Use the job as an excuse to lock gazes , and share their meals together at times .
Is that what you were thinking ?
I know that you don 't believe me ... but you know that 's not what I 'm expecting from you .
Ah ... you said it 's because of the ghosts , didn 't you ?
Ghosts .
I heard that there 's ghost here .
Did you come here to see your friend ?
You say there 's a ghost here ?
No , there isn 't .
There isn 't ?
No , there isn 't .
If there was a ghost ... I 'm sure that I would 've grabbed onto you .
There really isn 't one ?
Are you sure ?
That 's what I thought .
This fountain is way too expensive for a ghost to be hanging around in .
Yes , I 'm positive that there aren 't any ghosts .
That 's a relief .
President Joo ... so you believe me now ?
Right ? You believe me now , don 't you ?
Believe what ? It 's a given that there aren 't any ghosts .
It 's not because I believe you , but it 's because there are no such things as ghosts .
And , you ... I don 't want you cleaning here .
Why not ?
It 's also a given for me to kick you out of here .
Get lost , Ms. Tae .
President Joo .
President Joo .
We 've got a problem .
I don 't know how the TV station got ahold of it ... but that poltergeist picture is being broadcasted on their news today .
Why would a picture that some kids fabricated be broadcasted on the news ?
The rumors just kept on spreading until the story blew up .
I think the incident from your past got mixed into the rumor that 's floating around .
There 's a picture that 's been floating around all over the internet lately .
An image of a young girl 's face can be seen behind these brightly smiling girls .
A picture which catches the image of a ghost like you see in this picture is what we call a poltergeist picture .
In that case ... who is the girl in this picture ?
While investigating the mystery within this picture ... we were able to unearth a terrifying link between the location where ... this picture was taken , and a tragic incident from the past .
Do you remember the ' Ten Billion Won Kidnapping ' case that shook the nation in its wake 15 years ago ?
Mr. Joo was kidnapped along with his girlfriend . While the police were staking out the culprits who were making their ransom demands his girlfriend who was kidnapped along with him lost her life in this extremely tragic case .
The kidnapped young Mr. Joo ... is the current CEO of the shopping mall that this poltergeist picture was taken from .
There is a very peculiar rumor floating around the mall .
The ghost of President Joo 's ex-girlfriend haunting this mall is a rumor that all of us employees have already known about .
I don 't know if it 's because of that , but security at night can get pretty eerie and to be honest , all the female employees that we have at the mall ...
The ghost of the dead Ms. Cha who 's rumored to haunt the grounds of this mall .
That 's not the same girl that I saw .
One of our writers went to visit the detective who was in charge of that accident .
The statute of limitation for that case is expiring soon .
Since we closed the case without having caught the perpetrators ... I 'm sure that the dead victim has more than enough reason for her to feel angry .
Who could the girl in this picture be ?
Could it be the ghost of the late Ms. Cha ?
Or ... could it be just a prank that someone is trying to pull ?
But one thing is certain , the place where this picture was taken ... roams a spirit of a young girl who died too young before her time .
Excuse me .
It 's not her .
The girl in the picture isn 't Cha Hee Joo , who lingers by your side .
There seems to be some sort of a mistake , don 't you think ?
Shut up and get out of my way .
You saw that on TV , right ?
They said that this is just a ghost that 's always been around Kingdom Enterprises .
But you know that 's Eun Seol .
We ... all know that .
Should we ... go there ?
What were you thinking giving that interview and getting involved in such absurdity ?
The statute of limitation for that case is going to expire soon . I was hoping that the interview would bring some new piece of information on the case .
Did you think that shocking people with that ghost story ... was going to scare the perpetrators into turning themselves in or something ?
If the perpetrators saw that , I 'm sure they would 've felt some sense of guilt .
In some ways , Cha Hee Joo died because of you .
Don 't you feel the least bit sorry to her ?
You seem to be living a very nice life as the President of Kingdom Enterprises .
Of all people , shouldn 't you be the one that never forgets her ?
You seem to hate me because I ended up living a normal and nice of a life .
Forget the past . The living must go on living .
All I 've done is not forget those words that you told me 15 years ago and I 'm living the way that you told me to live .
Did I say that ?
Anyways ... I 'm never going to give up on this case .
In that case , my money that you lost ... make sure you get that back for me as well .
Is it that you 're truly okay with all this ?
You experienced a post traumatic disorder after that incident , didn 't you ?
Can you read about it now ?
I 'm ... all better now .
So , you 're not really well , and living the good life , are you ?
I wonder who this is ?
Didn 't you say that she 's a ghost ?
I wonder if she really is the spirit of some dead girl ?
Didn 't you say that you see those people ?
Can 't you just search for her ?
That 's true .
If I can find her , then I could help her .
And maybe if I help her , she may be able to stay with them , right ?
Is your mom ... not coming home again tonight ?
No , I guess she 's too busy earning money .
Okay , then eat as much as you want , and sleep in my bed when you get sleepy .
Even if she seems weird , we have to act like we believe her .
That way she will continue to feed us .
Here , eat .
I saw a few while I was cleaning .
Excuse me , can you show me your face ?
I 'm sorry , but I don 't think you 're the one .
By any chance ... have you seen this girl ?
Um ... Can you please just take a closer look ?
It 's the girl who was hanging out around the fountain over there .
They never listen when I tell them to go away .
So , why would they answer me when I 'm asking them something ?
I 'm so sleepy .
Are you human ?
What are you doing sitting there like a thieving cat ?
Ah , it 's Room 404 .
Ah , I forgot you told me that you work here .
When I saw you from the security room ... I noticed that you kept wandering around .
I 'm one of the cleaners here .
I started working here a few days ago .
But the cleaning team ... are already all gone for the day .
I lost something while I was cleaning . So , I was just walking around to see if I could find it .
I 'm just going to go look around some more .
I 'll come with you .
No , it 's okay .
But , it 's too scary for you to go around in the dark by yourself .
There 's that rumor about the ghost roaming around here , too .
I 'll walk around with you .
Let 's go since there aren 't any people around .
What if Eun Seol shows up ?
Then , let 's ask her .
Let 's ask her why she 's tormenting us .
So , what is it that you 're looking for ?
It 's not something that you can see .
My vision is very good .
You still won 't be able to see it no matter how good your sight is .
It 's not ' You ' .
My name is Kang Woo .
Kang Woo .
And my name is Tae Gong Shil .
You can hold onto me if you 're scared .
Thank you .
Eun Seol . We came to see you .
We have something to tell you .
Are you ... here ?
Over there . - They 're people .
- Yes , you 're right .
They look like young female students .
What are those four girls doing over there ?
There are only three .
Hey , girls !
What are you doing down there ?
Girls !
Is it you ?
Things would get a lot more complicated if we are caught .
We never should 've come here .
It 's you three , isn 't it ?
This place hasn 't changed a bit and looks exactly the same as it did 15 years ago .
The reason why you came all the way down here ... is it because you 're bothered by the fact that the statute of limitation is almost expired ?
Did you really not see any of their faces ... when you were held captive 15 years ago ?
No , I didn 't see them .
I guess if you had seen their faces ... I 'm sure you would 've ended up just like Miss Cha .
That 's true .
It 's because she knew who the perpetrators were ... that she died .
Is it true that Kingdom is cursed ?
No , that 's just absurd .
I heard that the reason why my wedding was broken off ... is because Kingdom is cursed .
No , it wasn 't a curse . It was a change in his heart .
Yoo Hye Sung . I 'm going to put a curse on him .
But ... the girl who brought the stuff from Hye Sung 's ex-girlfriend to shake him up like that ... do you still not know who that was ?
My husband said he saw her .
Once he finds out who it was ... I 'll make sure to reprimand her for you .
Tell me who it is first .
Because I 'll take care of her myself .
To see the sun first thing in the morning when I wake up is offensive enough but now as soon as I come to work ... I have to see your face ?
I told you to quit working here , didn 't I ?
I figured it out .
Figured what out ?
The ghost in that picture . I found out who that girl is .
Who is she ?
But ... if I tell you who it is ... will you allow me to continue to work here ?
But if you 're wrong ... you 're going to end up cleaning up the floors in a lockup .
That seat over there is that girl 's desk .
Her name was Lee Eun Seol , and she was a student here who died a month ago .
And those three girls over there ... they were Lee Eun Seol 's friends .
They came to the fountain late last night .
Then ... I bet those girls are responsible for it .
Is this really you three ?
Eun Seol was your friend . Why did you play a prank like this ?
We didn 't do it .
It was just a picture that we took of ourselves ... and Eun Seol 's image got captured in it , too .
And it was dead Eun Seol who sent this picture to us .
She 's just trying to torment us .
Stop with this absurd ghost story . Just tell the truth of what you three have done .
You are tormenting her dead soul just like you did when she was still alive .
That 's why you pulled this prank , isn 't it ?
We never tormented her !
Eun Seol was the one who always ruined everything and made things difficult for us .
- Hey !
- Hey !
You should 've been more careful !
What are we going to do now ? Our grades were going to be based on that !
What are you going to do about it now ?
I 'm so sorry , you guys . I feel so awful !
She was always so ignorant and clumsy . And she was always a nuisance whenever she was around us .
Hey , guys ! I 'll buy the drinks .
Hey , Lee Eun Seol .
You 're only buying for drinks again ?
I 'm sorry , but I 'm a little short on my allowance lately .
Here . Apple , orange , and lemon .
Each of your favorites .
This looks so good !
She always mooched off of us , and she 'd only pay for the drinks ... we still didn 't say anything to her .
Lee Eun Seol ... was nothing but a nuisance .
So , you killed Lee Eun Seol because she was a nuisance and fabricated this story about her becoming a ghost ?
She didn 't die because of us .
That day ... when our midterm grades were ruined because of what Lee Eun Seol did ... we were all so annoyed with her .
That 's why we all decided to just hang out by ourselves without her . But she was too dense to realize that , and followed us there .
We just want to hang out by ourselves today .
What ? I said , we just want to hang out by ourselves .
You should just get going now if you 're done with us here .
Ah , that 's right , I forgot . I have something else that I needed to do .
I have some things to do , so I need to get going .
Have fun .
Ga Young , don 't you think that was a little too rude ?
She 's so dense that being straight with her is the only way she 'll understand .
Can you take a picture of us ?
One , two , three .
This is the picture that the three of us took .
But Eun Seol sent us this other picture .
That 's the day ... Eun Seol got into the car accident on her way back home .
That must be why Eun Seol ... cursed us and sent us that picture .
I 'm not going to go easy on you just because you shed a few tears .
If the picture was sent to you by her cellphone ... then I 'm sure it was sent by the person who has her cellphone .
Since it was Eun Seol 's cellphone ... I 'm sure it was Eun Seol who sent it .
It wasn 't Eun Seol .
It wasn 't Eun Seol who cursed you out of her hatred for you .
You have Eun Seol 's cellphone , don 't you ?
Excuse me ?
I know that you found Eun Seol 's cellphone when she lost it that day .
I know that you still have it . So , hand it over .
It was you ?
You 're the one who pulled this prank ?
How could you do this ?
Do you know how shocked and scared we were ?
I did it to shock and scare you guys .
Because you guys were so hateful .
Who do you think you are ?
On ... the day that Eun Seol died ... I saw the three of you with Eun Seol .
Orange , apple , and lemon .
Okay .
Lee Eun Seol !
It came out so pretty .
You know how dense Lee Eun Seol is .
What if she comes back with drinks in hand ? No kidding .
I wouldn 't put it past her . I don 't think I 'd be strong enough to tell her to go away .
Let 's make this picture our new profile picture . Let 's call ourselves the ' Three Musketeers' and put it up as our profile picture .
So , that she can 't try to butt in .
Okay .
Let 's go .
That 's how ... Lee Eun Seol died .
How is that our fault ?
That was just a car accident ! She used up all the money she had for her bus fare to buy those drinks for you guys . She died on her way walking back home .
And watching the way the three of you acted after she died ... you guys were just so hateful .
Lee Joo Yeon . You placed first in class again , didn 't you ?
Kim Ga Young , you got yourself a new boyfriend .
And Ha Hyo Jin ... I heard that you 're taking special treatments to help you grow taller , isn 't that right ?
I did it to make you guys suffer . You guys seemed so unaffected .
Ever since Eun Seol 's ghost appeared , you haven 't been able to study ... you haven 't been able to date ... and you seem to actually have been shrinking .
You 're feeling guilty because you know you did something wrong !
What do you think you girls are doing ?
This isn 't what Eun Seol wanted .
Keep your mouth shut .
The living are just trying to survive .
It 's not something the dead should get involved in .
Did you check it out ?
I saw that it 's not my fault .
A very strong proof of it .
Excuse me .
Forget it . All that matters is that I found out whatever it is that I need to know .
I 'm not curious to know how you found out about it .
I know because I can see .
Eun Seol is so sad .
I think I need to let her friends know that .
Do you think ... that what we did was that bad ?
Enough to be cursed for it ?
She said that Eun Seol died because of us .
Because she hated us .
What do we do now ?
It 's not like we can even apologize ... to someone who 's already dead .
[ I really am with you guys right now . ]
[ I 'll listen if there 's anything that you guys want to tell me . ]
It 's Eun Seol . I thought that lady took Eun Seol 's phone earlier .
Then ... this is ...
It 's Eun Seol .
Let 's just think that it 's Eun Seol .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm so sorry .
I 'm sorry , too .
I used to think that you were annoying .
I treated you so badly .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm so sorry .
I wish that you could ... just smile at us and tell us that it 's okay like you used to .
Apple . Orange . And lemon .
Apple .
Orange .
Lemon .
My friends .
It 's okay .
Eun Seol .
I 'm sorry , Eun Seol . I 'm sorry .
What do you think Ms. Tae is looking at right now ?
She 's just ... staring off into space .
Is that how it looks to you ?
For some reason ... I can 't help but look at Ms. Tae as she stares at something that we can 't see .
Let 's go . Wait .
- What about Ms. Tae ?
- I 'm sure she 'll just go away .
Are you going to keep the promise you made her about not kicking her out ?
So ... can I continue to clean here ?
Yes .
I 'm too busy of a man to care about the management of the cleaning crew . That 's what he told me .
Then would it be okay for me to go thank him myself ?
Make sure that nothing unsavory happens on the fourth floor where my office is . That 's what he also told me .
He doesn 't want you to come up there .
Why do you look so disappointed ?
He 's going to have to come down here anyways .
Yes , you 're right .
Um ... what 's going to happen to those girls ?
Are they going to be punished ... for fabricating that picture ?
He decided to just let it go .
I thought that he was really angry with that whole ghost story .
He 's actually very happy at the moment because of that whole ghost story .
A rumor has spread that the fountain is haunted by a ghost who grants people their wish , and people are just flocking over to it .
Take a look . Look at how much coin has piled up in the past few days .
Maybe I 'll throw one in there myself .
Hey , kiddo .
Do you want to make a wish , too ? What 's your wish ?
I want a new toy and a new pair of running shoes .
Really ?
I 'll give you this coin ... so go stand in front of your mom and shout out your wish in a loud clear voice .
Your wish will come true if you go up to the kids mall up there on the second floor .
- Go on .
- Mom , I have a wish I want to make .
Most people 's wishes are just a form of one 's desires .
As long as it results in a rise in my profit , I don 't care if it 's a goddess or a ghost . Advertise it . Let people know their wishes will be granted .
I 'm just going to bury the fabricated photo incident .
Why ?
Because of that ruse , the story about your past came back to light .
The bigger deal I make of it , the bigger this story is going to get . But if I just quietly bury the story , then it 's just going to go away .
Can you put it away ?
Are you still not letting anyone into your life because you still think that you 're responsible for her death ?
Do you still feel that guilty about it ?
Joong Won .
Yes , I know . I know what you 're going to say . I 've already heard it more than a thousand times .
The ultimate excuse that a living person can make .
That the living ... must go on living .
That 's right . The living must go on living .
I know that very well myself , so stop giving me that advice .
The fact alone that I 'm still alive and well is a testament that it 's not my fault ... that 's what I 'm afraid others will think .
I know that 's how you also view me right now .
- It 's just that I 'm worried about you .
- Yes , I know .
You don 't need to worry .
One thing that I can tell you with absolute certainty ... is that I never ... not even for a single moment ... thought that it was my fault .
Is that the spirit of a young girl who died too young still roams around this earth .
Don 't you even feel the least bit sorry to her ?
Do you still feel that guilty ?
You didn 't see the perpetrator 's face at all ?
Cha Hee Joo .
Are you okay ?
What 's going on here ?
Are you okay ?
Joong Won .
I 'm sorry for all of this .
Joo Joong Won .
Because you ended up dying like that ... it put me in a very unfair position .
Cha Hee Joo .
This incident had nothing to do with that other incident .
But ... there 's someone in Joo Joong Won 's vicinity that 's causing me some concern .
It 's a woman .
Hey , new girl .
You said your name is Ms. Tae , right ?
How old are you ?
New girl , why don 't you tell us a little about yourself ?
No , I don 't want to !
Excuse me .
Ma 'am ...
Isn 't today ... your father-in-law 's memorial ?
That 's right !
Oh my gosh , I had completely forgotten about it .
I should get home early today .
But , Ms. Tae . How did you know about that ?
I just ... I thought that I heard you speak of it earlier .
Thanks .
I 'm going to have to rush .
I think that there 's something strange going on here .
Should I do an exorcism ?
- Wait , that woman ...
- Woman ?
No , that lady over there .
I think it 's that lady from that other day . - Who ?
- The girl that ruined Tae Yi Ryung 's wedding .
Really ?
Tae Gong Shil .
I 'll remember that .
Ms. Tae Gong Shil .
Are you going to be done soon ?
Yes , we 're almost finished here .
Then why don 't we go home together ?
Excuse me ?
We both live at the same place .
So , let 's go home together .
I 'll wait for you outside .
- Oh my goodness !
- Are you two dating ?
- Do you two live together ?
- You guys are already living together ?
When did you two get married ?
- Oh my !
- Must be nice !
- They 're already living together ?
- Are you living with him ?
He wants me to go home with him ?
Do you see something again ? Excuse me ?
Do you see something again around my expensive fountain ?
No , I don 't see anything .
Don 't show yourself anywhere near me .
Excuse me .
What is it ?
Why are you talking to me ?
Um , I 'm sorry for everything .
Had I known that there was that kind of pain ... I wouldn 't have told you that I saw that woman , Cha Hee Joo hovering around you .
Pain ?
I just brought up the old memories and guilt for nothing , right ?
Guilt ?
I 'm sure that she was standing beside you to tell you to forget the past , and that the living must go on living .
It wasn 't your fault .
The thing that you say you can see ... can you conjure it up ?
Why ?
If you can conjure her up , then do it .
I have something that I have to tell her .
What 's that ?
'You 're ... ' 'A .. ' 'Bitch ' .

[ Next Episode Preview ]
Your useless senses that no one else can see is absurd .
Get lost .
- President Joo !
- Oh my goodness .
- Please open the door .
- I 'm not going to open it .
Get lost .
That 's my shoe .
My shoe !
She followed me like this .
You really are crazy , aren 't you ?
- Those tears are a lie .
- Tae Gong Shil , don 't ever show up again .
- Joong Won .
- You 're a bitch .
- Joong Won .
- What are you ?
It 's me .
The bitch that you hate .
You 're ... A ... Bitch .
- Did you ... just swear ? - That 's right .
Relay it just like that .
Relay this message to the ghost that you see .
You must blame her a lot for leaving you behind all alone .
So , you liked her that much ?
Enough to swear at her ?
If I happen to see her again , I 'll relay it to her . I 'll tell her that you still like her a lot .
Don 't twist things around in your head .
It 's an insult just like how it sounds .
- ' You 're a bitch . '
- I know .
She 's a bad person . A very bad person . That 's what they all say when they miss someone very much .
No , that 's not right .
If you 're going to relay it to her like that ... then just get lost , Ms.Tae.
But , it still makes me so happy to know that you believe me .
No , I don 't believe you .
So , don 't be happy .
I 've been so lonely and scared all this time .
Meeting you was like a ray of sunshine .
You have no idea how reassuring it is to know that I have a place to escape to whenever I get scared .
That 's not right either .
You 're telling me that I 'm your place of escape ?
Go ahead and try knocking on my door .
I will never open my door to you .
Please open it .
- No , I won 't open . Never .
- You 're the only form of escape that I have .
I 'm just so scared .
Please open up for me .
Episode 3 .
It 's a designer brand .
What is this doing here ?
Is there only one shoe ?
I wonder if the lost and found department is still open .
Give it back .
Give it back .
- That was ...
- I heard it , too .
Are you okay ?
- Yes .
- What happened ?
I tripped on something up there .
What 's going on here ?
Hi , Kang Woo .
She said she fell down the stairs .
Can you try moving your foot ?
It hurts a little .
I didn 't see anything up there that you could 've tripped on .
I 'm positive that there was something up there .
The floor is slippery . The floor is still waxy .
The cleaning team needs to re-clean the floors . - Right now ?
- Right now .
Team Leader Kang Woo can take Deputy Ahn to the hospital .
Yes , I understand .
I guess we won 't be able to go home together tonight .
I have to clean up around here , too . Please take her to the hospital safely .
Then , I 'll see you at home .
Yes , I 'll see you at home .
- Kang Woo and I live ...
- Forget it . I 'm not curious to know .
Deputy Ahn said that she has some files that she needs to get to the Vice President .
I think I need to go get them from her .
Go ahead .
I can get myself home . - Will you be alright ?
- Of course .
That startled me .
What is this ?
Have I never driven this car before ?
Here I thought I was going to go home like the rest of the normal people .
It 's a shoe .
It 's so pretty .
I want to go on dates with men wearing shoes like these .
I wonder if the other shoe is around .
Sear ... ch . Home .
Okay , I got it .
I figured it out . I figured it out .
You did good .
You did good .
President Joo !
Please open the door !
- Please open the door !
- I 'm not opening it . - Get lost .
- President Joo !
What is it ?
What is it that you 're getting so worked up about ?
Master .
This is huge !
Thank you .
What did you do with your other shoe ?
And what 's with the shoe in your hand ?
The owner of this shoe is chasing after me .
The owner of this shoe ... must be dead .
It seems that she died instantly at the moment of impact .
You think it was drunk driving ? She must 've been pretty out of her mind ... to drive with only one shoe on ? Take a look .
- Please pull your skirt down .
- Excuse me ?
What are you doing ?
Mind your own business and go away .
Please stop what you 're doing .
If you continue , I will have you arrested .
I know you .
How could you have manhandled me like that ?
Anyone would agree that your behavior looked very suspicious . This is my car .
I need to buy something , but my manager isn 't around right now .
When I looked down from my hospital room . I noticed that the sunroof was left open so I came down here to get some money .
That round container in there ...
I have my money in there . My money !
That 's what I was trying to get .
- That 's what you need ?
- Yeah .
- There 's only 1,000 won in here . - Huh ?
Really ?
What is it that you need ?
Two bottles of soju , one dried squid , and one dried cuttlefish .
Did I get it right ?
You even had the squid grilled ? How very sensible of you .
If you can handle drinking two bottles of soju by yourself ... why are you staying at the hospital ?
Fine , I 'm faking it .
I 'm doing it because I was stuck in a jam , and I had no other choice .
Why ?
- Are you going to tell the reporters ?
- No .
I understand that you were stuck in a jam .
Are you pitying me right now ?
If you 're pitying me because I was left at the altar , then don 't do it .
Aren 't you doing all this so that you could gain people 's pity ? Just tell me what your number is .
I 'll send you the money for this .
No , forget it .
I hope that the soju will be a better remedy for you than your hospital stay .
Did he just refuse my offer to exchange numbers ? How nonsensical .
- Are you Choi Yoon Hee 's husband ?
- Yes .
Is that my wife ?
I 'm sorry , but she didn 't make it .
Yoon Hee !
Are you sure that the woman who died is in there right now ? Yes .
Should we go ?
You .
Are you really going to go in there like that ?
I don 't have my other shoe .
It 's actually rather cushy and comfortable because there are still some tissues left in there .
I 'm not talking about your sense of action , but I 'm talking about how you look .
Aren 't you even embarrassed ?
No , it 's okay .
There was a time when I got so scared at the bathhouse that I just ran out of there and had to go home wearing a cardboard box .
So , something like this doesn 't embarrass me at all . Let 's go .
You .
If the owner of that shoe isn 't in there you 're going to admit yourself in this hospital with that tissue box on your foot .
I really don 't like coming here unless I absolutely have to .
Where are you saying the owner of that shoe is ?
There .
Now that you 've seen with your own eyes , do you believe me ? Imagine how scared I am all the time ?
I 'm telling you that ghosts really do exist . Doesn 't that scare you ?
No , I 'm not scared .
What does it matter when I don 't see them myself ?
I don 't use my imagination on useless stuff .
I 'm telling you ! She chased after me like this !
- Don 't do that .
- Don 't do what ? - She appeared out of nowhere like this !
- Don 't do that .
Okay , fine . I bet it 's scary for you .
But when I hold onto you like this ... I don 't see them anymore .
Can you now understand why I 'm always hanging onto you ?
Joong Won doesn 't let just anyone get close to him .
He 's calculating the feasibility and the fit of the type of women that he wants to be with and he won 't relegate himself to spend his time with anyone he doesn 't deem worthy .
And just like anything else he does with his life and business ... he 's rather picky .
So , what you 're telling me is ... that you don 't think that he 's distancing himself away from women because of Hee Joo ?
In other words , it means that he has yet to meet a woman who 'll be beneficial to his business ?
Since he has a calculator for a brain , I 'm sure he 'll make the right choice .
But there are those rare people who just can 't be figured out with normal calculations .
It 's not because of your money ... or your good looks . It 's because I can see ghosts .
I 'm not a candy girl who 's out to seduce you .
Are you a Christian ?
Sixth sense , or intuition . Are you telling me you have that ?
Yes , it 's unexpected , isn 't it ?
I thought you were some gold digger , but it 's just your intuition ?
If the reason why you stick yourself to me is because of those ghosts ... I mean , those beings ... then what 's the reason for those being hanging onto you like that ?
They come to ask me to do things for them .
They 're not like living people ... who can formally explains their situations and asks you for your help .
They always show up out of nowhere to tell me what they want me to know and they keep coming around me until I do what they want me to do and torment me to the point where I can 't even get any sleep .
What is it that the owner of that shoe wants from you ?
She wants me to give this shoe to her husband .
She told me to tell him that she 'll be watching over him .
That man probably is the shoe owner 's husband , right ?
I know that guy .
He 's one of the shop owners at Kingdom .
Really ?
Then she must 've lost her shoe when she came to see her husband .
This must be very special to him .
She 's dead .
I 'm telling you , she 's dead .
This truly is a miracle .
She took it upon herself and died .
The way her husband was smiling was even scarier than the ghost herself .
When I got so scared earlier and ran away ... I forgot to take one of my shoes in my haste to run away from the ghost .
That 's what it must 've been like for her .
What do you think it was that she saw ... when she left her shoe and ran away ?
I don 't use my imagination on useless things .
I have a feeling that she saw something that made her very angry and upset .
She 's dead .
I 'm telling you , she 's dead .
This truly is a miracle .
She took it upon herself and died .
If I told him that his dead wife was watching over him ... then I bet he wouldn 't be laughing like that , right ?
Let 's go .
Okay , good luck with that .
Go find out what injustice he did to her , and get revenge for her , too .
Where are you going ?
You have to come with me . - Why would I ?
- I can 't go back there without you .
I 'm scared of her . I don 't know what other ghosts may come up to me .
- I need you . - Ah .
I 'm your special shield , isn 't that right ?
You said that you can 't see them when you 're touching me , right ?
You said you want to run to me and cling onto me when you 're scared .
But by any chance ... do they ever give you any useful information ?
Like what the stock market is going to be like in the morning or where I can dig to find all the oil ... or where are all the countless numbers of lost treasure chests buried at ? And if nothing else , do they tell you what the next lottery winning numbers will be ?
Then , I don 't need you .
Your intuition that only sees and hears useless things holds no value to me . Zero .
But , let me give you one piece of advice based on what I 've seen and heard here .
Because you go around doing what you do , in other people 's eyes ... You 're just a crazy woman walking around with that tissue box on your foot .
Someone who doesn 't even know how to be embarrassed .
Get your head on straight ... and just worry about yourself .
President Joo ... you know that I 'm not crazy .
- You saw it for yourself and believe me .
- No . I 'm only going to see what I want to see , and believe only in what I want to believe in .
I 'm just going to see you as a crazy woman , and I 'm not going to believe anything you say .
Seriously !
Do you know what 's going to happen with the stocks tomorrow ?
Can you even tell me what the winning lottery numbers are ?
You can 't even tell me anything .
Why don 't you let me know some of these things before you ask me for my help ?
2,000 won ?
Again ?
What 's this ?
I did have the shoes .
It is sturdy .
Nice and cushy , too .
They don 't seem bad to wear .
What is this ?
It fell apart .
It fell apart ! What do I do ?
All the tissues are falling out .
Tae Gong Shil .
Kang Woo .
What are you doing here ?
I 'm on my way home after dropping Deputy Ahn off at the hospital .
I was at the hospital , too .
Is she ... okay ?
Yes .
- What 's that ? - This ?
I lost my shoe .
I look like a crazy person walking around like this , don 't I ?
Wearing a tissue box to protect your foot is a proof that you 're a quick thinker .
Right ?
I wore it because I had to .
I 'm not wearing it because I 'm crazy .
But it 's falling apart , and I don 't know what to do .
What do I do ?
I think that tissue box is dead now after having completed its mission .
I think we need to call in some reinforcements .
I see a taxi heading this way . Why don 't we share it ?
My defense line is wounded , but I found myself some new reinforcements .
No , nothing .
You 're diverting from your path .
I know .
Be quiet .
I shouldn 't have seen those .
But ... did she sprint home with the tissue box on her foot ?
Where did she go ?
You 're diverting from your path . I got it .
I 'm just going to go on my own .
Turn right .
What is this ? Right turn again ?
Then it wasn 't the right place earlier ?
Your wife was driving with only one shoe on her foot . I thought she was drunk driving , but she wasn 't .
- Is there a problem ?
- No . I just thought that it was weird that she was driving while wearing only one shoe .
Kim .
Is he saying that something bad happened to my daughter which caused the accident ?
Please calm down , Mother-in-law .
I 'm sure she must 've lost her other shoe somewhere .
I 'll look for it .
Did you look for the shoe ? You didn 't find it ?
Okay .
Thanks for bringing me back home .
If you 're thankful , would it be okay for me to ask you something ?
What is it ?
The special person at Kingdom Enterprises that you spoke of the last time ... is it President Joo Joong Won ?
Yes .
Is he also the reason why you started working at Kingdom ?
Well ... yes .
I saw that he came all the way here to visit you the other day . Do you two have a special relationship ?
I wanted to know if it 's okay for us to be coming home together like this .
We wouldn 't be able to do that if you 're his special woman .
I 'm not that kind of a special woman .
To President Joo ... I 'm just ... a crazy woman .
Then , let 's continue to go home together like this .
Thanks for everything today .
Who is that man ?
He 's the Team Leader of the security team at Kingdom Enterprises ?
- And he lives in Room 404 ?
- Yeah .
Does that man ... know about your mental state ?
If he knew , I doubt he 'd suggest going home together after work .
Gong Shil . The reason you 're like this ...
may be because you lack energy .
Why don 't you get closer to that guy and charge up some of your energy ? My energy ?
You see it all the time in period dramas .
When a righteous woman sleeps with a man she is said to have dirtied her energy , and kicked out of her household .
The fact that you see those things ... could be a sign of weak energy .
Who knows ? Maybe if you receive some of a man 's energy , things might get better ?
Maybe you 're right ?
I wonder if that man is special to me because he has really strong energy ?
That man ? Who would that be ?
- There 's just someone .
- Whoever it is , just let him give it to you .
Suck him of his energy , okay ?
How am I to do that when he won 't even let me touch him ?
Let 's suck on 404 's energy for now .
Hurry up and go to sleep .
You have to get to work in the morning so that you can come home with him tomorrow .
I can 't go to sleep .
What if I fall too deep in sleep and have it taken from me like the last time ?
Is ... something in here right now ?
Our summer revenue figures are doing great . Kingdom is really climbing up .
Giant Mall will be opening soon .
We need to come up with a plan of attack to make sure that they don 't defeat us .
This store has the third highest revenue volume in this place .
Hello .
The revenue in this shop isn 't all that great . Let 's just keep going .
This store has the highest revenue volume . - President Joo .
- Hello , thank you for all your hard work .
If there 's anything that you ever need , please don 't hesitate to ask me .
- Yes .
- But please keep up your great work . Thank you so much .
That poster was made when we thought Yi Ryung was going to marry the soccer player .
Do you think it 's still okay to be hanging that up now that the wedding is off ?
Look at how fierce it looks .
That poster is going to be a great piece of advertisement .
I don 't think that Tae Yi Ryung is going to like this .
We 've already paid her for the modeling fee .
Even if she doesn 't like it ... what can she do about it ?
I like it .
[ Temporarily closed . ]
She said this was the place .
The owner of this shop 's wife died in an accident a few days ago .
Yes , I know .
This shop is our fourth highest revenue grossing store .
I think that Giant Mall has approached him about opening up a store at their mall but I doubt he 'll make his move over there since he signed a contract with me .
I 've seen something that makes it difficult for me to trust him .
Look into him some more .
Look into it .
That shop owner 's wife ... did you hear that she died last week ?
I heard that he was so devoted to his wife .
That 's too bad .
I 've seen that couple , too .
I saw that couple here on a date ... and they were planning on taking a hiking trip somewhere on their day off .
The husband seemed so kind .
The wife is extremely rich . She even opened up that shop for him , so of course he should be nice to her .
I heard that his mother-in-law is even richer .
I heard that she owns a few buildings in Gangnam .
Then let 's think about this .
Her one and only daughter is dead ... and the only person she has left is her son-in-law .
Then all her money will go to ... the son-in-law ?
He 's hit the jackpot . - Awesome .
- He 's hit the mother load .
Anyways , he 's a nice man who was really good to his wife .
So , I guess he deserves the money .
- Gong Shil .
- Gong Ri ... If I 'm the only person who says he 's bad when everyone else thinks he 's a good person ... then no one would believe me , right ?
Did you ... did you see something again ?
No .
Gong Shil .
Let 's stay here for a while and try to make a life here .
You have to do well so that you can continue to go home with that man . And you can receive his energy , too .
Okay .
I 'm sorry , Gong Ri . I 'm going to get going .
Bye .
I always feel like there 's something lurking whenever Gong Shil stops by .
Is ... someone there ?
Go away .
- Go , go away .
- By any chance ... is that woman your little sister ?
Yes , she is . Why do you ask ?
It 's just that I ... want to become friends with her .
Let me help you clean this up . I don 't know why these things fell down .
Doesn 't he have any sympathy ? How could he have hung these up when she had to be admitted in the hospital ?
Let 's go protest this right now .
- This is it ?
- What in the world is this ?
It 's not bad .
Rather than getting pitied while dressed in hospital gowns ... being seen dressed like this while kicking that ball seems to suit me better .
Are you really ... okay with this ?
I like it .
Since we 're already here ... should we find out who the woman that ruined my wedding was ?
- Let 's think about it over lunch .
Tae Gong Shil ? Why ?
Is she someone you know ?
No , it can 't be her . No way .
Um ...
Yes ?
- Are you doing okay ?
- Yes .
I can 't take a day off of work over a small injury like this .
Um ... You said you tripped on something when you fell down the stairs the other night ?
By any chance ... did you see this shoe when you fell the other night ?
That 's the same shoe that I picked up in the hallway that night .
Where did you picked it up from ?
My Yoon Hee !
So ... did you come from that way ?
No ?
That way ?
So , you fell down like this when the shoe came off ?
She ... told me that the shoe was found right here .
This is very close to her husband 's shop .
That 's where the shoe was ?
Then that 's just garbage . And you 're the cleaning crew .
Throwing trash away in the trash can is part of your job .
You know that this isn 't trash .
You know exactly what I 'm trying to do here .
No , I don 't know .
In my eyes ... you 're an employee at the risk of getting fired for your strange behaviors . And for being lazy enough to sprawl yourself on the ground like this .
Those shoes .
Don 't they look like the same pair of shoes as this one to you ?
Right ? Aren 't they the same ?
So what ?
Even if I keep denying it and say that I don 't want to know ... I can 't just ignore it when I see it .
That 's just how I am .
Again ... again ... again !
I just saw something that I shouldn 't have seen .
Honey , do you have to go hiking with your wife again on your next day off ?
I have to keep going with her so that no one will suspect me when she has an accident .
Does your wife like to go hiking ?
Yeah , she likes it .
Since she has no idea that she 's looking around for her death spot .
Honey !
Yoon Hee !
Yoon Hee .
Hear me out .
Honey .
So , you 're wearing those shoes out in the open now ?
Your wife is dead .
I haven 't been able to wear them ... because I was afraid of getting caught wearing the same shoes .
But there 's no risk of that happening now .
Be careful .
My mother-in-law is still alive .
Once that old lady is dead ... who do you think is going to get all this ?
She still looks perfectly healthy .
Who knows when she 'll die ?
She 's not doing so well since the death of her daughter .
It 'll be soon enough .
We 've got the luck on our side .
Giant Mall is eyeing all our high revenue grossing stores for their own .
We have to protect our stores .
You went around and met with everyone today .
My mouth feels like it 's about to rip from all the smiling that I had to do .
But it was important for you to go see them since they produce all that revenue for us .
I don 't know if my mouth feels like it 's going to rip from all the useless things I 've seen .
The woman that Tae Gong Shil went after earlier is the employee at the Dahlia shop .
I heard that the owner of that shop recently lost his wife and has sunken into despair .
It worries me that Ms.Tae may do something wrong .
Mother-in-law . What are you doing here ? You should be at home resting .
Yoon Hee 's no longer around to take care of you now .
So , I brought you some food for you to eat .
Mother . It 's only the two of us now .
We need to lean on each other .
Would you like to go hiking around the mountains just like how Yoon Hee and I used to go to together ?
- That 's ...
- She wants me to give you this shoe .
This belonged to your late wife .
This belonged ... to my Yoon Hee ?
She came here right before she got into that accident . She came here to see her husband ... and she ended up seeing the awful things that her husband was doing .
She was so shocked and flustered that she lost her shoe along the way .
Ji Sung ... What is she talking about ? You 're saying that my wife came here ?
No , she didn 't .
And that shoe didn 't belong to my wife .
Don 't lie .
I have no idea what she 's talking about .
Mother-in-law ... I already found Yoon Hee 's shoe .
What ?
The police brought it to me and told me that they found it at the scene of the accident .
This is my wife 's shoe .
No , it 's not .
That shoe belongs to another woman .
And that woman is in here right now . Who are you ?
What is it that you 're after ? Why are you doing this to us ?
She told me that she would be watching over you .
She told me that she has to protect you . He 's a bad man .
Look here .
Why are you doing this to us ?
It hasn 't even been a week ... since my wife died .
I wish I could follow her in her death .
I can 't even follow her in her death because I have to go on living . So , why in the world are you doing this to us ?
Could you still say the same thing if your wife was here watching over you right now ?
If my wife was watching , then she 'd know . Just how much I loved her ... and how I 'm suffering without her right now . She 'd know all that .
That 's a lie .
- Those tears are a lie !
- Lady , what are you doing !
- Have you lost your mind ?
- I saw everything !
I saw you laughing at the hospital !
- And I can see that you 're lying !
- You need to get out of here !
- Aren 't you even sorry ?
- Please leave !
Ma 'am ! That man is a bad person !
- Your daughter wants to protect you !
- Get out of here !
Team Leader .
The woman causing trouble at Dahlia shop is a member of the cleanup crew by the name of Tae Gong Shil .
Tae Gong Shil ?
- That man is lying ! He 's a bad person ! - What are you doing ?
- Ma 'am ! Wait , that woman ...
- He 's a bad man !
- Please stop this ! - Let go of me !
- It really was Tae Gong Shil .
The ' Big Sun ' who everyone said was prettier and smarter than you ?
I heard that she 's gotten really weird , and I guess the rumor was true .
She 's completely ruined .
- That grandmother is in danger !
- This woman is crazy !
Excuse me . You 're a security guard , right ? Get this woman out of here .
Is she crazy ?
Did you see what she did in there earlier ?
Let 's go , Mother .
Tae Gong Shil .
Why are you sitting down there like some crazy person ? Get up .
I said , get up .
Did you find the owner of that shoe ? Yes .
Over there .
I did find her . But he 's lying and telling everyone that the shoe doesn 't belong to his wife .
it 's not a lie .
This is my late wife 's shoe .
That woman is talking some absurd and crazy gibberish !
Then we 'll just see if this woman is crazy , or if you 're the one lying .
This is the shoe that your wife was wearing when she died .
I picked it out of the trash after you threw it away at the hospital .
- The size of the shoes doesn 't match .
- Oh my goodness , you 're right .
Your shoe ... doesn 't match .
These ... are a perfect match .
You 're telling me that these are Yoon Hee 's shoes ?
Then ... what was the shoe that you had ?
- Bring that woman out here .
- Yes .
Oh my goodness , look at her shoe !
The shoe that you lied about to keep the truth hidden ... is right over there .
You ... deceived ... both Yoon Hee and I ?
Are you okay ?
She said she 's going to continue to watch over you and see you again in your death . Just like you did to her .
Do you think that my Yoon Hee ... is watching right now ?
Yes .
The president of this place is pretty decent .
To stick himself out there to take his employee 's side like that .
That 's how normally President Joo Joong Won behaves .
I 'm Tae Yi Ryung ! Let go of me .
Let go of me .
I 'm Tae Yi Ryung .
I was trying to defend myself because you grabbed me so suddenly .
You did the same thing the last time .
I guess you 're always on guard .
Is this where you work ? Kang Woo ?
Your name 's Kang Woo ?
Yes , that 's correct . I 'm glad I ran into you .
- With what happened the other day ...
- I 'm working so I have to get going .
- Someone you know ?
- Did he just diss me ?
- What happened ?
- Master came and took care of everything .
- The president himself ? - Yes .
I 'm positive that Ms.Tae is the master 's secret girlfriend .
- I 'm sure of what I saw . - I guess you 're right .
But you don 't think I grabbed her too hard earlier , do you ?
I don 't want to upset her .
You told me that you weren 't going to believe anything and just going to ignore me . But I 'm really grateful for the help you gave me .
There 's no need for you to thank me .
All I did was get my own revenge .
It wasn 't just his own wife ... but that man betrayed my Kingdom as well .
He went against his contract and signed a contract with Giant as well .
The bastard .
All I did was get my revenge on him for his betrayal .
Was that why you watched over him at the hospital ? Because of your own suspicions ?
All I did was see something I shouldn 't have because I went down the wrong path .
What is this ?
I 'm back at the hospital .
Let 's just go home now , okay ?
I went and retrieved it because I went down the wrong path and saw what he did .
Sometimes people find the most unexpected things along their path . There are times when they find themselves in an unexpected place during their travels .
They think of it as unexpected luck , or even perhaps a sign of misfortune .
But they 're not ... all just coincidences .
You 're telling me that it wasn 't a coincidence that I got lost ?
It was a right turn .
- Right turn .
- What is this ?
Another right turn ?
Then that place earlier wasn 't it ?
Stop right there .
Don 't tell me any more useless things .
President Joo .
I 've been giving it some thought .
And I think I 've figured out a way to make myself very special to you .
You say you 're going to make yourself special to me ?
Why ?
Are you going to tell me the winning lottery numbers ?
Cha Hee Joo .
She 's a very special person to you , isn 't she ?
I ... can see Cha Hee Joo .
That 's right .
You told me that Hee Joo is around me ?
So , if you continue to stay around me ... then I guess you may get to see her again ? Yes .
If I can see Cha Hee Joo again ... then I 'll become special to you , right ?
If I see her again ... I 'll make sure to tell her .
Thank you .
See ...
Hee Joo again ?
Is there ... anything that you realized after this incident ?
What about me ?
Even if the first thing you noticed about me was my money ... it doesn 't really matter to me . Honey .
All you need to do is make sure that you always keep your eyes on me .
Even though beauty fades over time , and perky breasts will come to sag ... but my money will never dry up .
So ... just remain loyal and faithful as you were to me in the beginning and don 't look at anyone else .
That 's enough to satisfy me .
I 'll never ... change the love I have for you . I see only you .
Okay .
If I see that you 're turning away from me even in the least ... I won 't show you any mercy . I will just get rid of you .
That will never happen .
Never .
Hello .
Here , why don 't you drink this ?
Our security team is going out to dinner tonight . Why don 't you come join us ?
Dinner out ?
Where you toast your drinks , and go sing at the karaoke bars ?
Yes , of course .
I do want to go , but I ...
If it 's the security team , will Team Leader Kang Woo be there as well ?
Yes .
Gong Shil , let 's go . Let 's go and receive some of that energy .
Gong Ri , you know I can 't drink .
There 's going to trouble if I lose grip on my mentality .
You can skip the drinking , and just have snacks . Sure .
Then you 're coming , okay ?
I don 't mean anything else by it , but I just want us to be friends . I 'm serious .
Come on , let 's go .
Let 's go .
Cheers !
The atmosphere seems so much livelier with you here .
What do you think of me , Gong Shil ? What do you think of my style ?
Are you trying to flirt with her ?
Settings like this depends heavily on the compatibility between the men and women here .
How about I take this opportunity to make you a frequent fliers card ?
If you come to three outings , you get a free meal .
If you come five times , you get a free night of drinking on us .
And if you come ten times ... blind date ?
How about a blind date ?
Since Ms.Tae Gong Shil can 't drink , how about a soda for you instead ?
Here , why don 't you have a soda ?
Non-alcoholic .
- Everyone grab a drink , and cheers !
- Cheers !
Hey , Gong Shil . You look tired . Why don 't you go relax over there ?
Come on , get up . Can you scoot over a little ?
Here , lean back and relax .
I wonder if I 'm just tired .
Why does my head hurt so badly ?
Are you okay ?
Yes .
I 'm having a great time .
It 's been a really long time since I 've been out with other people like this .
Are you not feeling well ?
- Could it be that you 're drunk ?
- I didn 't have anything to drink .
I 'm too scared to drink .
Because I become a whole different person when I get drunk .
Most other people gets that way when they 're drunk .
But I really do ... become a whole different person .
Cha Hee Joo .
What you said about you liking me because I come from a rich family ... did you mean it ?
Are you ... hesitating right now ?
That 's pretty offensive .
I just pretended to think about it so that you don 't feel offended .
If I admit it right away ... then it would only hurt you .
Joo Joong Won , are you angry ?
I know that you 'll stop being mad at me if I call out your name three times .
Joo Joong One .
Joo Joong Two .
Joo Joong Three .
It 's not the least bit funny .
Even though you may not find it funny , you 're no longer mad at me , right ?
Bitch .
It 's that woman .
I told him that I 'd get him to meet her again .
That woman I reported to you about the last time does seem to have a special relationship with President Joo .
I will continue to watch her and see if she has anything to do with Cha Hee Joo . And what else she may know .
Tae Gong Shil ?
Why are you here ?
How did you find out where I live ?
You hitched a ride in my car , and came into my Kingdom and now you dare to ring the doorbell to my house ?
Didn 't I warn you ?
Did I not tell you to stop ?
Joong Won .
Joong Won ?
You 've completely lost your mind .
- You 're mad at me , aren 't you ?
- Yes , I am . I am mad at you .
You 're fired .
Don 't ever show yourself in front of me again .
Get lost .
Will you stop being mad at me if I call out your name three times ?
Joo Joong One .
Joo Joong Two .
Joo Joong Three .
That 's not the least bit funny . You .
What are you ?
It 's me .
The bitch you hate .
Thank you .
Sorry , I have to keep holding on to feel calm .
Let 's go .
- Is this far enough ?
- Yes .
Is this far enough ?
I don 't think a ghost followed me .
There aren 't any .
Then why are you still holding on ?
My hand just keeps going towards your body .
I 'm not an object that you can touch however you please .
Of course . You 're a very expensive man .
I thought you wouldn 't let me touch you because you were mad .
Thank you so much for helping me .
I 'm valued at a very high cost .
So be careful .
That 's right . I 'm just someone valuable who sees ghosts .
You 're valued high for now , but if you go overboard , your value goes down .
Then there will be serious consequences .
Yes , I 'm sorry .
I was just trying to make you feel comfortable .
Don 't bother .
All I need is your sixth sense to get in touch with Hee Joo .
I understand .
I went overboard .
I 'll just focus on using my sixth sense , nothing else .
You 'll start work tomorrow . I 've found you a position .
Really ?
I 've always gotten fired because of the ghosts .
I never thought I 'd find work again .
Thank you , President Joo .
I 'll work really hard to look out for ghosts from now on .
I 'll be here to protect you so do all that you can .
Yes , I 'll do well .
But the salary ... will you really deduct from my pay if I touch you ?
Holding hands is 100,000 won . Hugging is 1,000,000 won .
I took it all out from your salary .
Wait , I think that 's too much .
100,000 won .
I won 't touch you so carelessly .
I 'm warning you to be careful .
If you keep touching me , you 'll never see your salary .
You should only touch me when absolutely necessary . Calculate well .
I understand .
So expensive ...
Doesn 't matter if you 're uncomfortable .
The truth is , you need me .
No matter how expensive my body can protect you .
But if you put it that way , you need me , too .
I 'm the only one who can connect you with Cha Hee Joo .
That 's right .
I do need you .
That 's right .
You feel like you 'd die without me , right ?
Without you ... I 'd feel inconvenienced .
- Then hear me out ...
- Get lost .
President , you were joking about the salary , right ?
If I were kidding , you would be laughing .
100,000 won .
Not even worth a bottle of champagne .
1,000,000 won .
I hugged her for not even the price of a refrigerator .
I was too cheap .
Was President Joo here ?
He was so cool before .
Hey , come to your senses .
He didn 't hug you because he liked you .
He was making the ghosts go away .
If you keep thinking like this , it 'll get dangerous .
Well , I guess it 's possible for two people to feel nervous around each other .
You see ghosts , but that doesn 't mean you are one .
Okay .
Today , I 'll hug you a lot .
1,000,000 won ! 2,000,000 won ! I love you .
Hey ghost , go away .
Like it ?
Episode 5
We found the perfect wife for your grandson .
How old is she ?
Is she about Ji Woo 's age ?
She 's the same age as Ji Woo .
And she died at the same age as Ji Woo .
I prepared these for Ji Woo 's wedding .
I checked both their histories and picked a date for the wedding .
I can feel that Ji Woo 's soul is near .
If we can find a suitable match for him , he can leave peacefully .
Ji Woo . If Grandma does this for you , will it make things easier ?
It seems your grandson does not approve of the lady .
I 'll come back once I find someone more suitable for Ji Woo .
Kang Woo !
They delivered milk !
Are you going to have one ?
- You guys can have it .
- Thanks .
Kang Woo , that lady got a job at the same place you work .
She just left .
A job ?
She says she doesn 't think she 'll get fired this time .
You should protect her .
She says that scary people follow her around and bother her .
What kind of people ?
You 'll know when you see her later .
Be brave and don 't run away .
Protect Gong Shil .
You said you like her .
I like her , but she doesn 't like me .
Keep on drinking .
If we 're brave and don 't run away , we can keep drinking the milk .
Drink .
Go away .
Stop following me !
Let me live ! Stop bothering me !
What ?
Who is it ?
- Did he go this way ?
I 'll buy you coffee .
Come back later .
Kang Woo !
Kang Woo ...
Kang Woo ...
I think I lost him .
Who was it ?
Was it a thief ?
It 's not a big deal .
Don 't worry about it .
Seung Mo said there was someone who kept following you around .
Well , it 's sort of true ...
I did think something was strange .
You always seemed uncomfortable and were wandering around .
That 's why you take the long way back home , right ?
Gong Shil , by any chance ... are you in debt ?
Are the people following you around loan sharks ?
No .
Then what is it ?
Well ... the things that are following me around ... are ghosts .
There 's one right next to you now .
Kang Woo !
What 's bothering you ?
He 's ... a ghost ... a ghost-like stalker .
Stalker ?
He keeps following me around and bothering me .
Have you reported him ?
Should we go to the police station ?
No , I don 't want to go to the police .
I found a way to live with it . You really don 't have to worry .
Then should I help you out ?
I know how to get rid of stalkers .
Are you saying you 'll be my bodyguard ?
I 'm grateful for the offer , but you won 't be able to do it .
I 'm pretty good though .
I won 't charge you .
Then ... can I depend on you ?
It 's Ms. Tae .
Looks like Kang Woo is with her .
The sun is shining bright for her first day of work .
The sun is too bright . It 's giving me an annoying fever .
President Joo gave you a job . I guess he doesn 't think you 're crazy .
He trusted me with a very important job .
Are you helping him with something personal ?
What kind of work ?
Well the thing is ... So ...
It 's President Joo 's car .
I 'm late .
I have to go !
Hello , President Joo .
Tae Gong Shil .
You 're as fast as a ghost .
Of course , I have to get to work before you . Since I am your secretary ...
Secretary ?
Who ?
You ? According to who ?
Did Mr. Kim say so ?
I didn 't say anything to her .
Aren 't I working here as your secretary ?
This is not where you 'll be .
Then where will I be ?
This is the place .
But this is a storage room .
This was a room for the VIP members , but there isn 't any use for it anymore .
So , now we use it as storage .
What will be my responsibilities ?
Officially , your title is ' Advisor for Special Customer Services ' . but in reality , you 'll be cleaning up the storage room .
Ms. Tae seems disappointed since it wasn 't what she expected .
Really ?
But it suits her just fine .
'Advisor for Special Customer Services ' .
How can I advise any customers here ?
Why is my first customer a ghost ?
I said I 'd get you coffee !
Do you know that woman ?
She 's Chinese , and she 's renowned for her matchmaking skills .
She only arranges marriages for the wealthy dead .
Dead people ?
Marriages for the dead spirits .
If there is a dead child in the family , she 'll find a worthy match and arrange the marriage .
She 's a ghost matchmaker . They call her ' Madam Go ' .
Wealthy families sure do strange things .
I hear you got a room for Bang Shil .
Where is it ?
We got her an office , not a room .
And it 's Gong Shil , not Bang Shil .
I love you .
Center for special customer services ?
There 's such a department at Kingdom ?
There is .
The room is hard to find , but it kind of looks like a garage .
Anyway , good for you .
It 'll be bad if weird things visit you there .
It 's already here .
It is ?
One for you ... One for him ... I think he 's addicted to the coffee here .
He keeps following me .
He 's my first customer .
If he 's your customer , take him to your center for coffee .
He likes it here .
I 'll go now .
You should visit .
Hey !
Now what ?
Hey , why do you ask for coffee and never tell me how you died ?
Tell me .
How did someone as young as you die ?
Tell me .
Someone who has one foot in the spirit world .
This lady will do .
I spoke with the president of Giant Mall yesterday .
I 'm guessing you weren 't just exchanging greetings .
We also exchanged information .
The president of Giant Mall has a lot of business leverage .
He 's thinking of partnering with Mrs. Wang for the Shanghai distribution .
Mrs. Wang of the Shanghai distribution ?
I heard she gave up on business after her grandson died .
The president of Giant Mall is making an empty partnership .
Is he trying to build a lie ?
But still , it would be worth looking into .
Mrs. Wang could be Kingdom 's VIP member .
Oh , about the Center for Special Customer Services that you set up ...
Someone had paid her a visit already .
Just letting you know . Not bad , right ?
Your aunt stopped by to ask me for a favor .
Work ?
She said to go visit Chairman Wang .
Chairman Wang , I heard her grandson died not long ago .
What if you see him there ?
Do you think so ?
Then , I don 't think I can go .
No , if you see him there , go meet him .
What ?
Ask him about his grandmother 's business plans .
Ask him if she has any plans to join Giant .
But I 'm scared .
Is President Wang an important person ?
Very important .
Ask her no matter what .
Since she 's important to you , I 'll go .
But I won 't be able to sleep if I see something scary ...
You have me to protect you .
Do well .
If you 're scared , I 'll hold you .
Madam . This is the lady .
Can you please change into these clothes ?
You want me to wear this ?
It 's a favor .
I 'm not mentioning that girl because it 's better than hanging onto Hee Joo .
She seems a bit lacking , but she seems pretty normal .
She 's definitely not normal .
She 's doing work I 've asked her to do , so please don 't give her extra assignments .
I didn 't give her extra work .
Madam Go asked for her particularly , which is why I sent her .
Madam Go ?
She 's the woman who arranges spirit marriages for those who 've passed .
Seeing that she 's taking her to Mrs. Wang , the rumors must be true .
What rumor ?
I hear she 's on the lookout for a wife to pair up with her dead grandson .
This is amusing . Ghost rumors .
But why would she insist on taking Bang Shil with her ?
President Joo .
I was a bit scared , but now that you 've called , I feel better .
Are you okay ?
What did you see there ?
Oh ... her dead grandson .
I think he 's inside this house .
I saw his portrait , and he was very young and handsome .
His grandmother is sad he spent all his time in the house sick .
He never go to be in love .
What are you doing there ?
They asked me to put on some clothes , so I tried it on .
Clothes ?
Why 'd they ask you to do that ?
I don 't know . It 's a very pretty dress , the kind you see in movies .
They mentioned it was a Chinese cheongsam for weddings .
A what ?
Why would you wear that ?
Take it off and get out of there .
Why ?
Get out . Right now !
But you said it was important .
I 'll see what I can do before I leave .
Tae Gong Shil .
Tae Gong Shil !
Whatever .
She 's not a real employee anyway .
Since it 's important to you , I 'll go .
She should get out if she 's afraid of ghosts .
Why is she doing everything I ask her to do ?
Whatever .
Whatever !
I think it was here .
Is this the dead grandson 's room ?
It 's locked .
Please open !
Please open !
Please spend the night in this room .
Who are you ?
Please open the door !
Even though you 're not dead , you 'll be able to do it .
So , that he can be at peace , please stay here with him .
Ma 'am , we have a visitor .
What are you doing here President Joo ?
I 'm here for my employee who came to make a delivery .
Where is she ? Do presidents come directly to look for their employees ?
If she was just any employee , you wouldn 't have especially requested for her .
I invited her here to ask her for a favor .
I 'll take good care of her , so please go on ahead .
Who is she with ?
Is it your dead grandson ?
It 's something important to me .
Get out ! She 's an important employee .
I 'll stick around .
- Where is she ?
- What ?
I said where is she ?
Open it .
I said open it .
Open it .
Open it for him .
You 'll regret it if you open it .
Your financial advisor paid me a visit .
I can join forces with you .
It 's all in your hands .
What are you going to do ?
- Then I will ...
- President Joo ...
Go back in .
I 'm here .
President Joo , you 're here .
She opened the door .
I didn 't .
It 's all ruined , Ma 'am .
Ma 'am , your grandson has a message for you .
My Ji Woo ?
I 'll just say it verbatim .
Grandma , are you senile ?
Just stop it !
And tell that lady to get lost . She makes me want to puke !
It 's my Ji Woo .
We have to take measures of precaution before Joong Won falls for Bang Shil .
I 'm thinking of slowly pairing him up with a better woman .
Who ?
There 's someone .
Explode like the fire from the propane !
Raise it .
Raise it up .
As if you 're the fireworks .
Passionately . Like it 's consuming your body .
Raise your dress up .
- Raise it up ?
- Way up !
Stretch it up !
- Then wither down . - I 'm not doing this .
Wait a minute .
Let Yi Ryung drink some water .
- How much left .
- Just one more scene .
What ?
My arm is about to fall off .
I 'm only going to hold the lid .
Miss Yi Ryung .
The original concept was a wedding , since my wedding was called off , we had to changed it .
You have a lot of issues now that you 're wedding is canceled .
If only your friend had not interfere with your marriage .
My friend ?
Didn 't I tell you ?
I meant to tell you .
The lady who got your wedding called off was your high school friend .
She works at Kingdom now .
Is it Tae Gong Shil by any chance ?
So , it was Tae Gong Shil ?
A business deal fell through . Then someone in the family got sick .
All the misfortune was blamed on Ji Woo .
The business didn 't do well because of the global economic crisis .
Everyone has a sick person in the family .
How did it become all about ghosts ?
Because of ... that .
It 's because of that .
It 's been 100 days since Ji Woo passed , but the flowers are still fresh .
As time passed , everyone began to fear this fact .
He 's waiting for someone he likes .
That never even crossed my mind .
He was sick since he was a child .
He had no friends because he was always in the hospital and this house .
He also had a temper , so no one got close to him .
This is too hot !
He was always a sensitive child .
That child ... had this girl that he liked .
I want to meet her for once as well .
You will be able to meet her .
Right ?
I don 't know . I only know this kind of person .
My employee will visit here back and forth and find out about it by talking a lot with your grandson .
Didn 't you say she 's an important employee so you have to take her with you ?
Not at all .
The only thing important to me is you , Ma 'am .
Anyways , I will say it again I did not open the door .
How much are you looking into the investment in China ?
I will need definite details from Kingdom . Then , I will consider it .
Our team will ...
Miss !
I think my employee saw something .
Excuse me ... who is the person that came here just now ?
The kid who came to deliver milk ?
Was the milk delivery kid close with the grandson here ?
I didn 't know who he was ...
Oh , the boy who delivered last time ... spoke a lot with the young master , and they also played games together .
Did you find out who it is ?
I think so .
Who is the woman that this family 's grandson waited for day and night ?
It 's ... not a girl ... It 's a guy .
I think he 's waiting for the milkman .
A guy ?
Miss ?
- Did you figure something out ?
- Yes , well ...
No , Ma 'am . She says she still doesn 't know .
We will come back tomorrow .
Let 's go .
President Joo .
How can you just leave ?
She 's waiting , shouldn 't we let her meet him ?
Are you telling me to drop a bomb on that grandma 's face who 's expecting to see her grandson 's beautiful first love ?
No , I 'm not trying to find the ghost 's first love .
The important thing is to make that grandma feel happy .
So , what are you going to do ?
The first love ... with the eyes of a pretty nurse in the hospital ... or with a teacher who taught piano ... let 's split the fee with that in half with the ghost .
But that 's a lie .
You said you didn 't like lying yourself .
When I made up the story about Hee Joo didn 't you say that you didn 't like lying ?
That kid is so pitiful .
He has no one and he 's waiting for the person that he liked .
I want to let him meet her .
But , I 'll do what you say .
Either just leave like this or go inside and tell her . Make a decision .
Go .
Find the milkman .
Instead ... let 's not make it sound like it 's his first love . Let 's just say it 's a friend .
Tae Gong Shil , come fast .
I will crush you .
- Are you the stalker ?
- What is this ?
Tae Yi Ryung , you again ?
Get off , you jerk !
I 'm acting like this only because I shot my commercial today or else you 'll be sued .
There 's no scratch .
It 's going to swell up .
Then why did you come to vent out on your friend about your canceled wedding ?
I didn 't come to vent out but to take revenge .
But looking at it , it doesn 't seem to be a victim 's revenge .
What are you going to do ?
I 'm going to tell her to watch out , I 'm going to steal the guy .
The guy ?
President Joo .
I 'm going to flirt with him and declare war to make her cry her eyes out .
You don 't think I 'll be able to do it ?
I 'm Tae Yi Ryung ...
So , you 're going to war , but a secret weapon ... is important for battle .
Should I do that ?
You 're going to help me ?
But , there 's a condition .
Find out the reason why President Joo is interested in Tae Gong Shil .
Why are you curious about that ?
Do you perhaps like Tae Gong Shil ?
Well ... let 's say I do .
Wait , I think it 's turning blue .
Hey ! Why are you talking down to me ?
I could just tell you look younger than me .
You sure do look older than me . Want me to treat you like an old person ?
Fine . Talk in that familiar form .
Now that we 're on the same side ... want to go for a drink to commemorate ?
Drink by yourself .
It 's that guy from before .
Excuse me , I 'd like to ask you something .
You deliver milk in the neighborhood up there , right ?
Do you happen to know the person who delivered there before ?
The person 's over there .
It looks like him .
He looks sturdy .
Excuse me !
Yes ?
You know Ji Woo , right ?
Ji Woo ?
Who 's the person that used to deliver milk to that house ?
I did . I 'm the one who used to bring deliveries to Ji Woo 's house .
He said it was a guy ...
There was a lot of misunderstandings like that before I grew my hair out .
She may look like a girl , but she 's totally a guy .
She 's the one , right ?
So , you 're the one that Ji Woo is waiting for .
Hey , delivery !
Shouldn 't you deliver it properly ?
The milk is all squashed .
Even though it 's squashed it still tastes the same .
Even though it tastes the same , I don 't like it looking ugly . Just like you .
I don 't like being unlucky either . Just like you .
What ?
What are you doing ?
Delivery , you 're really a girl after all !
An ugly girl .
It 's fortunate .
That she 's a girl , how fortunate .
I am aware of what happened to Ji Woo .
I don 't want to really talk about it . Please leave .
There 's something we really wanted to show you .
It 'll be great if you can go and take a look .
It 's a very pretty flower .
A green rose .
There are many kinds of roses .
And many colors , too . Then are there green roses as well ?
I like the color green .
We do have green roses .
Awesome , they must be pretty .
They 're not pretty at all .
They look like cabbages , just like you .
Hey ! If I grow out my hair and doll up , I 'm fine too .
Why do you keep saying I 'm ugly ?
You look ugly .
I can 't even tell if you 're a guy or a girl .
I think being weak is girly .
As I expected it was not good with a tomboy like you .
Hey .
Don 't cry .
If you cry , you 'll get uglier .
I don 't cry over a guy like you who 's weak and grows flowers .
I really don 't like guys like you .
Ji Woo .
Ji Woo .
They 're very pretty .
You lied saying they were ugly .
I wanted to show you too , so I grew out my hair .
But you died , like a fool .
Farewell .
Farewell , my baby .
Farewell .
The meaning of a green rose is a noble love that exists only in heaven .
It 's fortunate that Ji Woo , that girl and the grandma found out about the truth , right ?
We unveiled a very big secret today .
You did your part , too . So , I 'll drive you home today .
Oh , no .
I don 't want you to go all the way to the front of the study room .
If I ride in your car , it may be awkward if I bump into a certain person .
Oh , you mean Kang Woo ?
- You guys live together , right ? - Yes .
Kang Woo has a lot of interest in me . He 's really curious about what I do next to you .
It 's a bit awkward to give him an answer .
It seems like you 're hiding the fact that you have unique radars from Kang Woo .
That 's right .
He keeps asking me what I 'm afraid of .
I told him that it was a stalker .
So , he said he 'll be my bodyguard .
Are you perhaps bragging right now ?
It 's all thanks to you , President Joo .
Going to work and meeting people .
Stop the car .
- I could go a little further .
- No , I don 't want to go any further .
I shouldn 't have been too accommodating to you ...
Get lost , here .
Okay .
Well then ...
What the heck ?
You said it was free so I didn 't want to just leave .
Then ... goodbye .
Let 's go .
How come I don 't feel afraid after touching his hand ?
Why is that ?
They don 't look like ghosts , but why are they following me ?
- Miss ! Come with us .
- What are you doing ?
Who are you ?
Let 's go !
Let go , let go !
Kang Woo . Are you okay ?
Are those people the ones following you around ?
They 're people , but why did they follow me ?
That 's enough .
I came to see you again . But it looks like I won 't be able to .
You shine too brightly .
That 's why the creatures of the darkness follow you .
I shine brightly ?
They may complain and make a request . You must be alert .
Amongst them , there are some who are looking for a chance .
The chance to come back by using you .
'Darkness will swallow the light ... ' [ Chinese phrase ]
Darkness will swallow the light and death eventually swallows life .
Be careful and don 't get swallowed .
Mom said she was coming now .
Seung Joon , didn 't you hear what I said ?
Seung Joon !
Seung Joon !
Seung Joon !
Seung Joon , where are you ?
Seung Joon !
Seung Joon !
You have to tell me where you 're going .
It 's a doll .
You can 't .
We don 't know if someone left it there .
If it 's still there later on , then that means it 's been thrown out so let 's take it then .
Let 's go .
How did you meet that swindler ?
While working .
You 're not explaining in detail once again .
Anyway , it was worth waiting over there .
Do you really like me ?
You like me , so that 's why you want to know more about me ?
The reason why I can 't say everything about myself is because I really like it when someone likes me .
They might run away if they find out .
You 're thinking what kind of big secret does this woman hold that she 's trying to scare me away , right ?
Is she perhaps a spy ?
A criminal ?
Or is originally a man ?
Various things come to mind , right ?
But ... you 're going to be even more surprised than whatever it is that you 're thinking of .
I warned you . Don 't come any closer .
Thank you so much for today .
Don 't say thank you .
It just makes me feel bad .
You 're not the only one who has a secret .
There could be something I 'm not saying as well .
After listening to your warning ... I am kind of scared that I might disappoint you as well .
Sleep tight .
He says he likes me so much , should I just tell him ?
Kang Woo , I see ghosts .
How can I say this ?
Chairman Wang will be holding hands with my kingdom .
It 's an innate choice .
She said she 'll hold my hand as well , she said to go to China with her .
So ? - Are you going ?
- I can 't .
You 're here .
It 's too bad , but I declined .
So , is that why you don 't have any strength ?
Do you really regret declining Chairman Wang 's offer ?
It 's not that , it 's something else that I got rejected .
That was very regretful .
And what is that ?
The person who likes me .
Thank you .
Thanks .
Hold onto your mom 's hand , well .
Thank you .
Come this way , please .
I can 't say that I can see ghosts .
He says that he likes me , so I can 't say it even more .
If it can 't be then , I just want to pretend to be an a normal person .
But ... I 'm so depressed . Why do I have to see ghosts ?
Tae Gong Shil .
You look more like a normal person than the first time I met you .
Probably think it 's because you 're arrogant ...
I 'm so funny , right ?
It 's because I have some room to breathe . So , I have a lot of time to think about things . I got greedy , too .
Humans want more if they can live .
That can happen .
Thank you , President Joo .
You have become an air defense for me . And a counseling room as well .
You ... brought Chairman Wang and broke off the deal with Giant Mall .
So , I 'll give you a discount .
Thank you .
But I feel so depressed today , I really don 't want to see ghosts today .
Can you tag along , when I go home ?
Humans bite into it , when they think it 's the right time .
That cannot happen .
Okay .
- What 's the occasion ? - There wasn 't enough .
But you know Tae Gong Shil who worked with us ?
The reason why she went to customer service was because she received President Joo 's special attention .
- President Joo ?
- They 're that close ?
There are a lot of evidence already and also a number of people who saw them ...
Lee Han Joo 's mouth is quite loud , so the rumors are spreading faster than expected .
President Joo should probably hear it by now .
We have to connect like ...
- Didn 't Gong Shil have a lover ?
- She did . A lover ?
Oh , you know she comes to work and leave ... with that employee who works on the security team
Then , it 's a love triangle ?
Who is it ?
The security team ?
Hey !
There 's guy who lives together with Tae Gong Shil on our security team .
Who is the person she grabbed and dragged to go home together ?
Not only that , he 's also her personal bodyguard .
Really ?
Tae Gong Shil is trash .
But with her dark circles hanging , how can she seduce men ?
Right ?
I 've been watching from afar , but looking at it closely it seems they 've grown very close together .
Possessing the mind is the way to seduce them .
In that Loreley Hill myth , men jumped in to die .
Anyways , who is that guy ?
It 's me .
Pardon ?
The one preparing to dive on the hill is me .
It 's not easy jumping in .
I would need to brave .
You would need enforcements .
What is trash ?
Sorry .
Only deliveries are coming in , instead of the customers .
This is a storage house .
Tae Gong Shil .
- Mr. Kim .
- Yes .
When we leave later , we 're taking Tae Gong Shil with us .
Yes , Sir .
I want to know you .
I will bring up the courage . So , you should cheer up . I will bring up the courage .
So , you should cheer up .
President Joo .
The person who likes me said he will bring up his courage for me .
He told me to cheer up .
And ? So , you 're going to cheer up and go ?
Yes .
I want to try to go .
I want to go .

When I touch you like this ...
it doesn 't affect you , does it ?
Right ?
You . Do you really think that I 'm just a deflective shield made out of marble ?
There 's no way that can be the truth .
I 'm not totally unaffected by it .
Then do you ... you know , something happens to you , too ?
I 've always felt a little something .
You just ... with me ... you just touch me much too freely .
I haven 't said anything before because I didn 't want to sound weird since you seem to think nothing of it . But now that you 're finally starting to react like a normal person . I 'm going to ask a favor of you .
When you use me as your shield I want it to be a casual touch so that people will think that we 're good friends .
I don 't like it when others look at us as if we have something going on .
This is ... to be used in friendly terms .
And this stuff ... it makes people question . Do you understand ?
Yes , I understand .
To be honest , I didn 't give much thought to whether you liked it or not all this time . I pushed myself on you just so that I can survive .
I think that I will be more careful from now on .
Careful , I have to be more careful .
Yes , be more careful .
Be more cautious of stuff like this , too .
From now , I 'll listen to all your ghost stories . So , don 't go trying to face things alone and end up like this anymore .
Worrying about things like this is what friends do .
Any closer ... and it makes people wonder what 's going on .
- Do you understand ? - Yes .
Let 's go . I 'll take you home .
No , it 's okay . I 'll just go home on my own .
You were locked up in jail .
You even got yourself hurt today . That much concern is allowed .
Get in the car , and I 'll take you home .
I have to be cautious .
I just picked up something strange on my radar now .
That 's why you should grab onto me .
Use me .
No , it 's okay .
Are you ... being cautious because you don 't want 'Kang-candy ' to see me bringing you home ?
No , I 'm just being cautious .
I have nothing to be cautious of .
If we run into ' Kang-candy ' on our way , he 's not going to wonder because I 'm going to tell him that we 're just close friends .
So , don 't worry about it and come .
Do you know what a good thing it is for you to be good friends with the boss ?
Even ' Kang-candy ' won 't be able to do anything about it .
It has been confirmed that President Joo got himself involved in Tae Gong Shil 's issue . That 's why he was taken to jail earlier today .
I 'm positive that Tae Gong Shil has something to do with the late Cha Hee Joo .
I didn 't pick up on that sooner because I let my personal feelings get in the way .
I 'm sorry for the slip-up .
Cha Hee Joo was an orphan .
If that woman also lost her parents early ... then could it be possible that they met in an orphanage when they were young .
I 'll look into it . And one more thing .
See if that woman Tae Gong Shil has ever spent any time in Europe .
Yes , Sir .
Kang Woo . I sensed that you may have developed an interest or feelings for that woman .
Are you okay ?
I will be .
Don 't try to be too strong , and tell me if it gets too tough .
When you 're not being honest with your heart ... the pain you feel will give you your answer .
Do you think this is going to pain you ?
I will ... put an end to my feelings for her .
President Joo .
Thank you for everything today .
Since you stayed in a jail today , make sure to eat some tofu when you get home .
I don 't eat stuff like that .
Okay , I 'll be going then .
Goodbye . Tae Gong Shil . Didn 't you say that you picked up something strange on your radar earlier ?
- Did something follow you here ?
- Ah , that wasn 't anything scary . It 's just something that needs to be scolded .
So , I 'm going to talk to it and set it straight .
Drive home safely .
Let 's go .
He 's not the candy , and you 're just his radar !
Get yourself together .
Ever since meeting Tae Gong Shil ... I 'm popping these bitter calming pills like they 're regular vitamins .
Ugh , so bitter .
I need water .
Since you stayed in a jail today , make sure to eat some tofu when you get home .
Does this look like tofu ?
When I touch you like this ... it doesn 't affect you , does it ?
That woman only holds my hand when she sleeps . She sure does worry a lot about needless stuff .
Ugh , so salty .
Since I 'm not picking up any scary ghosts with my radar lately am I resorting to other absurdities now ?
Touching him on the face like you did earlier is a form of sexual harassment .
It 's no different than touching someone 's butt in the subway .
Grandmother from the supermarket , why are you here again ?
How am I supposed to get any sleep when you 're standing there staring at me like that ?
Since you 're already here ... can you just scare me once so that I can come back to my senses ?
Enough , enough ! That 's enough !
No , you can stop it now .
Stop , just stop it .
President Joo .
I heard that you were dragged off to jail because you got yourself in something that doesn 't even make you any money ?
I was really shocked when I heard that .
I was really ... shocked myself .
I don 't have much to say since I heard you did a good deed ... but ever since Bang Shil came into the picture , you 're doing things that you never used to do .
Even your father has somehow heard about it . he asked me who she was .
That 's an even more shocking bit of news .
Do you keep him updated with reports on me ?
No , not me . We only talked about golf the last time we spoke .
I 'm sure he was asking others about you . He must 've heard of it from someone else .
It 's a given that a father should be interested in his son 's affairs .
Receiving such obvious interest for the first time in 34 years ... is throwing me into a shock . I don 't even know how to handle it .
I 'm sure it 's because your father 's getting older now . So , he 's starting to get more interested in what 's going on in his son 's life .
Don 't you think so , Honey ?
Yes , of course .
He 's at an age where he wants to become a grandfather now .
President Joo . I hope that you really succeed this time .
I 'm not sure .
I don 't know if meaningless physical relationship would produce a grandchild for my father .
Grandmother .
I 've returned to my senses , so can you step out of the trash can ?
Okay ? No , don 't . Please don 't roll your eyes back into your head like that .
Please get out of there .
Kang Woo .
Are you heading out to exercise this late at night ?
Yes , I 'm going out for a run .
I know that we were supposed to come home from work together tonight . I 'm sorry for having left without you .
Something suddenly came up that I had to tend to .
Tae Gong Shil .
I 'm going to tell you this because I think it would be best to set things straight .
When I told you about me liking you ... that was just a misunderstanding .
Excuse me ?
I said it as a joke to the other guys , but you took it to be real . I felt really bad about it so I didn 't tell you the truth .
And when you told me that you were grateful that I liked you ... I tried to see if I could make myself like you . But , I don 't think that I can do that .
I 'm sorry .
Ah , I see .
I knew something wasn 't right about it .
This is embarrassing .
Then you should 've told me the truth from the beginning .
When you gave me that candy , and those musical tickets ... it threw me into a tizzy of my own . I just ended up making a fool of myself .
Even though you accepted that candy , and those musical tickets ... I know that you don 't really like me . Isn 't that right ?
Someone I respect once told me that when I 'm not being honest with my heart ... the pain I feel will give me my answer .
And it seems to me that you 're not in any pain over me .
Then is it okay ... for me to feel less sorry ?
You have to go get the ball .
Hey , what 's wrong ?
Someone ! We need some help over here !
Over here !
Wake up .
Please wake up .
This is the third pool accident at Kingdom Enterprises .
She said that there was something under water that pulled on her leg but there was nothing in the water .
It 's not like there 's a water ghost . Just what could it be ?
Are you positive that someone else just didn 't play a prank on her ?
I saw the video footage of the incident . It wasn 't a prank played by another person .
It 's still the middle of the summer , and a weird rumor like this is floating around ... this could mean that we may lose all our customers to Giant Mall .
We can 't allow for that to happen .
I should ... put my radar to work in the swimming pool .
Giant Mall is taller than my building .
Chief Secretary Kim !
Hi , my ten billion won radar .
I need you to turn on your radar .
You . Were you up getting bothered all night ?
Your dark circles are about to dig their way into the ground .
The grandmother from the supermarket came to visit me last night . So , I didn 't sleep a wink .
President Joo .
Do I look sick ?
You ... always look sick .
But especially today . You look like a zombie .
It 's not like you 've ever seen a zombie in real life .
You 've never said anything about a zombie but you have told me that you 've seen a water ghost before , haven 't you ?
Yes .
Once , I went down to Han River with my sister to eat some rotisserie chicken . I almost drowned when I got lured into the water by a water ghost .
Water ghost .
I never want to see the water ghost again .
Never again .
I really hate the water ghost . I really hate it .
It 's so scary !
Grab on .
No one 's ever caught a water ghost before .
Water ghost .
She 's really terrified by it .
I almost feel bad about sending her in there to catch the ghost .
President Joo wanted you to use that to go there on your next day off .
Gift certificate for Kingdom hotel ?
- Isn 't this a really nice place ?
- He put several of them in there for you . He wants you to take some friends and have a good time .
He was telling me earlier that I looked like a zombie .
He 's sending me to a place like this so I can go and get some rest ?
Yes , he is .
I 'm so happy .
I gave it to her .
She was very excited and told me that she 'd go tomorrow .
Okay .
I 'll get her to go there first ... and tell her to look once she 's already there .
Okay .
Kingdom 's hotel is super fancy .
I can 't believe it .
I have a few more certificates ... if you want to take some more friends you can take them with you .
In that case ... should we ask ' 404 ' to come with us ?
Okay , let 's just pack our bags .
Make sure to pack a lot of pretty clothes , because we 'll drive up in my car .
Gong Ri , I 'll take lots of pretty pictures of you , okay ?
Gong Shil . I 'm so happy right now . This is so great .
Hey , isn 't there a swimming pool at the Kingdom hotel ?
Let 's pack up our bathing suits too , okay ? This is so great .
Doesn 't it creep you out knowing that there could be something in the swimming pool ?
There 's nothing in there . It 's not like we have a Loch Ness Monster .
What did you call me out for ?
I 'm not someone who can be called out so easily for a meeting .
Thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to come meet me .
What is the favor that you have to ask of me ?
I need you to find something about Tae Gong Shil that 's not in the records .
You can find out who her close friends were and find out if they 've met her parents , and what kind of relationship they had , right ?
Why do you want to know about her family ?
Do you want to marry her ?
If I wanted to marry her , I wouldn 't check up on her like this .
- I 'll just ask to meet her family .
Then is this work related ?
Surveillance ?
If that 's the case , then I will help you .
Why don 't we talk about this some more over a meal ?
Do I have to have dinner with you for you to help me ?
No , it 's not like that .
I was just offering to let you tag along since it 's almost time for dinner .
If that 's the case , you don 't have to include me .
Find out what you can and call me .
Hey !
I already made the dinner reservation .
Why is he being so picky for someone so average ?
- Chief Secretary Kim . - Yes ? Do you by any chance give my father reports on me ?
I haven 't spoke to him since he went back overseas after his trip home last year .
Why do you ask ?
A father who never once showed interests in the women I might have consider marrying is all of a sudden showing interest in Tae Gong Shil .
- And I find that very strange . - I 'm sure it 's just a fatherly interest .
That 's ... just absolutely absurd .
What about Tae Gong Shil ? Is she on her way to the hotel ?
Gong Ri , this place is amazing .
Hurry up and get down here . Okay .
I 'll get on the road as soon as I 'm off work .
Enjoy yourself until then , okay ?
Where are you going ?
You don 't need to know .
I 'm a career woman myself .
Why do I have to go around doing background checks on Tae Gong Shil ?
Look at what I 've got .
Come hang out with us and bring Kang Woo , okay ?
You want us to tag along to where the Tae Sisters are going to play ?
I want to hook Gong Shil up with Kang Woo .
I 'll owe you one if it turns out well .
Should I report this to the Vice President , or just go play ...
Let 's just go play .
Yes , I should just go play .
I don 't know if it 's because this place is so big but for some reason , I don 't feel scared here .
There 's a fireworks show tonight ?
They can 't have a firework show in the middle of the day and I 'm too scared to go out at night .
That 's nothing but an impossible dream for me .
President Joo ?
Where are you ?
I 'm at the hotel lobby .
This place is really nice .
Of course , it is .
The place belongs to me . The painting that you 're standing next to right now is a very expensive painting .
Yes , it does look expensive .
But , how did you know where I was standing ?
Because I 'm standing right behind you .
President Joo .
- What are you doing here ?
- I followed you here .
Did you come here alone ?
What about dinner ? My sister isn 't here yet .
Is that right ?
Let 's have dinner first .
He followed me here ?
Why ?
- Are you finished with the preparations ?
- Yes . I will forbid anyone from entering the pool area after dinner hours .
I guess we can have dinner first before we head over there .
- Where are we going ? - I 'll tell you after dinner .
President Joo must be planning a surprise event for that woman tonight .
How nice it must be for her .
I bet he rented out the whole swimming pool so they could watch the fireworks alone .
Is there anything specific that you 'd like to eat ?
Tell me . I 'll buy you whatever you 'd like .
Are you trying to buy me something good because I look weak and frail to you ?
Yeah .
Then ... I want you to buy me everything .
Okay , let 's go .
It 's been 15 years since Hee Joo 's death .
I really appreciate you not forgetting that this is where she grew up and showing us such generosity .
I can 't believe it 's already been 15 years since Miss Cha Hee Joo died .
I felt doing this is like repaying her for her death . I 've considered severing off ties with this place .
But now I feel like I did the right thing by continuing to come here for Joong Won 's sake .
This was where Master Joo first met Cha Hee Joo , isn 't it ?
Yes , it was .
Team Leader Kang Woo ?
What is he doing here ?
Chief Secretary Kim ?
- What are you doing standing there ?
- Yes , I 'm coming .
Tae Gong Ri , and Tae Gong Shil ... Our orphanage never had a pair of sisters by those names before .
Why are you coming along when you can 't get Kang Woo to come ?
Team Leader Kang Woo had to work , and I never back out on my plans .
Then why don 't you pay for the gas ?
Maybe next time .
It 's Kim Dong Soo .
Someone you know ?
You two have the same thing !
Who is he ? An asshole who disappeared after scheming me out of my money .
I think I just got a whiplash .
Are you following him ?
You can 't do that .
- We have somewhere else to be .
- Shut up and hold tightly onto your seat .
It 's carbonated water . Since you can 't drink alcohol , you can just drink this instead .
Thank you .
Getting some rest at a nice place like this is helping your dark circles diminish .
- It 's nice to see .
But ... don 't you have any other clothing ?
My sister is bringing my luggage . She just called to tell me that she 's going to be a little late .
Excuse me a moment .
She needs something to change into once she 's out of the water .
Do I have to get that for her , too ?
Hey , I heard that President Joo Joong Won closed off the pool tonight to host a special event during the fireworks .
Wow , I don 't know who the woman is , but it must be so nice for her .
- To be jealous is to lose .
- I wish I can just go on a date .
A surprise event ?
Could it be possible that he 's planning something for me ?
Are you heading back to your room ?
Let 's meet at the lobby again in two hours .
But we 've already had dinner .
Is there going to be something else ?
There 's something very important that we still have left to do .
I don 't want you to get too angry even if you 're really caught off guard .
Okay .
President Joo rented out the swimming pool ... and I 'm the one he 's going to be meeting in two hours .
Then ... did he rent out the swimming pool for me ?
Make sure that no one else can come in once I 'm in there .
Yes , Sir . And send all the prepared items to the guest room that I mentioned earlier .
Coming .
- What is this ?
- It 's from President Joo Joong Won .
It 's so pretty !
So pretty .
Then the important thing that President Joo mentioned ...
President Joo .
Did you prepare all this for me ?
That 's right .
There 's more .
Look .
You may go in .
President Joo is waiting for you inside .
Did he really rent out the swimming pool so that no one else can come in ?
Yes , that 's correct . He 's instructed me not to let anyone else other than the two of you in there .
I 'm here because there 's a problem with the hotel swimming pool .
I 'm not here to play .
Yes .
I 'll figure out what 's in the water , and will be back once I take care of it .
Yes .
It shouldn 't take long .
Hi , my ten billion won radar . We need to turn on your radar .
You told me that you 've seen a water ghost before , right ?
Yes .
Tae Gong Shil .
Tae Gong Shil , where are you going ?
Give me a minute .
That was a close call .
I almost totally humiliated myself .
Good thing I didn 't fall for that act .
But why ... why do I feel so upset ?
When your heart isn 't being honest ... your pain gives you the answer .
Can I get you anything else ?
Like what ?
Flowers , champagne , or whatever else you need . Just say the word , and I 'll get it for you .
Forget it .
I think she 's misunderstood about something .
- She must 've been kicked out of there .
- I guess it wasn 't a romantic event for her .
You changed your clothes .
Yes , I figured this would be more comfortable .
You looked pretty in the dress .
Let 's go .
It 's okay . There 's nothing scary around here .
There may not be ghosts here , but there are people 's watchful eyes .
Those people are wondering about what 's going on between us and you know we can 't have that .
I don 't care whatsoever what those people think .
All I see is how what those people are saying is getting to you .
Tae Gong Shil .
You 're upset , aren 't you ?
Yes .
You really did look like a candy girl the way you ran out of there all dressed up .
Yes , you 're right .
Think about it . If you invite a girl to a place like this , and buy her fancy dinner and clothes then any girl would think you want her to your candy girl .
You should 've just told me to do my job as a radar .
- Why go through all that trouble ?
- You told me that you were scared .
I am your shield after all .
I felt bad ... for forcing you in there ... when you told me how much you hated it .
Was that what you were doing ?
If that 's the case , I do feel a little better .
Let 's go catch the water ghost .
Let 's go .
I 'm okay now , President Joo .
Let go of my hand if you think you can do it .
This doesn 't bother me at all .
I think they 're all expecting a heartbroken girl .
But I don 't want to give them what they want . Let 's go .
You 're quick .
I asked all the girls whom Gong Shil is closest to .
They told me that Gong Shil and her sister had really caring and loving parents .
I recorded the phone conversations .
- Want me to play it for you ?
- No , send me the audio files .
Anyways , thanks for your help .
Hey !
This makes me feel like a total spy .
I 've always wanted to be in a movie like that .
Aren 't you a singer ?
I 've been in a movie , too .
Have you never googled me ?
You can find me easily on the internet .
How long are you going to keep following me around ?
Salary man , you don 't even have a car , do you ?
I 'll give you a ride in my car .
Come on , I 'll give you a ride .
I 'm going to take the subway .
That brat !
Taeyang . We 've been sitting here for a while now .
Have you seen anything ?
No , I don 't see anything .
I wonder if it 's in the water .
I think I 'm just going to look for the ghost in the water .
Just wait a little bit longer .
It could show itself once it gets a little later in the night .
Just like how the anticipation of getting a shot is the scariest part it 's the same thing with the ghosts . They 're scarier when something is about to happen rather than actually seeing it .
And I want to get this over with before the fireworks starts .
I 'm just going to go in and look for it .
Will you be alright ?
Water ghosts are really scary .
Once they get a hold of you , they drag you down and never let go .
If I don 't resurface , you 'll pull me out of the water , right ?
Forget it , don 't do it .
Go back to the room and get some rest while you watch the fireworks .
What about the water ghost ?
We should just take care of it while the swimming pool is empty .
I 'll just drain the water out of the pool and wait it out instead .
Let 's just forget it and go .
You almost fell in the water .
It 's right there . There 's a lady over there .
I 'm so scared !
That must be his house .
I 've got you now , Kim Dong Soo .
I 'm going to get all my money back , and tear you to pieces .
He 's married .
But ... I thought you were going to tear him to pieces .
Honey , have you seen Tae Yi Ryung 's latest video ?
Ugh , I don 't like her .
She can 't even sing , but she flaunts herself around as a singer .
No kidding .
She was pretty when she was younger ... but now that she 's older , you can tell how many plastic surgeries she 's had .
I know , you totally can .
She 's a has-been .
She 's totally getting shoved aside by all the younger and prettier girls like IU .
She 's over the hill now .
Let 's get off at the next station .
Hello , my name is Tae Yi Ryung .
- It 's Tae Yi Ryung !
I 'm still pretty successful .
IU ?
Thank you !
Please show your support for Tae Yi Ryung !
Why ?
I was having fun .
You 're really ... a bad singer .
You think ? But I still looked pretty , right ?
- You 're a total lunatic .
- Yeah . That 's why I 've decided .
Let 's date .
No , I don 't want to .
How can you cut me off right away ?
You have dog-like manners .
Hey !
- Wow , it 's Tae Yi Ryung .
- Wow , it really is her !
The water ghost ... is a lady ?
Yes .
She 's right over there .
Over there ?
- Yes . - What is she doing over there ?
She 's putting her makeup on .
Her makeup ?
Who is a ghost going to impress by putting her makeup on ?
Something feels very strange .
The lady is leaving .
If she 's a water ghost ... then shouldn 't she just stay in the water ?
I don 't think she 's a water ghost .
What ?
What is it ?
She went that way .
What took you so long ?
That lady took a shower , took a steam bath in the sauna and she even knocked on the bathroom stall before going in .
- Are other ghosts that polite ?
- I don 't think that she knows she 's dead .
Where is she right now ?
She 's heading up the stairs right now .
The lady is seated in that chair over there and is having a meal right now .
So , she 's not staying just in the swimming pool ?
She 's wiping off her mouth right now .
I think she 's getting ready to leave .
- Where is she going now ?
She 's reading a magazine .
What is this ? Is she taking a tour of the hotel right now ?
She just went into that room .
That 's the most expensive room in this hotel .
- Excuse me .
- Yes ? Are there any guests staying in that room right now ?
No , that room is vacant right now .
Open the door .
What is that lady doing in this expensive room ?
She 's sitting over there by that window and elegantly sipping on a glass of wine while staring out at the skyline .
She 's acting like she 's still alive .
If she 's acting like a living person instead of a ghost then why is she doing in the swimming pool ?
Since she doesn 't know that she 's dead I think maybe she 's just shoved people out of her way while swimming in the pool .
Go tell her that she 's dead and tell her to check out of this hotel .
- Go on .
- Okay .
Ma 'am .
I really am sorry to be the one to tell you this . But you can 't keep going around doing what you 're doing .
What did she say ?
Did she get the point ?
She says she won a contest for a stay so she has the right to be here .
She showed me the same voucher that I have .
She 's a contest winner for a weekend getaway here ?
He name is Kang Gil Ja , and she won a spa giveaway contest .
- Is it her ?
- Yes , it 's her . Of all the guests we 've had here , I remembered her the most .
- Hello , are you Ms. Kang Gil Ja ? - Yes , I am .
Please follow me .
It 's so nice in here .
I wish I could live in a place like this every day .
I remember how happy she was the whole time that she stayed at this hotel .
If she was that loyal of a customer I understand why she still hasn 't been able to forget about this place even in her death .
What do you mean , dead ?
- Who 's dead ?
- Ms. Kang Gil Ja .
We know that she passed away .
No , you must have misunderstood .
She 's still alive .
- What do you mean , she 's still alive ?
- Where is she ? I heard that she 's at the hospital .
Is that possible ?
I 've never had this happen before , so I 'm not sure either .
She 's perfectly fine . So , why isn 't she waking up ?
What do you mean , she 's fine ?
She collapsed from exhaustion while getting your birthday dinner ready . So , how can you speak of her like that ?
Why are you yelling ?
Dad , you 're the one who got drunk that night and just passed out .
You have no room to talk .
You were always being a brat to your mom .
But ... why isn 't she waking up ?
Ma 'am , you can 't continue to be like this .
You have to go back to your body , or you really could lose your life .
I don 't think she wants to go back .
What did you say her daughter 's name was ?
Joo Yeon .
She 's responsive to the name .
Excuse me , Lee Joo Yeon 's mom ? You can 't stay here .
Your family is waiting for you .
You have to go back to the living .
Would you like to go ?
You 've made the right decision .
It no longer fazes me at all ... to see her acting like that .
- Okay , okay .
- Okay .
I guess she got the point .
The lady is going to go back to her body .
She says she wants to see tonight 's fireworks before going back .
I 'll go down to the swimming pool and watch the fireworks with her .
She already changed her clothes .
I 'll be back .
Tae Gong Shil .
The ghost got herself all dressed up for the occasion . You shouldn 't let her show you off .
Since this is her last time , should I dress for the occasion with her ?
She looks really excited .
It 's been forever since I 've seen fireworks .
I bet it 'll be really beautiful .
Ma 'am ...
Ma 'am , wait for me .
I 'll come with you .
People are watching .
Instead of speaking to the lady , pretend that you 're speaking to me .
Shall we go ?
This was ... a wonderful dream .
But I guess ... it 's time for me to wake up now .
Mom !
- Honey !
- Gil Ja , are you okay ?
Are you finally awake ?
Mom , can you see me ?
Mom , I 'm so glad that you 're awake !
I 'll be a really good girl from now on .
Thank you so much for coming .
Thank you so much .
Is Ms. Kang Gil Ja liking this ?
Yes .
She says she loves every bit of it .
This feels like a midsummer night 's dream .
She said that being here was like a dream that made her forget everything else .
It felt thrilling ... and made her happy . But she said it was painful , too .
Because she really loved what she saw here .
The lady 's gone .
Since when ?
Just now .
Since I can 't see ... I can just take your word for it , right ?
Yes .
The fireworks is over .
Tonight , I ... I shattered someone else 's nice dream .
Tae Yi Ryung 's surprise subway appearance ?
I had no idea that he would be married .
Hey !
I got the schedule for your business trip to China .
- How long will I be gone for ?
- For a week .
A week is a pretty long time .
Should I tell her about it ?
Ms. Tae already knows about your trip .
She knows ... and she 's fine with it ?
This is what Ms. Tae told me .
President Joo is like a special gift voucher that I won at a contest .
It 's unbelievable luck on my part .
But that 's not a place where I can stay forever .
If I 'm to be able to live well on my own , I have to get used to being without him .
I knew it .
All that nonsense she spouted off the other night wasn 't about her own feelings but Kang Gil Ja 's love for my hotel .
I let it affect me for nothing .
Are you upset by it ?
No , not at all .
Hearing that she doesn 't need me makes me feel lighter and happier .
'When you 're not being honest with your heart ... the pain you feel is your answer . '
Ms. Tae also told me that .
She told me that 's how ... she found her answer .
When you 're not honest with your heart , the pain you feel is your answer ?
I 've heard those words before from someone else .
Who would that be ?
Cha . Hee . Joo .
When you 're not being honest with your heart ... the pain you feel is your answer .
I have to be beaten back to my senses . Is that what you 're telling me ?
That 's right .
Since you like me much more than I like you ... it 's a given that your heart should be in bigger pain than mine .
You 're saying that if I want to like you , I should be in pain ?
Yes . I 'd like for you to be in an awful lot of pain , Joong Won .
Where did you hear those words ?
Did you by any chance hear them from Hee Joo ?
No , I haven 't seen Hee Joo .
How did you know the words that Hee Joo used to say to me ?
I heard those words from Kang Woo .
Bring me Team Leader Kang Woo 's resume and portfolio again .
Yes . By the way , President Joo ...
When I went to drop off the donation at the orphanage where Cha Hee Joo grew up ... I saw Team Leader Kang Woo there .
Team Leader Kang Woo had a stellar resume and he came highly recommended , so that 's why I scouted him .
Is there a problem ?
Who gave you the recommendation ?
- That 's ...
- Was it ... my father ?
You 've known about it ?
Your father told me not to tell you about it . I didn 't think that you 'd like knowing that he had a hand in who you hired so I stepped in as the middle man . I was just trying to considerate of you both .
From now on , don 't split your consideration in half and whether you choose my side or go to his side just pick one side ... and stick to it .
I heard ... that you were sent here by my father ?
I was instructed to investigate those that surrounds you in your life .
Why ? He said late Cha Hee Joo 's co-conspirator may try to approach you again .
Why ?
He believes that someone that Cha Hee Joo knows was a co-conspirator of the kidnapping and may come around you again . He believes that Cha Hee Joo was a co-conspirator of the crime , not the victim .
Is he right ?
Did you really not see the kidnapper 's face ?
I want you ... to give me your honest answer first .
The ransom that they demanded ... did you really pay them ?
Do you think that Hee Joo died ... because I didn 't give them the money ?
If that 's not the case ... then why are you nervous that I might 've seen the kidnapper 's face ?
You believe whatever you want to believe .
And you , Father ... you can believe whatever you want to believe as well .
Why is he so curious about that again after 15 years has passed ? Tell him to come and explain his reasons to me .
And one more thing . Since he told me to believe whatever I want to believe ... tell him that I believe that the lost necklace wouldn 't be found in my father 's possession .
And there 's one more message that I want you to relay to him . I 'm working hard to find the necklace ... so I hope that he 's not the one to find it .
I wonder what Kang Woo 's relationship to Cha Hee Joo is .
Cha Hee Joo .
What 's wrong ?
What happened ?
Cha Hee Joo was just here .
She told me . She told me why she 's a bitch .
I knew that you 'd find out one of these days since you can see her . That she was ... one of the kidnappers .
Who else did she say it was ?
Did she tell you who are her co-conspirators ?
She won 't tell me .
What ?
She told me ... that she needs to protect that person .
Okay .
I want you ... to be in a lot of pain , Joong Won .
Tae Gong Shil .
Don 't go .
Stay here with me .
I don 't want her to see me like this .
Since you can see her ... stay with me ... and protect me .

You will get strength .
Kang Woo !
Kang Woo !
In order to come tell you my secret , I got strength .
Say it , I will listen to you with courage .
I ...
I ... see ghosts .
Over here is a ghost .
Over there is a ghost .
The ghosts pop out everywhere .
That 's why I 've been running away like a crazy lady .
Is it okay with you ?
Even if you tell me that you got abducted by aliens , I don 't care .
♫ I 'm all about ♫
Kang Woo !
Isn 't it possible for dreams to come true ?
Episode 6
Since you compare it to a dream , you must be acknowledging that the possibility of it coming true is slim .
But it 's not impossible , right ?
A long time ago at a hospital , I met this crazy man that claimed to have been abducted by aliens .
But even such a man found a wife who understood him , so they built a fortress in the mountain and lived together .
Are you , as someone who sees ghosts , looking down on a person who claims to see aliens ?
He was the one that called me crazy first .
At first , I listened to all of his stories about aliens .
I even agreed to go with him to take pictures of a UFO .
I thought we had gotten close , so I told him that I 'm able to see ghosts . But he just called me crazy !
Alright , so you must have felt indignant .
For me , it 's too bad .
If you followed that man and got captured by aliens at that time , there wouldn 't be a reason for you to be here infront of me right now .
Anyway , there are such things as ghosts , so there could be aliens as well .
But it could have been dangerous , don 't you think ?
No .
This isn 't it .
With you , something that was meant as a joke turns serious .
I feel like I 'm turning into an idiot .
Why am I listening to this kind of story ?
Do you think that person will listen to me , too ?
Like you , Mr. CEO .
Will he listen to me ?
I don 't want to lose this hard gained opportunity .
I thought there were no opportunities like this before , but it feels so good to have it .
Don 't start with seeing . Start with believing .
Pardon ?
Don 't just start telling him you can see ghosts .
Ask him if he believes it .
Make him curious about it first .
So there will be greater chances to make your dream come true .
Ah ... I will keep that in mind , Mr. CEO .
From now on , have the crazy talks with Manager Kang after you 've broken ice about ghosts .
So go and work it out with the sweet Kang candy .
Get lost .
Yes .
I see she 's happy .
Tae Yang , who usually leaves after I tell her to get lost three times gets lost at the first this time .
Mr. CEO !
What now ?
If I tell you to go , you should go .
What is it ?
Thanks for not laughing at my dreams and listening to me .
I didn 't put effort into hearing it .
I just listened because I have ear holes .
If you also have things you can 't tell others , tell me .
I will have my ears wide open and listen .
I don 't have anything else to say to you , I 'm going to work .
Get lost .
Yes .
Mr. CEO .
What ?
What ?
What ? !
Are you listening to music while you work ?
No .
Then , what is it ?
I said I had nothing else to say .
Please , get lost !
Yes .
She always makes me tell her to ' get lost ' 3 times .
If she gets stuck on the sticky Kang candy , she won 't have a reason to bother me any more .
How do I start the conversation ?
Ghosts ?
No ...
Souls or spirits ?
What 's the easiest to do ?
That was just a prank ..
Are you okay ?
That 's why I said don 't surprise Gong Shil .
What to do ?
You said let 's go visit her out of the blue and then you go and scare her ?
I was surprised , too .
I 'm really sorry .
You came out so suddenly , I didn 't know you were a person .
Then if it 's not person , then would I be a ghost ?
It 's not that ...
She has her guard up because of a harassing stalker .
That 's why you were scared like you saw a ghost .
Oh my , my ...
Ghost ?
What kind of a person can see those ?
Why not ?
I 've seen one before .
It 's hot today .
Do you want me to tell you stories of the ghosts I 've seen ?
Don 't !
Why would you do that to someone who 's scared already ?
No ,
It 's okay .
Go ahead .
What kinds of ghosts have you seen ?
Hey !
Why ?
Which one should I tell first ?
There are many .
The elevator ghost , the bathroom ghost , the army ghost , etc .
Yes , Vice President .
Just like Lee Han Joo said ,
Manager Kang and Gong Shil live in the same place .
And this place ... is really cheap .
Keep watching them .
That cheap CEO Joo said he 's opened his body , but he didn 't open his wallet ?
If he hasn 't opened his wallet , then he couldn 't have possibly opened his heart .
It couldn 't possibly be that ... he 's opened his heart to Tae Yi Ryeong , right ?
The tallest building in Shinsadong belongs to my grandfather .
To your maternal grandfather , you said your mom is the only child , right ?
Yes , and to my mother , I am the only child .
That means that ... that building will soon be yours .
I told them to clear the table after we eat chirashi . But let 's order the full course meal .
Longer .
Let 's eat for a long time .
Auntie !
The best of the all ghosts is the headless ghost that follows you like this .
Out of all the ghosts I 've heard of , the best one by far is the Kong-Kong-Kong ghost !
There will be no ghost scarier than Kong Kong Kong ghost .
- I think ... the scariest is the statue at the school that sheds bloody tears at midnight .
Because of that we couldn 't spend our night at school .
We have a statue like that at my high school , too .
Was there a mirror ghost at your school , too ?
You know ... the grudged spirit of the student who was always second place ... becomes the mirror ghost ...
We also had that ghost , in our piano classroom .
The student who always got second place at competitions ... showed up every night and played the song ...
Fur Elise !
But ...
Kang Woo , you don 't like stories like these ?
Yes , I don 't find them fun .
It 's not that you don 't find them fun . Isn 't it because you are scared ?
Look , the lettuce is shaking .
But , I heard that if you talk about ghosts , they come and listen .
What ?
They are already here .
There , behind you .
Ah , stop it now .
I really hate these kinds of stories .
How stupid !
We are just doing it out of fun .
You are really scared because you believe that they really exist .
I do not believe that they exist !
I hate people who try to scare others by convincing them that they exist .
I really hate it !
Ghosts ... spirits ... people going around saying they saw those things , I find them the most pitiful and I can 't stand them .
He detests it .
Don 't ever tell him , alright ?
That scared me .
Why do they keep telling ghost stories ?
Making me scared .
I 'm goint to go talk to Uncle and come back .
Let 's eat .
Were you taken aback by your aunt calling you out here without forewarning ?
Not at all .
When my aunt arranges dinner dates , I come and eat when I have the time .
But don 't I make you uncomfortable ?
Since I 'm Gong Shil 's friend ?
Not at all .
I was hesitant because you two seemed very close .
I feel better knowing that it doesn 't bother you .
You worried for no reason .
If you say so , I 'll carefully tell you something .
Gong Sil , that girl , is out of her mind .
You don 't know her from the past , but that girl ... she was pretty normal back then .
But seeing how she crashed and burned , I can only assume that something dramatic happened to her .
Keeping someone so unlucky like her close by ...
Tae Yi Ryeong , is the purpose for you coming here , was to place Tae Gong Shil on this plate ... and fillet her ?
Of course not .
Then , let 's continue our conversation about real estate .
Your story about your uncle 's resort was very interesting ...
Oh , yes ... the land actually belongs to my father , so I guess you could say it is a family business .
Where should we go next ?
I 'll be there before the fish stew comes out .
Yes .
CEO Joo is spending quite a bit of time with Tae Yi Ryeong ...
What was that ?
Was it over there ?
What is that ?
It was a dog , a dog .
There 's a big dog in Kingdom .
Honey , what should we do ?
A dog in a shopping mall ?
I alerted the security team , so if there is anything , they will find it .
It 's a dog , a dog .
I even heard the sound .
We have to catch it before we open tomorrow .
Go to your assigned areas and search in teams of two .
Yes .
Really ? A dog came in here ?
I don 't raise dogs .
Vice President got bit by a dog here .
Darn , why did this happen while we were out eating barbecue ?
Check if you 're missing anything .
Yes .
Who did this ?
Did a dog really come in here ?
Are you sure you didn 't lure it here ?
Oh , Mr. CEO .
You take care of the poor ghosts . Did you bring a dog to raise it here ?
No .
What is this smell ?
Did you leave meat here ?
Did the dog come here smelling meat ?
You really have the nose of a dog .
I came from eating meat with Kang Woo .
Oh , my candy .
Where could it be ?
Did it eat it ?
Ah . It 's here .
I found it .
Ca -
It broke .
What to do ?
This ... is a dog 's collar .
There must really be a dog .
I was at dinner with CEO Joo , and I followed him here because I was curious .
Things must be going according to your plan .
We had a deep conversation about your topic of interest ( Tae Gong Shil ) .
But I don 't think Tae Gong Shil means anything to CEO Joo .
When I brought her up , he cut off talks of her .
There must be a reason why he gave her a job to keep her close by .
Why are you so curious about their relationship ?
Are you concerned about their relationship because you like Tae Gong Shil ?
Let 's say that 's it .
I think things will go well for me .
I 'll let you know if I need your help .
I guess you 'll have to work overtime to catch that dog .
Do you get overtime pay ?
A few bucks ?
You know the car garage ?
Take that elevator and go downstairs .
What do you mean ?
You should escort me to my car .
I need to find that dog to get paid .
Go now .
Dog like manners .
It must be dangerous to have a dog who has bit a person running around , right ?
If we don 't find it tonight , we cannot open tomorrow .
The summer festival that I invested tons of money in will get cancelled !
I organized it so that they can all gather and spend a lot of money .
This cursed dog will ruin it all .
It ate the chips and kimbap I left .
The dog must be hungry .
What are you going to do ?
Mr. CEO , the name on the collar ...
Pil Seung must be the dog 's name , right ?
It must be .
Mr. CEO , let 's catch that dog and have the summer festival .
I 'll make sure to find that dog .
Pilseung !
( let 's win ! )
Pil Seung !
Pil Seung , where are you ?
What is this ?
I thought you would come up with an impressive strategy .
But you are just going to try to lure the dog with two sausages ?
Dogs like things like this the best .
That 's enough .
Just go home .
Wait a minute , Mr.CEO.
Mister ?
Mister , did you see a dog ?
Alright ...
What did you just do ?
Over there ... there 's a male ghost who always sits there and goes through the trash .
There 's such a thing over there ?
That man looks really scary .
His mouth are split wide like this ... and his eyes ...
Wait , what if the ghost hears you talking about him like that ! ?
I have you , Mr. CEO ...
There 's also a female ghost in the women 's restroom who is always sitting on the toilet clogging it ...
Should I go ask her ?
It seems like you ... have become intimate with many ghosts while working here .
There are ghosts that tend to stay in one place and not leave .
I was scared of them at first , but I feel bad for them .
And now that I 've seen them a few times , they 're like my coworkers .
Does that mean you guys get together occasionally and go out to eat ?
Why are you making such scary jokes ?
When they get together , it 's scary .
Going out to eat with coworkers should be like tonight ... grilling meat , while laughing and talking .
Although tonight 's dinner got ruined once the topic of ghosts came up .
Tae Gong Shil ...
Something smells fishy .
You weren 't able to come clean about your ghost-seeing ability with " sweet candy " Kang , right ?
Kang Woo says that ghosts are the things he hates most in this world .
He says he hates people who say ghosts exist even more than he hates ghosts .
What should I do ?
Why are you asking me that ?
I hate them , too .
I hate them , too , but ... I 'm letting you stay close by because I find you useful .
Alright ...
I guess I 'll be useful and help Kang Woo by looking for that dog .
I 'll go check out that restroom over there .
Stay here and wait .
Am I a mutt who waits for his owner ?
I 'm not going to wait .
If the dog had a collar , he should have an owner ...
Is the owner here with the dog ?
A man dressed in black is escaping towards District A.
The restroom ghost says she didn 't see it ...
Should I ask the storage room ghost ?
Did you lose him ?
He went outside .
That guy ... he 's a bit strange .
Why ?
Why ?
What ?
Remember that part-time worker Hyung Cheol who worked at Customer Service ?
He went to the military , right ?
Hyeong Cheol ... yes .
Why ?
It 's nothing ...
I 'm sure I saw it wrong .
Are you alright ?
Do you think you can stand up ?
My legs feel weak .
I think I sprained my back as well .
I 'll take you to a hospital .
Get up .
I sent Tae Yi Ryeong to the hospital with one of our employees .
The police have been notified .
Be sure to check if any of our stores acquired any damages before tomorrow 's opening .
What about the dog ?
Was there no dog ?
Didn 't the burglar bring a dog ?
We checked surveillance videos , but he went around without a dog .
I guess you were bit by a burglar , a person , not a dog .
Honey , it 's a relief .
At least , you don 't have to get the rabies vaccine . CEO , please step outside for a moment .
What is it ?
Mr. CEO , there 's a dog .
It was a petty burglar .
There was also a dog .
He 's right here .
Right there , is what your saying ?
Yes .
It 's really there . A dog .
He 's a handsome ( German ) Shepherd .
You sit right there !
Wow , you understand commands .
Paw !
He 's so smart !
He understands everything .
Did that dog also sneak in here like the burglar to steal something ?
I 'm not sure .
I think it 's correct that he was with the burglar ...
When the burglar was running away , I caught his eye and the dog started to follow me .
Then ... is this his collar ?
Pil Seung ...
I think it 's right .
He 's answering to his name
" Woof , woof ! " is what he said .
He has the same tag around his neck .
If he carried this around while stealing , that dog must have meant a lot to him .
The whereabouts of the armed soldier who ran away 2 days ago is still unknown .
Reporter Yoo will give us the details .
Pil Seung , what should I do ?
I think the dog wants us to go with him somewhere .
I should go and see .
Mr. CEO , if you touch me , the dog disappears !
I need to follow him !
What do you mean " follow him " ?
Tae Yi Ryeong was attacked by him and is at the hospital .
You don 't know what will happen to you if you go there .
We 've reported him to the police , so he 'll get caught .
Let the dog " visit " him later .
Don 't you think there was a reason why Pil Seung followed me instead of following his owner ?
It can be helpful if I find the burglar ...
I think you 've gone crazy trying to impress " sweet candy " Kang , but he 's a criminal .
Where do you think you 're going ?
It 's too dangerous .
You can 't go .
Don 't give me that face .
I said no .
If I tell you once , please listen .
I guess I misunderstood you .
I thought you would say " go chase that dog and find the burglar " .
Did you say you would find the burglar because you wanted to impress me ?
Thank you for worrying about my safety , Mr. CEO .
100,000 won .
Nothing 's for free .
I 'm going to deduct it from your paycheck .
You said you were going to give me a discount !
Then ... 50,000 won .
I went through it again , but there was no dog recorded .
Vice President was mistaken .
He was bit by the burglar ...
You 're sure there is no dog , right ?
There is none .
Tae Gong Shil !
What are you doing ?
About what ?
I heard Yi Ryeong got hurt .
No ... she was startled , but she didn 't get hurt .
But ...
Tae Gong Shil , what did you see ?
Huh ?
I saw you talking with CEO Joo .
Didn 't you say that you saw a dog ?
No one saw the dog , and it wasn 't even recorded on surveillance .
What is it that only you saw ?
About that , actually ...
Ghosts ... spirits ...
I hate people going around saying they saw those things . They 're pathetic . I hate them .
Did you really see a dog ?
I didn 't see it .
How could I have seen something that no one else saw ?
Then why did you tell CEO Joo that you saw a dog ? What was that about ?
Um ...
Mr. CEO asked me to find someone ... and " gae ( dog , he / she ) " was here before ...
I wasn 't saying a barking dog " gae " , but " gae " , meaning " she / he " , was here .
I think you were mistaken .
Let 's just say I was mistaken .
But ... what were you hiding just now ?
Was I mistaken again ?
How are you going to explain this time ?
It broke .
I 'm sorry .
You were being honest when you gave this to me .
But me ... I 'm sorry .
He was hiding in Tae Gong Shil 's office , but he wasn 't targeting CEO Joo .
Okay , I 'll keep an eye out .
Sweet love ?
I 'm sorry .
No .
I 'm the one who 's sorry , Kang Woo .
I 'm sorry I screamed and got mad at you when you talked about ghosts .
No , no , I 'm sorry .
I didn 't realize how much you hated ghosts ...
I 'm really sorry I talked about ghosts .
It 's not that I hate ghosts ... I 'm afraid .
Are you that afraid of ghosts ?
When I was in the army , I saw a lot of horrible deaths .
I even got counseling at one point because of nightmares .
Is that so ...
So ... when someone says those things are around , it 's hard to handle .
There are none .
There is nothing around you .
Not a single thing .
Trust me .
I 'm certain .
I 'll trust you .
Oh . Don 't put any meaning to the candy breaking .
You 're supposed to break candies anyways .
Let 's eat it now , since it 's broken already .
Shall we ?
We should take a half each since it 's broken like that anyways .
It 's sweet .
You can feel it . You 're ...
Pil Seung ?

Why do I see a dancing dog ghost ?
What ?
Is this a dream ?
I dreamed a dog ( bad ) dream .
Is it because of this ?
I 'm going to forget about Pil Seung now .
I can live like a normal person , but if I act like I don 't see it , they 'll still bother me .
I don 't care how you live , but that dog came out in my dream .
Isn 't it just a dog ( bad ) dream that everyone dreams of ?
Nobody .
♫ I want nobody , nobody but you ♪
Look at him !
Pil Seung is dancing and also wagging his tail !
He 's liking it !
Right .
That dog came out in my dream .
I don 't ever want to dream about a dancing dog .
Take this and return it to its owner , and send ... the dog .
You were holding me back from going saying it 's dangerous .
I 'm going to pretend like I didn 't see it .
I don 't want to see it .
Follow the dog .
I 'll ... go ... with you .
You 're friendly with the dog .
They 're tickets to a musical .
It 's a VVIP seat that a salaryman 's paycheque can never get .
It 's a reward for yesterday 's incident .
It 's today .
It starts at 9 , so it we 'll be in time if we meet up at 8, have dinner , and a cup of tea .
Okay .
Hey .
We have to decide where we meet .
Why do I have to decide that with you ?
It 's a reward !
Not the ticket , but I am .
Are you going to ask for it back if I decline you ?
I 'm showing you my sincerety since it seems rude to just end it with a material .
It 's fine .
I 'll go with the person I want to go with .
Thank you .
Okay ... have ... fun .
That dung manner .
Let 's go , Pil Seung .
So why did you appear in that dream ?
What did ?
What appeared in a dream ?
A movie ...
I watched a movie ... and the scene kept appearing in my dreams .
Do you like movies ?
Then do you like musicals , too ?
We 're off early today .
Let 's go together .
Okay .
But I can 't stay in the dark for so long ... like ... I might scream and run out of the theatre .
It 's not a horror musical .
And if you get scared , you can hold on .
Let 's go .
I 'll go .
It starts at 9 , so let 's meet in front of the theatre at 8 .
Let 's go .
It 's hot , and we can 't even drive .
Why do I have to follow a dog that I don 't see ?
You said you 're scared of it appearing in your dreams again !
Should we just forget about it ?
Go .
Pil Seung is going that way !
Where are you going ?
Do I see it ?
I don 't see it .
How dare you nag me ?
Hurry up !
I have an appointment at 8 !
I have to dress up !
You said you 're watching a musical with sweet Candy Kang , right ?
Are you even able to watch it until the end ?
How would you know what 's sitting beside you ?
I 'm going to sit beside him even if I have to close my eyes .
So let 's hurry up , it 's that way .
I don 't know !
It 's too hot !
I have to drink something cold .
CEO !
Let 's hurry up and eat .
I want Patbingsu !
What about you ?
I don 't see those things .
Two long blacks .
Wait !
I don 't want to drink that though ...
I only drink the one I have decided on .
I don 't like seeing other people eat something that looks better than mine .
Then you can also ...
- Get it off !
I don 't look at menus .
Long black , please ...
CEO .
Has Hee Joo ever appeared in your dreams ?
Like Pil Seung , it would be good if Hee Joo appeared in your dreams and told you something .
That never happened .
After that time , I don 't see Hee Joo anymore .
A ghost appears when someone talks , or thinks about them .
Talk about Hee Joo to me .
I 'll listen .
I don 't have anything to say to you .
Do you not trust me ?
Are you worried that I 'll run off with your money ?
Yeah .
I don 't trust you .
A person creates their weaknesses when they talk about themselves .
I don 't want you to know any of mine .
You don 't trust me ...
The dog 's going , shall we follow him ?
Let 's go .
But CEO ...
The fact that you 're coming with me even though you don 't see it ... That 's called trust .
It 's that way , let 's go .
Ah yes . This is an identification tag of a military dog ?
Then , please look into a military dog named Pil Seung right away .
He must be here .
If we find who it is , we talk about the dog , and return this .
Don 't provoke him by lecturing .
We 're not the police .
But it 's scary to meet someone who stole something ...
Why ?
The dog 's giving me its hand like this .
It must mean that everything 's alright .
Look at him taking the side of his owner .
I think it 's over there .
Yes , Secretary Kim .
The dog collar that you have is an identification tag of a military dog that has recently been euthanized .
A military dog ?
Pil Seung , you were a military dog ?
And also ... the soldier responsible for the military dog has apparently deserted the military and is armed .
I think the one that came into Kingdom yesterday was the deserter .
Pil Seung ...
I 'm going to follow you from here . A soldier must have at least one favorite girl group .
Nobody , nobody , but you . ♫ nobody , nobody , but you ♫
I want nobody , nobody , but you . ♫ I want nobody , nobody , but you . ♫
I hate love .
I hate anyone but you .
Nobody , nobody , nobody nobody ♫ Nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody . I want nobody
Are you not going to straighten up ?
Are you a fool ?
You can 't even do it correctly , you loser ?
My vacation time was taken because of you !
Why do I have to go through all this trouble because of you !
Go away !
You ...
Run in full combat gear until I say stop , alright ?
! Answer me !
- Yes !
Pil Seung .
If you weren 't here , I probably couldn 't have decided to hang in there until discharge .
Are you saying , " It 's okay .
Don 't worry " ?
You 're all I have .
Nobody , nobody , but you .
You 're the only one I have ...
Pil Seung can no longer function as a military dog .
We 've decided to euthanize it .
If you let it live , I 'll take care of it until I get discharged .
Can 't you do something ?
Please spare him .
You 'll be the one performing the euthanasia .
Hey , Kim Hyeong Cheol . You 're seriously out of your mind , aren 't you ?
Can 't you do it correctly ?
Aren 't you going to get up quickly ?
Look down .
What are you going to do by staring ?
Woah . Woah . Hey !
Pil Seung .
I 'm so scared .
I think it came to ask me to stop him from doing dangerous things .
Secretary Kim reported to the police and military that Corporal Kim is here .
The fact that he has a gun means we shouldn 't follow him any further .
Come out .
They 'll be here any minute .
Shouldn 't we persuade him before they get here ?
You . I think you don 't get it because all you see every day are dead people .
But he has a gun !
A gun ! If we intervene at the wrong time , we could get killed .
Pil Seung is crying .
It 's crying .
That person must be crying , too .
Tae Gong Shil .
You said , even if you see them , you can decide to ignore them .
I was going to do that , but I can 't do it well .
You can NOT see them .
Hold it .
You ... said you had a date at 8 o 'clock , didn 't you ?
Right now , go home , and neatly wash your hair , get dressed properly and put on a make-up , too .
Get there on time as a normal woman .
You always ask me to hold you so you can do that .
I 'll hold you , so hold me .
Let 's go .
I guess I 'm just a hopelessly crazy girl .
I 'll be right back .
Tae Gong Shil !
Why do you not listen ?
! Tae Gong Shil !
It 's a gun !
No , no .
There 's someone who has a gun !
Run !
Hurry and run !
Tae Gong Shil ?
Tae Gong Shil ?
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Go- -
- Don 't come any closer !
I have no intention of getting close .
You ... I know you have no intention of shooting me .
If you did , change it to having no such intention .
You have to realize that you have no intention to shoot .
Yes .
Now put the gun down .
Better if you throw it to the side .
I had no intention of harming anyone .
Leave .
Hey , deserter .
How about you come with me ?
I 'm going to end it here .
Get out .
You know Pil Seung , right ?
How do you know Pil Seung ?
That 's ...
This is really Pil Seung 's !
That 's right .
Pil Seung is beside you right now .
What are you talking about ?
Pil Seung is ...
I know .
He 's a dead dog .
I see that dead dog .
Pil Seung 's beside me ?
Yeah .
It 's a very handsome and smart German Shepherd .
Is it your taste of liking Nobody ?
I played it for him everyday .
Because we 're fans of Wonder Girls .
That friend was by your side all this time .
He wants to protect you so you won 't do anything dangerous .
Pil Seung died because I was an idiot ... and he protected such a person like me ?
That dog is ... giving you a hand like this .
Are you telling me that everything 's alright ?
I don 't have anyone but you !
Pil Seung ... are you telling me that everything 's alright ?
Corporal Kim has disarmed himself and surrendered .
No civilians were hurt , and the incident was resolved .
Anyways , I will send a situation report to the police since he was also hiding in Kingdom .
It 's a relief that there were no damages .
He apparently was a soldier taking care of military dogs .
Does that mean the dog was with him ?
I don 't know about that , but I 'm just relieved that everyone seems unharmed .
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody Thanks .
I 'm sorry for alarming you two .
We 're alright .
But what brings you , Mr. CEO , all the way here for ?
We were supposed to see you for entering the Kingdom .
I came here to buy some couches .
I see you are satisfied with what we set up for you at your home .
There are still cameras outside , right ?
We 're just going sit here until they are all gone .
Alright .
If you two are looking for beds as well , it 's that way .
It 's fine .
You may go now .
Alright .
CEO , you were really good at it .
It looked as if you actually see it .
I 've seen you do it a couple of times .
But are you going to keep the promise you made with the soldier ?
Wait .
It 's going to be hard getting back up from a slanted life with only a dog ghost 's comfort .
I 'm Kingdom 's CEO .
If you come back without any trouble , I 'll give you a job .
Don 't forget about Pil Seung .
That dog ghost is very smart .
He didn 't only drag you into this , but also dragged me in and gave him a path for the future .
I 'm very glad that I didn 't ignore it .
You .
Next time when I tell you to leave , you immediately get lost .
And when I tell you , " Don 't go " , don 't ever go .
Yes .
It 's too cramped , go over there .
CEO , read this .
What is it ? It 's a confirmation document to confirm that you were not hurt , and you are not planning to sue the store in the future after today 's incident .
I don 't mind , but you 're strict with these kind of things .
You can read it over and sign it .
It 's a tissue that wipes their mouth after scaring me .
Read it .
I already read it .
You can read it and sign it .
Do you know how much my signatures cost ?
I can 't do it thoughtlessly .
You read every single line .
It 's not like you don 't know how to read ... read it by yourself .
Forget it .
I can tell Secretary Kim to do it .
CEO ... can you not read words ?
It 's that I don 't read . I can 't read words .
It somehow just happened that way .
Why ?
Did you find a weakness ?
After that incident , it somehow became this way .
When I was being locked , they made me read books .
By a psycho ...
The book that I had to read was about people continuously being killed .
I wondered , " Who would be killed next ? " as I read through every single line .
And then wondered , " Who would be killed next ? " again .
Then I felt like when everyone is dead after the book is finished , it would be me that would be killed last .
Anyways , I lived .
However , after that , every time I see words , I feel like throwing up .
I 'm scared of reading words .
What can we do ?
How should we solve this ?
What do you mean " How " ?
Why are you so worried when you can 't do anything ?
That 's what I mean . It would still be a help if I can say , " If you 're scared , hold onto me " .
Do you want to hold onto me just in case ?
I don 't need it .
Then ...
I 'll help you read from now on .
I don 't need that either .
Secretary Kim does that .
Secretary Kim 's recording was what you were always plugged into .
I 'll read this for you .
Con.fir.ma.tion !
It 's that I don 't read . It 's not that I don 't hear .
Okay .
Confirmation .
The incident that has happened in the following store ...
Are you reading a picture book to kindergarteners ?
Confirmation .
The incident that has ...
Too fast .
Confirmation ...
Too low .
Do . Re . Mi .
Pitch it on " Mi " .
Confirmation .
You can 't sing , right ?
I 'll do it !
Confirmation .
What ?
Nobody took that doll yet .
They must have thrown it out .
Let 's keep it .
Hi !
You 're our friend now !
Play with us !
Am I too early ?
Why did you buy another ticket ?
I wanted to see it . Who he comes to see it with .
Musical SENSE 2013
Wait here for a minute .
International call
Yes .
I 'm out right now due to a personal appointment .
It 's unrelated to CEO Joo Joong Won .
Joo Joong Won ?
I will continue keeping an eye and report you about
CEO Joo Joong Won 's personal affairs .
But ...
I 'll stop reporting you about Tae Gong Shil 's affairs .
It 's uncomfortable for me that I have to lie to her .
Please understand .
Yes .
Do you spy on CEO Joo Joong Won ?
What are you lying to Tae Gong Shil about ?
Yes , Secretary Kim .
Come now please .
It would be good if you can hold onto me and read words , like how I don 't see scary ghosts when I hold onto you .
Take a chance and try holding it once .
Are you listening to my heart
Are you seeing my tears
The only one in this world
The only one
That must be you for me
You make me crazy
You make me cry
Preview
From here to here is Tae Gong Shil zone .
In Tae Gong Shil zone , there won 't be any more conversations after " but " .
Are you making a scene right now ?
Get lost .
Kang Woo !
Go date the sweet Candy Kang .
Back and forth , back and forth !
Rock , paper , scissors !
Let 's be friends !
Rock , paper , scissors !
Take us with you .
There are weird kids ...
Get out of my house !
You don 't know how scared I was .
I 'm scared of you .
I don 't want to be invovled with you .
Cha Hee Joo ...
I don 't think it should continue any further .
Tae Gong Shil , you 're over .
Wake up .
The car is on the way .
Sleeping next to you , Mr. CEO , was so sweet . I slept well .
You drooled here while you slept .
You can buy this .
I could just wipe it off .
I slept well .
It would be great if I could sleep a little more .
Feel free to do that , but I thought you had a date .
My date !
You 're right !
Kang Woo !
Customer ...
Here you go .
Episode 7
Mr. CEO !
He said this is the copy of the agreement you signed . He said we should divide it up and each take a copy .
Also , he gave this .
He said we should each take one , as a pair .
It 's a souvenir gift that the furniture store hands out to its customers .
Let 's divide it up and take one each .
Why do I have to divide this with you ?
I don 't want to become involved with you as a " pair . "
It 's very cool .
Put it away .
Yes , alright .
Why haven 't you left ?
Why are you still standing here ?
Aren 't you going to give me a ride ?
I 'm too tired today .
I almost got shot , while being involved with you .
I 'm sorry , Mr. CEO .
I think it 's dangerous for me to get dragged into the world you see .
I shouldn 't go any further .
There needs to be a firm line between you and me .
Are you saying you 'll draw a line and tell me to get lost ?
Let 's just keep focused on each other 's uses .
From now on , from here to there is Tae Gong Shil 's " zone . "
If you need a safety hideout , instead of talking to me , just touch me here , and leave .
Talk to me only when you see something that is useful to me , like Cha Hee Joo .
To me , talking to you about random things made me feel better .
I don 't like it , so stick to the rules .
I 'll give you the Tae Gong Shil Zone . However , don 't try to touch other places .
There are no eyes , ears , or mouth on this arm . So don 't expect me to see , hear , or talk .
Mr. CEO , I talked to you because you 're not scared of ghosts .
That 's right .
I 'm not scared of ghosts .
I 'm afraid of you , Tae Gong Shil .
Is Taeyang not coming with us ?
She says she has a date .
Let 's go .
Yes .
Well , he did almost get shot because of me . It 's understandable that he thinks I 'm dangerous .
Tae Gong Shil !
Oh it 's you , Yi Ryeong .
Hi .
Did you come to see a musical ?
Yep .
You , too ?
I 'm leaving , but I just saw something very interesting .
Ok ...
Well , bye then .
You know ... I thought you were going to pretend that you didn 't see me .
Thanks for saying hi - it was so good to see you .
Bye , small Taeyang ( sun ) .
Ok ... good luck , big Taeyang ( sun ) .
I guess big Taeyang has no grasp of what 's going on .
Per my client 's orders , I am keeping a close eye on people approaching CEO Joo .
Tae Gong Shil is one of them .
So you 've been friendly with her because you want to investigate her ?
I 'm doing this to protect CEO Joo .
From now on , don 't interfere and interrupt my job .
I won 't interrupt .
You said you were watching the musical with Gong Shil , right ?
Do your job well .
I guess she came here thinking it was a date .
Too bad , big Taeyang .
Kang Woo !
Are you angry that I 'm late ?
I think it just started ... should we go in ?
Let 's ... not watch this .
Why ?
I heard it 's not funny .
I heard it is funny ...
People say it 's not funny .
Right now , I don 't want to see people acting about something that isn 't real .
Let 's do something else .
Honestly , I didn 't want to be in a dark place , either .
Then , what should we do ?
Let 's do what you want to do .
I 'll follow you without asking any questions .
You signed this ?
Did you check the details ?
Yes .
Tae Gong Shil read it for me .
Did you tell her about your dyslexia ? ( Did you tell her that you couldn 't read ? )
Yes .
I am not going to be dragged along by Tae Gong Shil anymore .
After almost getting shot , I gave her a warning .
You must have been so shocked .
Will a single anti-anxiety pill be good enough ?
This will be enough .
Tae Gong Shil also has a copy , so if you think there will be a problem , call her immediately .
I 'll do it tomorrow .
You said she was on a date ...
I can 't call her and ruin it .
That muscial ... we were going to invite it to the Kingdom 's fall cultural event .
I guess it 's a fun show .
There 's no way she can properly sit and watch .
She 's either going to run out screaming something jumped out at her , or chase after something she finds pitiful .
It 's going to be one of those .
You 're wrong .
If she had a problem , you would have received a call .
Seeing how it 's quiet , the date is going well .
Tae Yang is being too selfish ...
Going on a date when Master is here in shock and taking an anti-anxiety pill !
Well , I guess she can 't skip her date even if she begins to worry about you .
Have some rest .
Is there something wrong ?
I guess you catch colds in the summer if you 're old .
I 'll set an appointment with the doctor , so go straight to the hospital .
Secretary Kim , you can never be sick .
Of course , I can 't get sick until I find someone to replace me .
Ugh ... it 's bitter .
Now that I have taken an anti-anxiety pill ... I need to sleep .
While someone is having a hard time sleeping even after taking a bitter anti-anxiety pill ... I guess someone is fine and enjoying a sweet time .
I came here because you didn 't have a particular place you wanted to go .
Is this place okay ?
Oh , it 's the Han river .
It 's my first time here ... since the incident when I was here eating chicken with my sister and almost got dragged into the water .
Did you almost drown in the water ?
Yes .
Kang Woo , let 's not get too close to the water .
Then , do you want to go over there , to the fountain show ?
Yes , let 's go .
Oh my !
Aren 't you going ?
Kang Woo , let 's go that way .
The bridge is that way ...
In that direction , there is a bicycle rent shop .
Do you want to ride a bike ?
Yes .
Let 's go that way .
Is the breeze cool ?
Yes .
[ No , leave . ]
Kang Woo , can 't you go faster ?
Hurry , Kang Woo .
It was fun riding on a bicycle because it has been a while since I last rode it .
Should we come back here later to ride it again ?
I told you I don 't like it .
Why do you keep on asking that ?
If you don 't like it , never mind .
Kang Woo , that 's not it .
I just don 't like being hot .
It is very hot .
Do you want to drink some water ?
Yes .
They sell drinks over there .
Please buy it for me .
Wait for me .
Sir , would racing once be enough ?
Excuse me .
Excuse me .
Hello .
I am sorry , but can you help me just this once ?
Please hold this ...
Stand right over there .
Sir , hold that here .
Here .
Yes .
I am sorry but please just help me this once .
What ?
Over there , there . Ready ! Ready , set , and ...
Bang !
Fighting !
Fighting !
Ajusshi !
Ajusshi !
Please leave now .
Bye .
I am sorry .
Are you okay ?
Thank you .
I am sorry .
They said that there was a crazy girl around here .
It must be her .
Babe , you should be careful too .
You never know what you will turn into .
Kang Woo !
You should have waited .
Why did you come ?
Because I feel sorry .
Then , shall we drink this while we 're at the water show ?
Let 's go .
I really hate water ghosts !
Please. don 't come out .
Please !
Please , don 't come out .
The water ghost was way too scary .
He wouldn 't have followed me , right ?
Would he ?
That 's right .
I am not afraid of ghosts .
I am afraid of you , Tae Gong Sil .
He 's probably afraid of being bothered with ghostly incidents because of me .
Hello , Mr. CEO .
I was just debating whether to call you or not just in case some ghost followed me .
Drop that .
I only called for a business matter .
I 'm thinking of inviting that musical team you watched today to the Autumn Festival .
Report how good they were .
I couldn 't watch that today .
You couldn 't watch it ?
We just went to the Han River to get fresh air .
Oh yeah ?
But a running ghost kept chasing me .
It was hard to pretend to look normal .
I knew it would have happened .
And also , we went to see the water show .
A water ghost kept jumping in and out of the water .
You have no idea how scared I was .
So I thought of calling you just in case that ghost followed me here .
But you called me right on time .
I am very grateful .
I didn 't call to make you grateful .
And also , I told you not to say things like that to me , didn 't I ?
Okay , if you didn 't see the musical . Get lost ... No ,
Tae Gong Shil will also need that bitter medicine .
I 'm sleepy .
I only got to communicate with the hide-out , and I feel much less scared .
There is " Tae Gong Shil Zone . " I 'm not allowed to touch anywhere else .
But that zone is too small , isn 't it ?
Rock Paper Scissor !
Rock , paper , scissor !
Mom , you will be late again today ?
Rock , paper , scissor !
Seung Joon is sick .
Yes .
Seung Joon , where are you sick ?
You really aren 't going to eat rice ?
I will go out and buy the bread you like .
Rock , paper , scissor !
Rock , paper , scissor !
Rock , paper , scissor !
Rock , paper , scissor !
Rock , paper , scissor !
Noona !
Noona !
Is that you , Seung Mo ?
Seung Joon seems strange ?
Seung Joon !
Are you sick ?
- Noona , I 'll go get mom .
- Okay .
Why are you so cold ?
Do you have indigestion ?
I 'll go get some medicine .
Your mom doesn 't come even if you get sick , right ?
You really might become a friend of ours .
We have digestive medicine somewhere here .
Oh my , Seung Joon .
What should I do ?
It looks like Seung Joon 's mom is here .
My baby ...
Oh my baby , were you sick ?
Mommy 's sorry .
Yes , mommy 's sorry .
Let 's go to the hospital .
It 's okay , we just have to go to the hospital now .
I guess he won 't do .
His mom hugged him .
He can 't be our friend .
You guys are the one !
You are the ones that bothered Seung Joon , right ?
Hide !
Where did they go ?
They came here .
Where are you guys ?
You are going to bother Seung Joon here again , huh ?
Come out !
Did you guys hide in here ?
Mr. CEO !
I discovered this .
What is this ?
There are weird kids in here .
But ...
No , it 's not because I am scared of this .
Then leave .
But , Mr.CEO -
Inside the Tae Gong Shil zone , no conversation continues after " but . " Away you go .
Vanish !
Tae Gong Shil , what are you doing ?
Why are you putting it here ?
This is a bit dangerous , so I was going to leave it here for a while ...
Why would you leave something dangerous here ?
To put me in danger ?
You aren 't scared of things like this at all .
There are three children ghosts in here .
Tae Gong Shil , I almost got shot yesterday .
At a time like this , you should bring vitamins and say
'Mr . CEO , I slept well yesturday
Before you sleep , you should have taken anti-anxiety pills ' or if not you can 't bring three ghosts here
I can do that ?
Am I allowed to worry about you ?
I thought you hated me worrying about you , so I didn 't say those things .
Am I allowed to ?
Yes , tell me .
Since my ears have holes , I have no other choice but to listen .
Mr. CEO ... did you have a good sleep ?
You were surprised a lot yesterday , right ?
I carry this with me because this is effective after I see scary ghosts .
Please take this , Mr. CEO .
Is this approved by the Food and Drugs Administration ?
I bought it from a pharmacy .
I will share it with you from now on .
From now on , forever , are you telling me to be shocked together with you ?
While I used to be scared alone , now that I have you next to me , I don 't think I need this medication as much .
Also , this dangerous doll ... please keep an eye on it , since you are the most " safe " person at Kingdom .
You say it 's dangerous ...
Scary and dangerous things are supposed to be guarded by the security team .
Shouldn 't you give it to Kang Candy ?
I can 't do that to him .
He really hates these things .
What if it scares him too much ?
If he gets scared , feed him this and , with that ... Get lost .
He designated a " Tae Gong Shil Zone " on you ?
Yes , but it 's too small .
It will get bigger .
This is what you asked me for .
Yes .
So this is what the CEO was looking for so much ...
It does look like it 's worth 10 billion won .
That 's Cha Hee Joo .
She was even prettier when she was alive .
She 's pretty .
What is this .
She left it here .
When things are sweet for Tae Gong Shil , why do I feel bitter ?
Ah , it 's bitter !
Too bitter !
I have to look for someone other than you guys .
Don 't make me waste time and come out quickly .
You guys are bad kids bothering good kids , right ?
Tell me why you 're doing bad deeds .
You 're not going to talk ?
Come out .
Come out !
Come out , come out .
I told you to come out !
Come out already !
Tae Gong Shil ?
What are you doing with that doll ?
You can 't be actually talking with a doll , can you ?
I know everything .
I 've seen you do it a few times .
You saw everything ?
You , Tae Gong Shil , have even talked to a trashcan , and conversed with pictures on the walls .
You saw all of that ?
There was someone like that in my high school .
He even named his pencil and talked to it .
Do you ... know where he is now ?
A mental ... hospital ?
He works for NASA .
He used to say he would make spaceships to get to Andromeda .
He is really making it .
I guess you are really imaginative like him .
That 's right .
Imaginative ...
Drink some coffee .
Coffee , coffee , you look quite dark . Hello .
Have a nice conversation , and if black coffee doesn 't suit you , please add some cream .
Thank you .
Andromeda ...
A man I met at a hospital once told me that he met an alien there .
Don 't tell Kang Woo that you 've been going in and out of the hospital and the police station .
Although I can 't tell him about ghosts because it will bother him , shouldn 't I tell him about other things ?
I was so thankful and happy when someone told me they liked me , but I feel bad to deceive someone like this .
Gong Shil , you told me that you are doing much better these days .
Do things like that still appear ?
They don 't just not appear ...
What doesn 't ?
!
Lee Han Cheol !
What are you doing ?
! Why is Tae Gong Shil always like that ?
I told you not to scare Gong Shil like a ghost .
Am I a ghost ?
- This is a nosebleed , isn 't it ?
- No .
But I ... I think I just got a nosebleed .
Didn 't I get a nosebleed from Tae Gong Shil hitting me ?
This is assault .
Absolutely crazy .
I 'm telling you that 's not it ... Snot came out , snot .
Blow hard ! But it doesn 't feel like snot .
Aigoo ...
I can 't watch you get arrested for assault .
I was so shocked for no reason .
Why aren 't you going to her ?
Even to you , me going over there and ... asking " what happened ? " has that become something that is expected of me ?
Didn 't you always go when Tae Yang was like that ?
Always going , going too much ,
I won 't go anymore .
This year 's summer event -
Sorry .
They 're very favorable- -
If you are not feeling well , go to the hospital again .
No , it 's nothing , I have documents and articles I must show you today .
Secretary Kim , are you okay ?
Master Joo , can 't you call someone to take over for me just for today ?
Who ?
I have experience as a secretary .
But back then , the ghost next to the President with an ax sticking out of his head , kept appearing , so I quit ...
An axe ?
Did you work in a gangster 's office ?
No , it was a small but normal finance company .
What 's the name of the company ?
Sera Finance .
Last year , the president there was arrested for instigating murder .
Really ?
While you see ghosts , do you not watch the news ?
The stuff in the news and papers are supposed to be all true ... but after seeing ghosts I found out that not all of it is true .
Earlier this year , there was an artist who appeared in the newspaper for winning a global award .
But it turns out that artist stole his dead friend 's painting .
That artist is ...
Don 't tell me .
Know it for yourself and get away .
I just ... want to know that there is an artist in Korea who is good enough to win a big award and end it at that .
True or not , just read the newspaper you have .
Okay , I don 't know if it 's true , but Kingdom 's children 's summer event is receiving a big response from consumers .
That 's true .
Good . Keep reading .
Tae Gong Shil is taking Secretary Kim 's spot right now .
Really ?
That girl will eventually become CEO Joo 's weakness .
If the aunt disapproves , won 't the father disapprove as well ?
The person that the CEO hates the most is probably his father .
I don 't know if it 's the truth or not , but there were rumors that the reason that girl died was because of the CEO 's father .
At that time , there were rumors that because my brother didn 't pay the ransom , the girl named Hee Joo died .
Although it is a ridiculous story .
Of course , it is .
What father wouldn 't pay the ransom if he knew that his son could get killed ?
I hope Joo Won thinks that way .
For me , my brother going overseas is to find the lost jewelry and fix any misunderstandings .
We 'll see if my guess is right or wrong .
Why are you keep watching on your son ?
It seems like he would have seen the culprit of the incident . But he 's insisting he didn 't see .
Whether that 's true or not , I don 't know .
Are you afraid that the criminal would do something to your son ?
While Secretary Kim is sick and left his position open ,
Tae Gong Shil is sticking to him instead .
I told you they have that kind of relationship .
Don 't go around recklessly spreading things you don 't know the truth about .
Chief , please escape the dark-circled Tae Yang , who is more riddling than the mystery circle .
Poor you .
Ah !
During the executive meeting , be sure to listen well and organize information .
Do you want me to read the documents that were organized earlier ?
It 's fine .
I memorized it all .
If I don 't want to read it , I need to really concentrate and fill it up .
Since I 've been following you all day , I realize that you are quite busy .
Even while saying " CEO , " " CEO , "
you hardly recognize that I 'm the CEO of this place .
I thought you were idle because you always looked through the telescope in the office .
You have lots of work .
What are you always looking at through that ?
You always talked about the world you see .
Are you only now curious about the world I see ?
Take a look .
Start it .
From now , I will introduce the business plan for Kingdom in Shanghai .
To describe the current situations of domestic shopping malls that have branched out to Shanghai , there are a total of 7 businesses currently operating in Shanghai .
Most of them are congregated in the Taipan area , and as you can see in the reports , two businesses have already succeeded in settling and they 're considering expanding the business .
The rest of the businesses are in the phase of developing the business plan , just like us , and they 're researching the marketability ...
Go on please .
Ah , yes .
Currently , the rest businesses are researching the marketability in that area .
Currently , the marketplaces ' market share is ... Thanks for what you did earlier , Mr. CEO .
That 's because we agreed to do what 's needed for each other .
My head hurts from memorizing all that like crazy .
As for the meeting , I 'll organize the contents and give it to Secretary Kim when he 's here .
Can I see through that just once ?
If you look this way , it 's my competitor .
If you look that way , it 's a car entering Kingdom .
And this way , it 's a car exiting ( Kingdom ) .
I can see everything .
What I control and belong to is Kingdom .
I 'm already busy trying to make it more perfect .
Why ?
Did you see something again ?
I just remembered the long-haired ghost whom I saw earlier at the conference room .
I was about to scream , but , thanks to you , the meeting ended well .
Tae Gong Shil , it must have ended well for you . Since the hideout came when you caught something on the radar .
You . There 's another thing you thoroughly ignore other than the fact that I 'm the CEO .
I don 't ignore you , though .
No , you are .
The fact that your safety hideout is a man ... You 're thoroughly ignoring that .
That 's ...
If you think the safety hideout is a man , you can 't barge in asking to sleep together just holding hands , so ... You must think I 'm a concrete or something .
Anyway , the conference room earlier wasn 't quiet at all , and ever since you came , my world has been continuously noisy .
I just barged in to survive , but I didn 't realize I was complicating your situation .
Well , as for that part , I already decided to live with it when I stationed you . So I 'll take care of that on my own .
It 's time for the Kids Mall event .
Let 's go .
Think of him as concrete . Concrete .
Mr. CEO !
I would still feel very sorry about calling you just concrete .
You 're marble of the best quality .
Are you calling that a compliment ?
I 'm saying I treasure you that much .
Marble .
This isn 't just regular marble .
It 's the world 's most expensive marble .
Something you could never have if you were just a regular woman .
I had it available to you because of your special radar .
Just one span .
He keeps emphasizing it .
Just one span .
You 're working , aren 't you ?
Keeping surveillance .
I 'm not keeping surveillance , but I 'm being jealous .
Hmm ?
Watching the girl I 'm interested in go out with another man is jealousy .
You said you lied to her that you like her .
I didn 't say it 's still the case .
But , why do you keep showing up in front of me ?
Are you monitoring me ?
Or ...
Or ... what ?
What ?
Do you think I 'm following you around because I like you ?
Why would I ?
I 'm a top star !
Top celebrity !
And you 're just a salaried man ...
If you 're a top star , isn 't it supposed to be hard to see you often ?
Since I get to see it too often , you look just like a neighborhood girl .
Where 's that neighborhood ?
If I was a neighborhood girl , is an ahjussi Won Bin and a grandma Go Doo Shim in that neighborhood ?
Miss Top Star Tae Yi Ryeong . You look prettier on TV than up close , so don 't come out so often .
Does that mean ...
I look so so in real life ?
Does that what it means ?
He 's confusing me somehow .
Is he saying I 'm pretty or not so much ?
As for Tae Gong Shil . Is he monitoring her or being jealous ?
My contact lenses float around when I use my brain .
Ah ...
You seem to like kids .
Do you know how many wallets open per one kid ?
Mom , dad , paternal grandparents , maternal grandparents , 6 at least .
And when you add the aunts and uncles to that , the consumption power gets very very very enormous .
In our study motel , there 's a kid who plays with a doll picked up on the street because he has only 1 wallet - his mom .
If that bothers you , why don 't you open up your wallet and buy a toy ?
I 'll buy it somewhere else .
Did she just curse ?
I can 't even throw away that doll . What to do ?
Mom ... The bag is missing .
I think I lost it .
Go find it .
Who are you ?
Hello ?
Let 's be friends .
Take us with you .
You 're the same as us .
Huh ?
It 's that doll .
A doll ?
The doll that kid with a yellow t-shirt is holding ... It 's the doll I brought , isn 't it ?
Why is he taking that ?
What should I do ?
The kids in there will harass him like they did to Seung Joon .
Walk fast .
You should be scolded at home for losing the bag .
His mother is a member of our department store , so I looked up the address .
But is that doll that important ?
Yes .
I have to find it .
I 'm off from work soon .
Let 's go and find it together afterwards .
This is an urgent matter , so I have to get it right now .
Weren 't you working for CEO Joo instead of Secretary Kim today ?
Is it okay for you to just leave for the doll ?
CEO understands what I do .
I 'll be leaving now .
He understands her action of leaving the work to find a doll ?
President Joo does ?
Because of that doll , a kid that lives in my house got sick .
Are you sure that it 's because of that doll ?
I am sure .
That kid who took it will be sick too .
This is Kingdom .
Did your child maybe take a doll from here ?
A doll ?
Why ?
I 'm not trying to blame you .
There is some problems with that doll , so I 'll be there to pick it up .
He didn 't take such a thing .
He lost his bag at Kingdom though .
Why don 't you find that for me instead ?
Well ...
Hold on , hello ?
He took it .
Why is she lying that he didn 't ?
Do you think that kid might be hiding the doll ?
Stop .
If it 's not going to harm Kingdom , stop it there .
I have the address .
Can you please go with me ?
Tae Gong Shil . I told you I would only allow this much for you .
Don 't think of dragging me around .
Do you think my mom is mad ?
What should I do ?
You .
Do you know what you did wrong ?
Mom , I 'm sorry .
You didn 't find the doll ? No ...
You said that the kid lost a bag , right ?
This is a lost item reported today .
Do you think this is his ?
It is .
So his name is Chang Min ...
Let 's go together after work .
I can buy a better doll for him .
I 'll see you later .
Thank you .
She will let me in if I tell her that I found the bag , right ?
There is a good artist that I 'm planning to buy some pieces from .
Do you also want to buy some ?
Who is it ?
Baek Hwang Sul , who won a prestigious world-wide award this year .
The artist who was on the newspaper for receiving a global award , actually stole his dead friend 's work .
Is it that person ?
The price will go up .
It 'd be better to buy them now .
If I didn 't know , I would 've never hesitated about this good investment .
Why ?
You aren 't going to buy ?
I will think about it a little more .
Even if that artist is Baek Hwang Sul , I 'm still going to buy it .
I 'm only checking because I feel uncomfortable .
Tae Gong Shil !
Where did she go ?
What is this ?
Is it that kid 's ?
Come out .
I know you aren 't bad kids .
Come out .
What about Chang Min ?
Where is Chang Min ?
Chang Min , let 's go to the hospital .
Are you okay ?
Can you walk ?
What are you ?
We have to take him to the hospital .
Why do you care ?
Leave him here and leave !
You 're the one who did this to him , huh ?
I was only punishing him for his wrongdoings .
You punish him by making a kid like that ?
Are you even his mom ?
Get out of my house !
He needs to go to the hospital !
Mind your own business !
He needs to go to the hospital !
Where are you going ?
President .
He needs to be taken to the hospital right away .
I know .
The person who was with the kids at the last moment wasn 't an adult . It was this doll .
Mom , I 'm sorry .
No one helped .
No one came for them .
No one was sad for them .
That 's why the kids who shared same pains gathered in this doll and became friends .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry that no one came for you .
There 's a pink Dooly ?
That 's Dooly 's girlfriend , Gong Shil .
Gong Shil ?
Really ?
They 're dinosaurs .
Dooly 's girlfriend 's name is Gong Shil .
Didn 't you know ?
No ...
It 's Gong Shil .
You two look good together .
And what I mean to you Where 's Gong Shil ?
Since Tae Gong Shil isn 't here , dinosaur Gong Shil can look after here .
Dooly will look after the security team .
The doll has been burnt , but will the boy be alright ?
We 're examining him from his head to toe .
You guys are the ones that brought Pyun Chang Min here , right ?
Yes .
There was a report for housebreaking , physical assault and kidnapping .
We need you two to come with us .
What ?
Secretary Kim , I heard you went back because you were sick .
Are you alright ?
Yes .
Joong Won 's in there , right ?
I came here to ask him to have dinner with us .
It 's kind of difficult to do that right now ...
What 's wrong ?
Did something happen to Joong Won ?
Mr. CEO .
Mr. CEO , are you there ?
Mr. CEO , you 're okay , right ?
Be quiet .
I 'm thinking about how far I 've come , and how far I 'll go in the future following you .
But Mr. CEO , don 't worry too much .
I 've been here a few times .
It 's not so bad .
The seolleongtang they order here tastes delicious .
Should I ask if you 're hungry ?
Tae Yang !
I 'm not hungry .
Please be quiet .
What is it now ?
Kingdom 's child psychologist that obligates to reporting child abuse has reported you for child abuse .
Child psychologist ?
Who is that ?
Me .
And the Kingdom lawyer claims that what our CEO and worker has done during the process of rescuing an abused child was not an intentional assault .
Kingdom lawyer ?
Me .
Your son will be in treatment while you are being investigated , then he will be sent to child protection institution .
Why do you care what I do to my child ?
! And someone can hit their child once a wh -
A mosquito was sucking on you .
It hurts .
You know what it feels like to " hurt " ?
Let 's go .
What did I do wrong ?
! Kingdom will pay for all the medical expenses and protection fees .
Please look closely into any more marks of abuse .
CEO Joo Joong Won is at the police station ?
Why ?
I don 't know .
But why would a person like CEO Joo be there ?
I 'm helping you out .
Do you want to go together ?
Hey !
Let 's go togeth -
Kingdom corporation attorney will solve it .
Let 's go .
What about me ?
Mr. CEO ! Are you not taking me ?
I didn 't want to tell you because you might get angry ... but there 's a lady beside me .
I 'm scared !
Mr. CEO !
I have something to take care of .
You should head first .
I 'm sorry , Mr. CEO .
I 'm really sorry .
You don 't have to be sorry .
You did well , Tae Gong Shil .
Thank you for telling me that I did well .
You 're hurt .
Oh this ... I think I got scratched while fighting that lady .
That son 's mom should really be punished .
She made her own child in that state , but now she made another person 's child look like this ?
Tae Yang , let 's go to the hospital .
Warmth spreads CEO Joo came to the police station because of Tae Gong Shil ?
Doesn 't get any closer Cha Hee Joo ...
Lonely love yes I love you like my destiny I don 't go to the hospital that often , so I always had to hold the pain in .
I 'm glad that I came to the hospital with you , Mr. CEO .
I 'm also glad that I got to take a tour around the detention cell thanks to Tae Gong Shil .
But why is heat rising inside of me ?
Is that so ?
Would you like to use this then ?
It 's the one you got as a pair .
Oh , right .
You said you don 't want to be related as a pair .
It 's cool though , right ?
Mr. CEO , it 's not Tae Gong Shil zone here .
It 's already a used body .
Just use it .
I didn 't do that because of a ghost .
I just got a headache because I think I hit my head too hard .
It 's okay , you don 't have to hold me .
Just use it as a prevention since your headache is going to worsen if you see anymore ghosts in that state .
I 'm giving you a reward for doing well today .
This is expensive .
I thought you 'd never let me lay a hand on you back in the cell ...
It kind of feels weird to hear you tell me to use it since I did well .
When an insane sun rose in my world , I was trying anything to get you out .
However , I realized that I was actually the one being dragged into your gloomy world .
I was struggling to stop and get out , but I realized in the cell today . I ... Already ...
You wanted to be beside me , right ?
Congratulations .
You succeeded .
Secretary Kim 's probably here by now .
Let 's go .
Mr. CEO .
I ... Get a weird thing on my radar .
So use it .
It must be you for me You don 't feel a thing when I touch you like this , right ? Right ?
Do you really think I 'm an air-raid shelter made out of marble ?
If you love me That can 't be true .
You 're like the wind that disappears when I get closer
Preview
You 've seen a water ghost , right ?
I 've seen !
There 's a lady over there !
Go catch it .
I can 't catch it !
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Gong Shil , where are you going ?
! You touch me too much .
Are you possessed ?
When you truly don 't like it ... Pain answers .
Where did you hear that ?
Kang Woo ?
Cha Hee Joo ...
Did you arrange this for me ?
My heart flutters ...
I don 't think you 're hurt because of me .
I feel happy ...
I don 't have to be sorry that much , right ?
What if I go closer ?
I have to be careful ...
I like it too much .
I was just going to get you a glass of water or something .
No , it 's okay .
I don 't need any .
I 've been on the lookout ... and I don 't see Cha Hee Joo anywhere near you .
I guess she went to the person that she needs to protect .
For the past 15 years ... It was her fear that I might find out who the kidnapper was ... that made her stop by once in awhile just to keep an eye on me .
Why didn 't you tell anyone else that Cha Hee Joo was part of the kidnapping ?
I would 've told others had she survived .
And I would 've done whatever I could to make sure that she was captured .
I would 've ... just hated her .
But ... she died right in front of my eyes .
When I thought about how she was used and abandoned by someone else ... there was a part of me that felt bad for her .
But then ... the other kidnapper that she was with ... is someone that she needs to protect ?
I 've finally realized how I was completely deceived by her .
Fifteen years ago , I didn 't come to my senses after being smacked in the head . Now after another slap to the face , I am completely smacked awake .
It must 've been so difficult for you .
You told me that it was okay for me to worry about you and to comfort you .
How difficult it must 've been . You couldn 't even tell the truth .
I know that covering up your scars only makes the pain that much worse .
The trauma from that experience still prohibits you from being able to read , too .
That bitch .
I promise to cuss her out for you .
If I ever see Hee Joo again , I 'm going to do it properly .
'You 're such an awful bitch ' .
My ten billion won radar . You 're more useful that I thought .
I 'm not worth the ten billion anymore .
I haven 't even been able to find anything about where your money is hidden .
I 'm sure that the necklace is in your kidnapper 's possession .
My ransom that they demanded ... are you sure that you paid it ?
You can believe whatever you want .
It 's possible that even that ... could 've been just another perfect crime .
If we can 't locate that lost necklace ... he told me that he won 't tell me anything in regards to Cha Hee Joo .
It sounds like he no longer wants to put his trust in me ?
I should 've moved a bit faster .
I 'm sorry .
I was planning on going back to Korea soon anyways .
I 'm sure that his story will change once he takes a look at this .
Then , I 'll take my leave from Kingdom Enterprises now .
No , don 't do that . I want you to stay there until I get back .
Now that President Joo knows , I don 't think I 'll be able to stay here .
No , I 'm the one who started all this .
If I know anything about my son , I don 't think that he 'll fire you .
I 'm sure that he 'll just ignore everything .
I 'm sure he thinks that I 'll just ignore it and leave Team Leader Kang alone .
My father is the type of person who 'll antagonize me even more and then run away if he sees me squirming in my seat .
But if I ignore it with just the right amount he 'll come to me on his own and say whatever it is that he has to say .
I 'm someone who believes that playing hard to get is important whether it 's with a woman or with your own son .
I have to stay in Spain until after I celebrate Maria 's birthday .
I 'll see you when I return , Kang Woo .
I invited my friends to my birthday party , and all of them are coming .
Will the friends that you went on this trip with be coming , too ?
Yes .
Then is it possible that at least one of them will remember this woman ?
Yes .
You just wait until I see you again .
I need you to explain everything to me .
He 's really struggling right now .
I 'm sure he didn 't want to hear those words .
If your father finds out where the necklace is ... what would happen to Ms. Tae ?
Then I wouldn 't ... have ... anymore use for her .
Things have been livelier around here since Ms. Tae appeared .
I guess things will quiet back down again .
Did President Joo Joong Won tell you about me ?
Yes .
I was investigating you to see if you had any involvement with Cha Hee Joo .
Is that why you kept asking me about my relationship with President Joo ?
I misunderstood that and thought that you were just being jealous .
- I 'm sorry .
- If that was the case ... it would 've been better if you had just been honest and asked me outright .
I would 've made it easier for everyone and just told you what was going on .
Kang Woo . I 'll tell you everything .
First , let 's go to that dark corner over there .
I think Team Leader Kang purposely approached Ms. Tae with an ulterior motive . But it doesn 't seem like Ms. Tae is angry about it .
Even though she doesn 't let too many things get to her ... I 'm sure that it 's still upsetting for her .
What is it that you 're looking for ?
You can 't see it with your eyes .
If I say the wrong thing ... everyone 's going to think that President Joo and I are both crazy .
So I 'm searching for just the right thing .
Kang Woo . I see things that others can 't see .
I can ... see ghosts .
When normal people feel a cool breeze of air , or a sudden chill ... I can see and hear what they are .
Tae Gong Shil . Are you just trying to frighten me by telling me these scary stories because you 're mad at me ?
I wasn 't going to say anything because I know how scared you are of them . But I can 't explain my relationship with President Joo unless I tell you about this .
In order for me to converse with the late Cha Hee Joo ... I 've been staying close to President Joo 's side all this time .
You see dead people ... and you talk to them ?
I think that grandmother just recently lost her beloved cat .
A pretty white cat is sitting beside her right now .
I don 't see any cats .
But I see it .
Grandmother . By any chance ... did you used to have a cat ?
Yes , I did . But ... my cat died recently .
My little cutie ... She was white as fresh fallen snow .
Since I have no use for her ... I should get her out of here .
Is she crying ?
She 's sleeping ?
I thought she was crying .
I guess she wasn 't that upset .
Is ... something here ?
Don 't awake her .
She needs sleep so that she can look out for ghosts and hear them out .
Just leave her alone when she 's sleeping .
This is the defense shield zone .
Where is it ?
Get lost !
I just ... I just wanted to create a space for you where you could breathe .
Well ...
I guess there is some use for her after all .
Pervert .
That was a good nap .
Have you been there long ?
Why didn 't you wake me up like you usually do ?
Okay .
That looks good .
Here .
Does he make you deliver too now ?
All the ghosts love me too much .
The scary lady that came to see me told me that I have this bright aura around me which draws all ghosts to me .
Hey !
What 's good about being popular amongst ghosts ?
I guess .
Even that lady told me to be careful .
Make sure to be careful so that you 're not swallowed up by them .
What does she mean ... swallowed up ?
It means that a dead person might want to use my body to come back to the living .
What is this ?
Did you follow me all the way here just because I said something to you ?
But it still doesn 't matter because I can 't see or hear you .
You don 't scare me one bit .
If a ghost wants to borrow my body to relay a message that they want ... do you think that I should let them borrow it ?
You must be completely out of your mind !
I normally don 't like to tell you that you 're crazy . But that 's just pure crazy talk , okay ?
Right ?
If I do that and they completely take over my body , then that means I 'll have to die .
I don 't want that .
Honey . It 's me .
Let me play the song that I practiced today for you .
I hope you like it .
It 's been a month now , right ?
I think that man believes that his wife will come back to life .
My concert is coming up soon .
I need you .
Come back to me .
There 's a lot of interest about this world renowned pianist , Ruijjang .
This cultural event is going to give our Kingdom more of a luxurious image .
I booked him .
I heard that he hasn 't moved his fingers since his wife 's death .
Have you met with him directly to verify that for yourself ?
It 's not Ruibang , it 's Ruijjang .
And he can move his fingers just fine .
I saw that for myself .
Since Joong Won is busy with the business deal with the Chinese I need you to work with Ruibang yourself .
I 'm going to get rid of Bang Shil while Joong Won is gone .
How many times have I told you that it 's not ' Bang ' .
I love you .
I calculated Tae Gong Shil 's usefulness to me .
Are you trying to get rid of your radar now ?
Why do you think that I 'm going to get rid of you ?
You told me that I 'd be worthless if I couldn 't find your money and you told me that you 'd kick me out once I become worthless .
Yes , I did .
So ... how much do you think that you 're worth ?
If I 'm to be generous about it and say that I 'm getting paid as much as what the customer representatives gets paid ... and if I deduct the defensive shield usage ... then I 'm sure that I 'll be in the negative .
You want to calculate your worth in money ?
So , you have learned a few things from me .
Then have you checked your bank account recently ? I 'm sure your paycheck must 've been deposited in there .
The deposited amount in your account is ...
President Joo !
I 've paid you according to the work you 've done .
You were instrumental in getting the chairman to invest in my company and I 've just paid you for the difference you made by taking care of the hotel problem .
Even after your usage of the defensive shield has been deducted there 's still quite a bit left , isn 't there ?
Your worth is still in the positive .
When you 're no longer in the positive , that 's when you 're out of here .
Thank you .
If I keep up at this rate ... I may be able to catch a few more ghosts , and even buy myself a house !
You . Were you planning to quietly go away if I had told you to get out of here ?
It doesn 't really hurt my feelings when you tell me to get lost every day .
So , I could 've just continued to stick by your side like I do now .
But if you had told me to get lost this time ...
If I had told you to get lost , I 'm sure you would 've just stuck to me again . Because I have to say it at least three times before you actually do go away .
You 're right .
But ... if you truly want me out of your life ... I 'll recognize that at once and get out of your life then .
So all this time ... you 've been ignoring what I said like you 'd ignore a barking dog ?
Get lost .
Thank you .
Chief Secretary Kim ! I 've hit the lottery today .
Have you known about this ?
President Joo is the one who got lucky all thanks to the work you 've done .
This is all thanks to you .
If anything ever bothers you in your sleep , all you have to do is tell me about it .
- I 'll help you out .
- Thank you .
Hello .
Why do you keep that tacky Tae Gong Shil around when you 're dating Tae Yi Ryung ?
It seems you must be mistaken about something .
Tae Yi Ryung is the just ' Little Sun ' , and Tae Gong Shil is the ' Big Sun ' .
Are you taking her side right now ?
If it bothers you that much feel free to call out whomever you want and set up a dinner date .
- I 'll come meet them for dinner .
- In that case ... When you go to China for your business trip , I want you to meet with Park Seo Hyun of Sejin Construction who is there studying abroad right now .
She 's the one that we were planning set you up with . But it fell though when she broke her leg at the ski lodge awhile back .
You remember , don 't you ?
Okay , I 'll meet her .
Will that make you feel better ?
That 's right .
The ' Big Sun ' won 't be rising in China , right ?
According to the weather reports , it 's supposed to storm during my trip .
Then , I guess we won 't be seeing any sun .
I heard that there 's going to be some strong rainfall over here , too .
Ahh , that 's hot .
Kang Woo . Are you struggling with something ?
The dead cat really was white .
I was up all night thinking about that ... and I wasn 't able to sleep a wink .
I 'm sorry .
I really wasn 't going to say anything because I didn 't want to scare you .
Is it in here too ?
Do you always have ... those things around you ?
Well ... a little ...
But ... they 're not always so scary .
They 're ghosts , but it doesn 't mean that they 're always dripping in blood with their hollowed out eye sockets . Those aren 't the only ones that are around .
That 's enough .
Okay , I understand .
Please don 't tell me anymore about it .
Okay , I won 't say anything else .
If it 's too difficult for you to handle , then ignore everything that I 've told you . Just think of me as living in my own little world and just ... ignore me and everything else that you 've learned .
How is it that President Joo Joong Won believes in what you say ?
Because President Joo is ... a very special person to me .
But if I ignored everything then I probably wouldn 't know what your world is like , right ?
Even though I can 't force you to believe me I have nothing to do with those culprits .
I just need to keep my eye out for Hee Joo .
I 'll keep my eye on you .
I 'll just consider my fear my punishment for lying to you ... and I 'll find a way to handle it .
When he 's that frightened ...
I can 't exactly just ask him to trust me .
What should I do ?
Hey , what 's wrong with you ?
It 's a human being .
No , I 'm not a human being . I 'm a goddess .
Hey , ' Salary Man ' .
Your face isn 't looking so good .
You were too excited to sleep all night because a goddess asked you to date her , right ?
Goddess is a form of ghost too , right ?
I really ... hate things like that .
Leave .
Well , if you 're that burdened by it ... then I 'll just be a regular human being instead of a goddess for you .
Aren 't you going to go investigate Tae Gong Shil today ?
I don 't have to do that anymore .
- We know everything about each other now .
- It 's all over ? Darn , I was having fun with it .
Then let 's go out to dinner somewhere . As a way to celebrate our first day of dating .
Who says we 're dating ?
I told you that I didn 't want to date you .
Even if you say that and try to play hard to get you 're ultimately still going to fall for me .
And when we look back on this later on ... today will ultimately become the first day of us starting to date .
Is that so ?
Then let 's say that we 're dating ... but I want us to break up now .
Tae Yi Ryung .
Even though ... it 's only been a day , I mean , a minute and 37 seconds ... I still want to thank you for all the lovely memories .
I hope that you 'll be happy .
Ugh , why is it so difficult to seduce that ' Salary Man ' ?
That noise . Did you hear that ?
Yes , I just hearing something chime .
I wonder if someone 's in there playing with the piano ?
We should go check it out .
Team Leader Kang . Did you feel that sudden chill ?
Go check over there .
- I 'll go check the auditorium .
- Okay .
This is driving me crazy .
Who 's there ?
Who 's there !
My hand ... my hand !
Team Leader Kang !
My hand !
Isn 't this the pianist who 's having the concert here soon ?
My hand !
I came to check the condition of the piano that I 'll be performing on . But your security team member came up and attacked me ... and this is what he did to my hand .
I really am sorry for what he did .
But ... According to our head security he said he didn 't attack you severely enough to hurt your hand like that .
This hand is used to perform a very delicate performance . But ... I can 't move my hand anymore .
I ... can 't go on with my concert .
This is seriously going to drive me crazy .
I heard that Ruijjang person has been in a major slump ever since his wife died .
I think that he 's just lying to get out of playing at his concert .
I think that Team Leader Kang Woo is being played .
How did Team Leader Kang fall into his play ?
The atmosphere that night was very eerie , and something about it felt creepy .
Team Leader Kang was for some reason very tense and nervous .
A condition unlike how he normally is .
My ... name is Tae Gong Shil and I 'm a member of a special customer service here at Kingdom .
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment ?
I have nothing to say .
I can see you .
You 're ... Ruijjang 's wife , right ?
It 's the shape of a sun .
What is ?
This necklace .
I 'm sure having this as a talisman would put Ms. Tae more at ease .
A talisman ?
Ms. Tae came to me earlier and said something peculiar to me .
This is the pen that President Joo uses every day to sign his documents , right ?
Will it be alright if I keep this with me while he 's away on his business trip ?
I think keeping this with me as a talisman is going to help me feel more secure .
She was acting like she was fine but I guess she is worried about being here without me .
If you gave her one of those instead of that pen
I 'm sure it would make Ms. Tae very happy .
During the ancient times , the sun used to be the ultimate god . It was always revered .
Let 's go .
Why did I buy this ?
This really doesn 't add up .
What are you doing here ?
Didn 't Chief Secretary Kim tell you ?
Tell me what ?
When I went to talk to Chief Secretary Kim , he told me that you 'd have it . He told me to come over and talk to you about it .
There 's no way Chief Secretary Kim could 've seen it . - I bought it on my own .
- But you have it , right ?
Then please excuse me .
I didn 't buy it because of you .
I 'm not giving it to you .
What are you talking about ?
The talisman .
The talisman ?
Did you buy a talisman because you 're afraid of the ghosts ?
I have several at home .
You could 've just asked me for one .
Then why are you here ?
I 'm going to try and see if I can take care of Ruijjang 's problem .
I ... met his wife .
She came over here with me .
Why would she come here with you ?
I need to make something with her , but I needed an oven .
Chief Secretary Kim told me to come ask you if I can use yours .
And when you open your door and let me in , I thought you knew that I was coming over .
That 's what this is about ?
But ... how much did you pay for your talisman ?
I don 't know .
The oven is over there , so use it however you 'd like .
Roll this out ?
I thought this is what she came here for and I let her in the kitchen without even realizing what I was doing .
Did you crack all the walnuts ?
I 'm cracking them right now .
Walnut ... this is your lucky day .
Do you know how expensive this thing is ?
She told me that Ruijjang is a very sensitive person .
She told me that he followed a strict regiment before his concerts .
And it was his wife who took care of all that for him .
He didn 't like smelling like food when he 'd perform his concert so the only thing he would eat is a pie that she 'd baked with a lot of cinnamon .
His wife stayed in his shadow . She always took care of her difficult and picky husband .
If I bring him a pie baked using his wife 's recipe ... she told me that the misunderstanding with Kang Woo could be resolved .
So ultimately , all of this ... was to help your ' Kang Candy ' ?
I told him about my ghosts , and I think it really shocked Kang Woo .
You should be angry after finding out the real identity of your ' Kang Candy ' .
Instead you want to help him out ?
Kang Woo apologized to me for what he did . I do feel bad for telling him something that he really didn 't want to know .
Wouldn 't you be suffering a loss as well if this concert gets canceled ?
That 's why I cracked all these walnuts for you .
Will this be thick enough for the crust ?
It needs to be thinner ?
Why is she being so picky ?
Why did you have to touch me ?
I was talking to her , and now she 's disappeared !
Are you getting angry with me right now ?
You 're the one who 's always touching me to chase away all the ghosts .
Now , you 're getting mad at me because I chased away one of your ghosts ?
I 'm sorry .
I was just caught off guard because she disappeared while I was talking to her .
She told me that he 's a really picky person and that he probably won 't eat it if the pie tastes a slightest bit different .
I 'm sorry .
Just drink a glass of this and tell that lady to come and bake it herself .
I was told doing that could be dangerous . If things go wrong , I could lose my body to them forever .
Don 't ever drink from now on . If it 's that dangerous ... then don 't ever drink again .
Okay .
You 're back .
How should I do this ?
Please watch yourself .
Honey and cinnamon ?
Kang Woo .
'Salary Man ' .
I heard you got yourself into trouble ?
- Are you worried that you might get fired ?
- Go away , I 'm not in the mood .
Just get yourself fired .
I 'd love it if you became my personal bodyguard .
You just say whatever it is that you want no matter what the other person is feeling ?
You live in a peculiar world .
I thought you were worrying about losing your job and I just said it to comfort you .
Did what I say upset you ?
I just don 't get the world of a ' Salary Man ' .
Listen , if you come to like someone who lives in a world different than yours ... what do you think you 'll do ?
I 'd first make an effort not to like that person .
- And if that doesn 't work ?
- Then you have to jump in all the way .
Something really scary that you never even would 've fathomed could jump out at you . - Could that be handled ?
- Then just like the person even more .
If you like someone a whole lot , then you can 't see anything else .
When you like someone that much ... how can you even notice anything scary lurking around ?
You 're right .
I just need to like her even more .
That 's rather simple .
I don 't like you that much yet .
That 's a relief .
I came here out of my concern for you but you 're leaving now that you 're done speaking ?
If I follow him now , then it means I like him too much .
I don 't like you that much !
No , I don 't .
President Joo , do you think he 'll come when we call him ?
I 'm sure he 'll be angry if we call him this late at night .
If this doesn 't work , then the concert and everything else is over .
Because President Joo is a very special person to me .
I 'm sure everything will be fine .
Was he talking about ' Big Sun ' ?
Crap .
I just told him to like her even more .
I don 't think I can perform at the concert without you by my side .
What is it that you 're trying to do by calling me out here this late at night ?
The number of walnuts used in here are exactly the same as the number of black keys on the piano board and the number of crust lines are the same as the number of the white keys .
You have to eat this before your concerts so that you don 't make any mistakes during your performance , right ?
How did you know that ?
That 's something ... that only my wife and I know about .
Your wife told me about it .
When you tried to hurt your hand it was your wife who called for help . That 's how Kang Woo arrived in time to save you .
Then ... are you saying ... that my wife was watching over me ?
Your fingers didn 't get hurt ... and you can move them just fine , can 't you ?
Do you ... see my wife ?
I ... I need to see her , too .
Please help me at least talk to her .
You just told me that she 's here . But I can 't see nor feel her around me .
Once ... just once . Please let me see my wife just one more time .
She just left so suddenly ... I didn 't even get to say goodbye .
You ... never did anything to hurt my hand .
I 'm sorry .
It 's a relief to hear that you weren 't hurt .
But what made you come here and apologize to me like this ?
The person who relayed my wife 's message to me ... told me to come here and make sure to apologize to you .
I thought ... that your wife had passed away .
My wife ... has always been by my side .
I feel sure of that now .
I 'm going to have a great concert . Because my wife will be by my side .
A lot of times , when a person dies so suddenly ... the people left behind have a tough time accepting the death .
And I think that Ruijjang is one of those people .
Since you baked him the pie and helped him perform at his concert there 's no need for you to worry about him on top of all that either .
You . Is it okay for you to be touching and holding just anyone like that ?
That man ... was sticking himself to you .
What else was I supposed to do when he was looking at me so sadly ?
If I hadn 't stopped you in the middle of it ... I bet you would 've let him cry in your arms all night .
Don 't you ever worry about yourself ?
When you worry about others so much like that .
- What about me ?
- Tomorrow .
I 'm going to be gone and out of your life for a week starting tomorrow and doesn 't that even worry you ?
The only person in your life who can hold you and protect you will be gone and doesn 't that make you nervous at all ?
Well ... I don 't have as many ghosts hanging around me lately as I used to .
I was so frightened when I used to be surrounded by them . But now that there are less of them around ... it 's not so bad anymore .
Is that so ?
If that 's the case ... then why did you take my favorite pen ?
My pen . Hand it over .
I didn 't think Chief Secretary Kim would tell you about that .
Is it not in here ?
I must 've lost it .
Just take it out of my paycheck .
Fine , Tae Gong Shil . Just take the pen and get away from me .
Get away !
Ruijjang ?
I 've been waiting for you .
I came to talk to you about my outfit for the concert .
I need my wife to choose it for me .
Since I can 't see or talk to her myself , I need you to help me with it .
Why are you just standing there ?
Let 's go , we have a ton of things to do to get ready .
My wife used listen to my final rehearsal before the show . She always gave me her opinion of my performance .
So I need you to relay to me what she says , okay ?
The person who relayed my wife 's message asked me to come apologize to you . She asked me to make sure to come and apologize to you .
Is Tae Gong Shil able to see Ruijjang 's dead wife ?
That 's right .
And thanks to that , you were able to get yourself out of a real sticky mess .
I saw her talking to him .
Do you believe everything she tells you about what she sees ?
Tae Gong Shil has a radar that no one else has , and I 'm utilizing that for what I need .
If it 's hard for you to accept that , then just ignore it .
When you say that you use her ... does it mean that she helps you speak to Cha Hee Joo ?
That 's correct .
Then it 's the same thing as you using Tae Gong Shil ... just like the way the pianist uses her to speak to his late wife ? That 's why you 've kept her by your side .
It 's not that Tae Gong Shil herself is special . You 're just using her to speak to someone else that is special to you .
Is that correct ?
That 's right .
Then ... I 'll be leaving now .
My ten billion radar .
I know that my calculations are right . But it really feels lousy to be compared to that pianist .
I know my calculations are right .
This one ? Okay .
She 's telling you to dress like this .
That 's just my wife 's style .
I 'm not your wife .
Helping you get dressed in her place isn 't something that I don 't think I can do for you .
Yes , I guess you 're right .
It would be so nice if I could be with her directly instead of having to go through you .
I 'll go change and be right back .
Your husband is a pretty difficult person .
Gong Shil .
- I brought you the cinnamon tea .
Will this be enough ... of the cinnamon scent ?
He likes it really strong , doesn 't he ?
What 's going on here ?
Is ... there someone here ?
It 's the wife of the pianist who 'll be performing his concert here today .
I 'm doing everything that she used to do for him .
I have to give it to him in that cup ?
Hey , what are you doing ?
He needs his wife to stay with him for him to have a successful concert .
He 's being so difficult . I rather just tell his wife to use me to do it herself .
What are you saying ?
You said if things go wrong , they may never leave your body once they 're in .
That won 't happen as long as I stay conscious .
Sorry , Gong Ri .
I shouldn 't have said that and worried you .
Gong Shil .
Just tell him to drink his tea , and let 's just go .
But there 's something else that I need to do for him right before the concert .
Here , take this .
- The business trip .
- What ?
- Hang on .
- Hey !
Master Joo .
You have to get going .
Okay .
There 's a man over there who always sits next to that trash can .
Give me a minute .
You over there .
Are you friends with Tae Gong Shil ?
I 'm going to throw this away in here .
You can either tell her to get this or not .
Let 's sit here and take a little break .
Why is it doing that ?
Let 's just go .
He 's already gone .
The pill I used to take to help me fall asleep without you is going to bring you back to me .
I 'll soon be able to see you in this dress again .
- Where have you been ?
- I had to go see someone real quick .
Here , drink some tea .
- Me ?
- You can drink the tea in her place , right ?
The cinnamon scent is really strong .
[ President Joo ]
This woman is ready .
When are you going to get here , Honey ?
You 're all checked in .
It 's time for you to go in .
Check his fingers again one more time before the concert starts .
His fingers are fine now .
We just stopped by to see how you 're feeling .
Everything is perfect right now .
Because I have her with me .
Who is she ?
Bang Shil ?
Bang ... Bang Shil ?
- Bang Shil ?
- She 's my muse who inspires me to play .
We won 't be able to say our goodbyes after the concert is over .
We 'll be leaving for France immediately following the concert .
You have to help me tune up .
Shall we go ?
The blanket clad Bang Shil is Ruijjang 's muse ?
When did that happen ?
What in the world is she ?
Isn 't that Tae Gong Shil ?
Dressed like that , she looks like a totally different person .
Yes , she does .
What is it ?
Did you and Tae Gong Shil break up ?
Is that why you called me when I 'm leaving for my business trip ?
Tae Gong Shil is with Ruijjang right now .
Is that right ?
I guess she wasn 't able to refuse him and ended up going to him after all .
You know about it , too ?
Is Tae Gong Shil really his muse ?
What ?
She looks and is acting like a different person .
Ah ... did you also know that she 's leaving to go with him to France ?
She 's going where ?
She 's going to France with him .
They 're leaving as soon as the concert is over .
I 'm so happy that you 've come back .
We 'll be able to go back to living the way we used to once we 're away from here .
Someone may find out what 's going on and may try to stop us . I 'll go perform the concert by myself , so you go home and hide out there .
I can go finish up the concert by myself , so you just hurry up and go on home .
Rui .
See ? You can do this without me .
It 's only because we 're stuck in this situation right now .
That 's why .
People can change when their circumstance changes .
I 'm not here anymore .
So , it 's time for you to change .
But you 're standing right here in front of me .
I 'm just borrowing her for a moment . So that I can do one last thing to make you come to your senses .
It gave me a slight satisfaction to see you become a bumbling idiot without me .
I 've lived all my life as a shadow by your side .
And to see you living perfectly fine without me ... would 've probably pissed me off .
Did you ... leave me because I made you feel too suffocated ?
Is that what happened ?
I thought that I was the reason why your heart stopped suddenly and I couldn 't endure the agony of that thought .
I couldn 't let you go without knowing that there 's another reason for why you left me .
The whole time that my heart was beating , I lived to serve you . But now that my heart is no longer beating ... please just let me go .
I prepared everything you ever needed in your life with my own hands .
You always stood in the bright spotlight on the stage by yourself .
You have to do all that by yourself now .
It 's not that you 're especially sensitive ... but it 's just that you 're extremely lazy .
You need to fix that .
Honey .
Honey .
I thought Master Joo left for China ?
Tae Gong Shil .
Mr. Joo Joong Won , you came .
Are you the wife who came over to my house and made me crack all those walnuts ?
Have you come to rescue Ms. Tae ?
Now that I 'm here , it 's time for you to leave now .
If I just leave ... I can 't let you in on the secret .
Aren 't you even curious to know ?
Curious to know how this woman views you ?
This is fun .
Are you asking me if I like that man ?
Is it that obvious ?
But there 's someone else whom he already likes .
So , I have to keep my feelings for him a secret .
I can let you in on the secret .
- I don 't want to know .
Are you afraid that once you know , the calculations won 't add up ?
Why do you continue to keep her by your side when the calculation doesn 't add up as is ?
I don 't want to leave her body because I 'm curious to know about your secrets , too .
Take a good look , and get lost .
Tae Gong Shil .
Are you okay ?
I must 've fallen asleep here , Kang Woo .
Wasn 't President Joo Joong Won just here ?
President Joo ?
Isn 't he away on his business trip ?
What is all this ?
Why am I dressed up in this ?
Don 't you remember ... being with Ruijjang ?
I think something must 've gone wrong .
- What ... have I been doing ?
- Are you sure that you 're okay ?
Let 's get you home .
Is Ms. Tae okay ?
I 'm not okay .
You 've been working hard to keep that woman by my side , haven 't you ?
So , you 've noticed ?
Why did you do that ?
It 's been nice ... to see you change .
If that woman remains by my side ... then I 'm going to continue to change , won 't I ?
I ... don 't want to change .
[ A week later ]
He should be back today .
This has been the longest week ever .
He hasn 't answered any of my calls either .
What got into you to start a conversation with me today ?
Excuse me ?
There 's what ?
What is this ?
President Joo ?
Really ?
This is a sunburst .
It 's so pretty .
Tae Gong Shil .
- Have you heard the news ?
- What news ?
I see you haven 't heard .
It really is a rather sudden news .
- What is it ?
- Master Joo just returned from China .
Really ?
Hear me out first before you go .
She 's going to get the shock of her life . This is big trouble .
President Joo !
- Is President Joo back ?
- He 's on his way in right now .
Was it a nice trip ?
But the thing is ...
- Chief Secretary Kim .
- Yes .
- Have you told her the news ?
- No , not yet .
Ms. Tae Gong Shil .
Please congratulate Joong Won when you see him .
My Joong Won , I mean , President Joo is getting married .
Oh , here they come now .
That 's the lady who 'll be marrying President Joo .

[ Next Episode Preview ]
I really can 't stand men that are filthy assholes like you .
Are you saying that Cha Hee Joo is still alive ?
I have a feeling that she 's still nearby .
Who are you ?
Have you called me here ?
I 'm going to lean on you .
- I 'll leave before you tell me to get lost .
- Wait . Get lost .
Do you think that you 're important enough to me to get in the way of my marriage ?
I can 't be your candy girl .
- But he just ignores you .
- I can 't be without President Joo .
- Doesn 't it hurt ?
- I like him .
- Don 't ' go to him .
- I want to be with him .
- Why didn 't you come to me ?
If the defective ghost is gone , if you are " Tae Gong Sil " , listen carefully .
Since you couldn 't say it directly , but pretended to be a ghost as an excuse , the idea that you still want me to get lost , I won 't believe it .
I started it because you told me you can deal with it .
If it becomes too difficult for you , it 'll be over .
Now what are you going to do ?
I think something ( a ghost ) came in and went out for a moment .
Thank you for helping me come back .
It 's a relief that you came back safely .
But why did you come here ?
You said it was your home after " I 've decided ! "
Did you forget that the date location was your house ?
You are much more daring than I thought .
Now where are you going ?
I said " I " was coming home , not inviting you .
When you burst into my house , I don 't remember inviting you , either .
For two people who even " slept " together on their first night , what do you mean an invitation ?
So , where should I sit ?
Don 't sit , just go .
You don 't even have a seat to offer anyway .
But is this your entire apartment ?
There really isn 't any place for a ghost to hide .
Can I sit here ?
I understood everything you said , I want to be safe , too , so just go .
I didn 't come in to be in danger .
Am I sure of myself ?
I 'm still not ready yet .
You were the one who made it dangerous before .
Didn 't you ?
Earlier , that was ... because I thought a ghost possessed you .
Well ... driving them away is all the same , either touching with fingers , toes , or lips .
It would 've been the same even if you had hit me .
I don 't even have pride to deny you , or don 't even have a heart to be hurt .
Why would I care , when I 'm scared to death ?
Same here .
It upsets me that my heart keeps going to you and it hurts my pride ... because I can 't control it .
So I 'm scared to death , too .
But I 'm here .
So , don 't drive me out .
It 's awkward to say this after coming in , but ... invite me in .
You even invited ghosts to your office , and had coffee with them before .
Let me have some , too .
I got it .
I 'll give you the most bitter one , one that you " love " the most .
Not even a little sweet .
Thanks for considering my taste .
I was invited .
It 's crammed so ... get lost !
She said that she doesn 't even love him that much . Why does she keep shamelessly sticking onto Joong Won ?
People say that to the Master , the death of Cha Hee Joo is a curse .
Tae Yang says that it 's a scar .
I believe that Tae Yang can treat his wound .
What is she that she can do that ?
To treat a wound , you need to approach it , but the master ( Joong Won ) doesn 't allow anyone to approach him .
If she is driven out , she comes back .
Even if she is pulled out , she just sticks to him again .
Not anyone can do that .
You mean ... she caught him with all she 's got ?
Wound ?
To me .. it seems she caught his weakness .
Well ... his heart did get caught .
He is calculating the best way to get to the exit .
He is actually thinking about getting away from her ?
I think he went in , hoping there will be an exit , but ... I doubt he will find one .
So , you were hiding in this place before you met me ?
Yeah .
At least , this was where I felt most comfortable .
Beer ?
But you can 't drink .
It 's Kang Woo 's , not mine .
Why is Kang Woo 's beer is in your fridge ?
Cause we drink it sometimes , right outside the bench . It 's for our convenience .
If Kang Woo drinks the beer right outside the bench ... then , what do you do ?
I can 't drink alcohol , so I just drink cider . ( sprite / 7up ... )
Your fridge is already so small , I don 't think you have space for his beer .
I do have a space for his beer .
So , just leave it .
I put so much money into your account .
Move to a better place .
I told you , that I feel most comfortable here .
Kang Woo 's salary is quite high as well .
Why is he living here ?
He said he 'll get an apartment .
Really ?
Have some .
Where are you going ?
How can you leave a guest ?
Coffee and fruits are all there , so wait here .
I 'm sure that the name had two syllables ..
Kang Woo ?
Why is it so long ?
What am I doing right now ?
Just read the last message .
One toy for each sentence .
I 'll let the Kingdom Kid 's Mall know , so show them this and pick what you want .
Thank you . ( formal )
But Mister , you 're an adult ...
Don 't you know Korean ?
I know English , Japanese , Chinese , Spanish .
Total of 5 languages .
Korean ... I have my reason , so I just don 't read it . Read that .
Yes !
" Tae Gong Sil ...
I have a favor to ask of you .
I heard that it will rain tonight .
Please take in the blanket that I left on the rooftop .
Don 't separate the trash alone .
I love you . "
What ?
!
Oh ! Do it with me .
That surprised me .
Tae Gong Sil ...
You even bring Kang Candy 's blanket in ?
Should I just buy this whole building ?
So , are you the CEO ?
Why ?
Did Tae Gong Sil say anything about the CEO ?
Yeah .
She said he 's the most special person in the world .
Really ?
You are young , so you 're innocent and honest .
I won 't think that you are flattering for just a toy .
Use it for anything you want .
Didn 't you see the search engines ?
If you just come here like this and get caught by the reporters , it won 't be good .
Did you do this on purpose ?
I told you already .
Reporters can write about it because of the pictures from the train station .
Don 't worry because a different article will go out tomorrow .
What different article ?
Is it going out in the celebrity info program ? not just a # 1 in the search engine ?
Person who 's in scandal with me , might be .
But , don 't worry .
You 're not coming out .
What ?
I ... will have a scandal news with CEO , Joo Joong Won .
With CEO , Joo Joong Won ?
To protect you with me , I had no choice .
Why ?
Are you worried about Tae Gong Sil ?
How are you ?
Me
Yeah .
You have nothing with him . But are you okay with it ?
You are a celebrity .
You !
Don 't worry about me .
You dumped me and now you 're trying to keep me on the hook ?
Don 't look at me like that .
Just glare at me and get angry .
What do you want me to do ?
I don 't want to get you in trouble .
Whatever .
It 's not like this is the first time .
I 'll do it on my own .
I know what to do .
Leave !
Call me if you need anything .
Didn 't you leave yet ?
I was invited in so I should leave after being shown out by the owner of the house .
Bye ...
Did you bring his blankets in well and leave the recycling that you 're to do together ?
You read it ?
Yeah , I read it .
But you can 't read !
I don 't read .
Even if I don 't read it with my own eyes , if I want to read it , I have many ways to get it done .
Of course .
You can do anything you want .
If you want to know , you 'll know ; and if you don 't want to know , you can ignore it .
- Lucky you .
- But I 'm doing that by making deals .
Mr. CEO ,
I thought of a way you can relax ( about their relationship )
You know that story about the wolf and goat ?
Do you know why the goat felt secure even when it was next to a wolf that could eat it ?
It 's because the goat knew how much the wolf liked the goat .
The wolf liked the goat so much , that the goat knew that the wolf would never eat it but would protect it . So the goat could relax .
You relax , too .
I will protect you like the wolf .
Please trust me .
Go now .
They said that it would rain .
Go before it starts to pour .
I really don 't like rainy days .
What do I do ?
It 's so scary ...
Why haven 't you left yet ?
You said that you 're scared of water ghosts the most .
If it rains and a ghost appears , it 's a water ghost .
Isn 't it times like this that you need me ?
It is a little scarier on rainy days .
But I just told you to leave really coolly ...
How can I ask you to stay now ?
You told me that you would protect me and to trust you , so I 'll trust you and leave later .
( I 'm ok ... )
Sleep .
We 're really only going to hold hands and sleep .
You can 't think of other things .
I trust you .
Oh , it 's hot .
What ?
Sleep .
Lay back .
Since you 're the only one who can drive them away , she says that she can 't even get rid of you and that it hurts .
She 's really hurt , you jerk .
I 'll let it slide as you letting me know that she 's in pain .
Because I have no intention of hugging her because she 's hurting .
Using a ghost as an excuse to hug her , is ok .
♫ Although I want to only wait to approach you quietly ,
♫ Your distance won 't become any less . ♫
♫ It 's okay even if I can 't hug you . ♫
♫ Lonely love , yes I love you , ♫
I 'm upset that I 'm becoming more and more attached to you and it hurts my pride that I can 't stop it .
That 's why I 'm also scared to death .
He 's so scared he can 't read .
I can 't scare him too .
Tae Yi Ryeong double scandal !
Who is her other man ?
You should admit it 's you , Mr. CEO .
You already have 4 other people on your record so it shouldn 't be a big deal .
Tae Yi Ryung said it was you , so it 'll look better .
I don 't like it .
Your face is all over the internet anyways .
It won 't be much to go on and sell your face a little more .
Team Leader Kang should admit it .
I don 't like it either .
Excuse me .
If you guys both refuse , it 'll make Tae Yi Ryung look bad .
We might be able to say she 's been playing both of us and got found out .
She 's my Kingdom model , and we can 't make her image look any worse .
Fine , then .
We both won 't deny that it was us .
Good .
Did Tae Gong Shil see the article ?
Yes , she came by earlier and saw the article .
What did she say ?
She didn 't seem like she cared much .
Where is she now ?
She said that there was a ghost around the entrance of the mall so she went to find it .
Ahjusshi , please take one .
Please take one !
Please look at this .
Please .
Please look at this .
Please look at my child .
Unni .
That woman must be looking for her child .
That face isn 't one of a living person 's ...
How heartbroken she must be ...
It 's so sad .
Her son is right next to her .
Please .
What , you can see him ?
Her son is dead .
Oh , thank you !
That woman thinks that her child is alive and looking for him like this ...
Eonnie , should I go and tell her ?
How do you tell a mom that her son is dead ?
If she hears that , she 'll probably faint .
Don 't do it .
Oh , what to do !
Oh , are you okay ?
Let me help you .
Thank you !
Here , please take one .
If I don 't tell her , then she might look for her son forever .
Where did he go ... ?
- One minute , Eonnie
- Hey , Gong Shil !
You 're Woo Jin , right ?
Hello !
It says that you like this snack , right ?
Come out , we can talk for a minute .
What is she doing ?
Does that weird characteristics ( lit. fourth-dimensional ) work on him ?
It 's Tae Yi Ryeong .
About Tae Yi Ryeong 's scandal , I know the truth .
What is it ?
The two men don 't like her ...
They like her .
I should be careful of a scandal .
Anyhow , I told the reporters so that you can back out of it .
This , I only ate with .
This , I only had tea with .
You 're grateful , right ?
Both of you , don 't get on my nerves . Because , if you do , I 'm going to get that one involved .
My model contract is almost expiring , so I guess I would have no business coming here .
I 'm going to renew the contract with you .
Really ?
Because I don 't want people to think I ended the contract due to the scandal of just eating together .
Then , at the fall Kingdom autograph event , I guess Chief Kang will be escorting her .
Since that 's , my job .
If the contract is renewed , I guess there will be many reasons to come to Kingdom .
Secretary Kim .
Tell Vice President to negotiate down the model fee .
It 's okay .
Big Sun !
Did you see the article about me ?
Yes , I saw it .
You 're fine , aren 't you ?
Are you okay ?
I hate a salary man , as well as the cursed man .
Are you clung onto CEO Joo Joong Won because you want to be the fifth cursed person ?
You 're right in that I 'm clung onto him , but I have no intention of getting off of him , so I 'm not going to get cursed .
I guess if you don 't , CEO Joo Joong Won will be the one who will .
Do you think a curse is a fish sauce hit-and-miss game ? As if you can avoid it if you want to ?
If it 's a curse from a dead person , I guess I would be able to avoid that at least .
Since I see dead people .
Right ?
Let 's go .
She 's still looking for him .
This ... I need to burn it some place else .
Man ...
I have to get rid of what 's in here quickly .
There 's a kid sitting here .
But his mom thinks he 's still alive , so she 's looking for him .
But it says ' missing ' here , which means he went through something very horrible .
Whatever I ask him , he 's scared and won 't say anything .
So ... now ... are you saying we have to comfort an invisible kid ?
You would feel very bewildered the first time you go through this .
I 've even followed an invisible dog .
What do I need to do ?
I heard you 're scared of this stuff .
If you can 't handle it , you may leave .
I decided not to avoid scary things .
And ... I feel really bad for both the kid and his mom .
Miss Tae Gong Shil .
What do I need to do ?
Thank you , Mr. Kang Woo .
It says here that he likes to sing children 's songs .
Should I sing a song ?
He 's wearing a t-shirt with the picture of a teddy bear .
I guess he likes a teddy bear very much .
Then , " Three Bears " will be good .
I will sing the song .
No ... You would feel shy singing it alone , so how about we take a turn with each phrase .
You said the kid 's name is Woo Jin , right ?
Woo Jin .
These ahjussis will sing a song , so listen well , okay ?
Chief Kang .
Cue .
There are three bears in one house .
Daddy bear , mommy bear , baby bear .
Daddy bear is fat .
Mommy bear is thin .
Baby bear is so cute .
Shrug , shrug , you 're doing so good .
He 's smiling .
Do it again .
There are three bears in one house .
Daddy bear , mommy bear , baby bear .
Daddy bear is fat .
Mommy bear is thin .
Baby bear is so cute .
Shrug , shrug , you 're doing so good .
Shru ...
Shrug , shrug , you 're doing so good .
Shrug ...
That 's enough .
At the very moment Miss Tae Gong Shil had an accident , she was having the time of her life .
But at the age of 24, she had a sudden , unknown accident , and after being hospitalized for 3 years , at the age of 27 , she suddenly got up , and after maintaining the life of a loser , she joined Kingdom a while ago .
So what was that accident ?
That ... I haven 't found out yet .
You ... Last night , you went to the grilled heart restaurant with Tae Gong Shil 's sister and even brought the receipts .
What did you ask her while eating there ?
That 's why I arranged a meeting with her at a pork feet restaurant .
I will definitely find out what kind of accident Tae Gong Shil was involved in .
Are you going around famous restaurants ?
I 'm sorry ... I 'm just a little obsessed with food .
The grill hearts were good last night .
Today , I 'll buy you a pork feet dinner .
No .
But yesterday we were talking about your sister 's accident , and you fell unconscious after drinking a lot of soju . So we didn 't get to talk about the rest too much .
It was getting really interesting .
You 're right .
I did have quite a few drinks while talking about it .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm not going to talk about such a depressing story any more .
I 'm okay- -
- I 'll see you at the port feet restaurant .
I missed a change to talk about the important stuff while talking about what happened in the military .
But how come she listens to the story of playing soccer in the military ( boring story ) so well that I can 't stop talking about it .
She 'll come to the pork feet restaurant thinking I 'll tell her funny stories , but why does my foot so numb ( guilty ) ?
Did the accident happen here ?
How come no one saw you die ?
Did he hide it ?
How could .. not see ..
How strange .
Miss .
Are you looking for something ?
No , well ...
Has there been an accident around here by any chance ?
No , not really .
No ?
How strange .
That ... are you looking for that kid ?
Yes .
Thank you .
Huh ?
Did she see something ?
No , there was no one .
She didn 't recognize me , either .
Please take a look .
Ahjussi , please look at it .
That 's my baby , please ?
Unni , please have a look .
That 's my baby .
Ahjussi .
Please take a look at this .
Unni , this ...
Please take a look .
Excuse me .
Please look at this .
It 's my baby .
Please .
Please have a look .
This kid is dead , but the mom ...
But should I tell her ?
If she 's not aware , she 's going to live in pain , but she knows , she 'll want to die with him .
She 'll have to live suffering for the rest of her life with her dead baby next to her .
I feel so sad for her .
The kid 's mom doesn 't see the dead boy .
If you tell her that you see the dead boy , you 'll become a really horrible person to her .
If you find out where he is , don 't do anything on your own and just call the police .
I should do that , right ?
Were you also like that the first time ?
When I told you I saw dead Cha Hee Joo . Was I horrible to you ?
I hated that she stayed near me for such a long time .
Are you saying you 're seeing Joong Won to treat him ?
There 's nothing you can do .
Joong Won is doing very well .
He can 't read yet .
You really got his weakness .
Fine .
What is it that you can do ?
Can you call up dead Hee-Joo ?
If I call her up , then will his wounds heal ?
Bang-shil , if I say it nicely , you can 't understand me .
I 'll put it simply : leave Joong-won alone .
He buried ( the past ) well and he 's been fine .
Also , because the statute of limitations is expiring soon , you should forget it .
You sticking with him and making him think about Hee-Joo is worse off .
Leave him alone .
Auntie , if I bring up Hee Joo is it really so terrifying ?
Now you 're understanding me .
Yes , it 's terrifying ; so leave him alone .
Why are there so many words ?
Ah , I 'm thirsty .
Did she drink beer with Chief Kang today too ?
Why are you here ?
To entrust you with my beer .
Why are you leaving your beer here ?
There is no room for my beer in my fridge .
Does that even make sense ?
Your fridge is as big as my house .
why doesn 't it have room ?
There 's none .
Do you want to go see ?
Pack your cider , and you can come to my house .
Forget it .
My small fridge has no room for your beer .
Take it back .
If you make room , then there 's room .
Look , it fits so well in here .
Hmm , there 's one less beer .
( Did he ) drink one within that timespan ?
How did you know ?
We just drank earlier .
Kang-woo 's police friend said he 'll check up on the place I went earlier today and drank a beer ...
Why did you tell that to Kang Woo , not to me ?
You said it was terrifying .
It 's totally understandable .
I 'll take care of it .
You don 't have to take care of Hee-Joo problem .
You said you saw Hee-Joo through me ,
Did Hee Joo say something to you that last time ?
Something very shocking ?
You didn 't get tricked , Joong-won .
It would be nice if you could go back to the way you were before .
I love you .
Yes , she said something very shocking .
I didn 't get tricked . And to come back to my past self . And that she loves me .
If she said that , don 't you think something is wrong ?
Kang-woo said he found something strange about Hee-joo .
Did you perhaps ask him what it was ?
I didn 't want to know it , so I left it alone .
It 's that scary ?
Yes .
Then do you want to handle it ?
Now that I think about it , if you want to stay next to me , It might be one of the biggest things you need to handle .
When we 're alone together and Hee-joo appears , then you 'll see her .
If you see a ghost that loves me , You might feel very dirty .
Even if you see her , don 't let me know .
Touch me inconspicuously , and she 'll disappear , and you 'll feel even worse about chasing her away .
Even then , it 'd be better than being all three of us together .
Can you handle it ?
You can 't right ?
If you cant handle it , then don 't bother me .
I can handle it .
That 's what I 'm best at .
Don 't leave it alone and find out what it is .
You couldn 't even read for 15 years .
Don 't you think you need to at least read now ?
It 's embarrassing running away from your fears .
Let go , I 'm going .
It 's embarrassing . Let me go .
♫ Why do you keep running away from me ?
♫
♫ Why do you keep getting further away from me ?
♫
♫ Stay by my side . ♫
It 's embarrassing that I haven 't read a single book .
Since I started , you I 'm gonna finish you .
How long does the wolf hold on , and how arrogant the sheep is .
♫ You make me cry ♫
♫ You 're almost close enough for me to catch you . ♫
♫ But when I reach for you , you move farther away like the wind . ♫
♫ Love , which leaves you alone . ♫
♫ Love only leaves me in tears . ♫
♫ That worthless , that foolish ... love ♫
The CEO hasn 't asked me about Cha Hee-Joo yet .
Yes , I 'll be waiting .
Team Leader !
Did you see the article about Tae Yi Ryeong being hospitalized ?
I saw it , it must be her time to get sick .
So coldhearted .
He 's a chic Dooly .
Is she really sick ... ?
Kang Woo .
Aren 't you a bit much ?
About what ?
I know you saw the article .
Can 't you at least come with soju and dried squid to visit ?
( Literal ) Isn 't that what you call taking care of your aquarium ?
Just with soju and squid , do you think I 'm a fish that can be contained in a Salaryman 's aquarium ?
I 'm a whale that even the Pacific Ocean knows about .
You 're right ; you can be a whale .
Thanks to you , my friend that works in China contacted me saying he saw me on the newspaper .
Your ... ( aquarium ) isn 't big enough to raise a whale , right ?
Yes .
I can 't handle a whale .
How about a dolphin ... ?
Even if you stoop to an anchovy 's level , I don 't want to raise you in my aquarium .
Who said I 'll stoop to an anchovy 's level for you ?
Are you crazy ?
♫ I 'm visualizing you , ♫
♫ These moments right here . ♫
♫ What do they mean to you for me and to me for you ?
♫
♫ I will become ♫
♫ a comfort without sadness for you . ♫
♫ Remember , I will always be here . ♫
♫ It 's so strange , living life . ♫
♫ It 's like an unsolvable puzzle . ♫
Chief Kang .
Joong Won wants a report on Hee Joo .
My father said to hear the explanation from you , so explain it to me .
You called me up so fast .
These are the last instructions that my father has given you .
Are you going to leave now ?
I 'm not leaving .
You 're guarding a shopping mall to the end with more than enough ability to even guard the Blue House .
I heard you have an apartment .
What 's the reason for staying at the dorm ?
Until you resolve the Cha Hee-joo problem , and Tae Gong Shil becomes useless to you , I 'll wait until then .
What 's inside here ?
Explain it to me .
Your father coincidentally found this in Europe This picture .
Cha Hee-joo !
He thinks Cha Hee-joo is alive , and he thinks she 's somewhere near by you .
Hee Joo is dead .
Who is this girl that looks exactly like her ?
The girl in the picture is supposedly Agatha Christy 's passionate fan .
Even on the card that she sent , her pen-name is the fictional character , " Wargrave " .
Wargrave .
It 's an unforgettable name .
" He was invited to this place by some sort of maniac . "
And , there was no one there .
... he might be this awful murderer .
It was the name of the criminal from the novel I last read .
Hee-joo was an orphan .
Was there a twin sister ?
And is that , the accomplice she wants to protect ?
Hee Joo !
Hee Joo !
Get out !
Hee Joo !
Let me go !
Who 's the one that died ?
I 'm sorry , Joo Joong Won .
The person you want to protect , I need to find her .
Joo Joong Won , you came here to meet Cha Hee Joo ?
I 'm thankful .
I need to know where you are so I can tell your mom .
Is that missing child still there ?
Yes .
He won 't talk .
After being dragged into your world , I listened to what you saw and heard , but Actually , I can 't see or hear anything .
I 'm just listening to you and looking at you .
After only looking at you , I guess I 'm completely spellbound .
You 're right .
It 's all my fault .
Yes , it 's all your fault .
Also knowing everything about Hee Joo , is also all your fault .
Tae Gong Shil , I just came back from visiting Hee Joo .
Good job .
These days I 'm even looking at books .
You can read words ?
I can 't read , I 'm not improving .
But I 'm still looking at it .
Which book ?
There 's this book ... it 's a very high level book .
Total 6 Volumes of hard cover , binding in western style , and while I 'm reading , I think my brain is going to crumble .
It must be a very good book .
You have to read it all the way to the end .
Once I read it to the end , then , I 'll have improved and won 't be embarrassed .
I have to go out for a meeting ,
I 'll go with you to tell the mother .
Thank you for saying you 'll do it together .
Se Jin will go to today 's meeting .
Secretary Kim , you go to the orphanage Hee Joo grew up in .
Why do you want me to go there ?
If Hee Joo has a twin , can you find that out ?
I 'll tell you the details after I come back from the meeting .
I got it .
I think he found out .
Is that way he went to Hee Joo ?
Then this girl ,
is she Hanna ?
This is the women who takes care of my nephews house , she 's the best .
My nephew has a very picky personality but she adjusts to it .
Thanks for responding to my prior request .
Please take care of me .
What 's this ?
It 's the CEO 's but he told me not to touch it .
It 's Joong Won 's ?
It looks like a fairy tale book .
Isn 't it that he still can 't read ?
How did you know that my nephew couldn 't read ?
Vice President , last time while we were drinking wine , told me , I think .
Silly him ...
Hanna , you have a heavy mouth right ?
Yes .
Is he reading this cause he likes the illustration ?
What is this ? On a Stormy Night ?
He 's reading a good book .
Do you know this book ?
It 's a well know author ,
The wolf and sheep both like each other , It 's a book about them being together .
How can a wolf and sheep be together ?
I know right , they 're things that shouldn 't be together , so one who liked more dies .
The one who liked the other most was the wolf .
The guy that I like , has been in pain for too long .
I hope that doesn 't happen to your mom .
Let 's tell her where you are now. huh ?
It 's in a dark place .
Let 's go together .
Let 's go .
Where did she go ?
Where are you going ?
Is it here ?
Who are you ?
It 's that one lady .
Ma 'am are you looking for something ?
What brings you here ?
Are you looking for something ?
Yes , I came here to find something .
What did you come to find without a car in this car center ?
Never mind , I think I 'll be going ...
Wait , since you 're here , I had something I wanted to ask you about .
Don 't leave and wait here .
Yoo Jin !
Tae Gong Shil .
Why ?
Mr. CEO . I followed Woo Jin , but ...
Woo Jin ?
The dead boy ?
I ... think I found him .
But ... here ...
Tae Gong Shil .
Where are you now ?
Miss , are you there ?
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Gong Shil !
What is this ?
Seeing that you came alone , I guess you haven 't told anybody yet .
I found Woo Jin .
He 's in Kimpo Eunseong Car Center ( auto repair shop ) .
I think the owner killed Woo Jin .
Woo Jin is inside his car trunk .
What is this ?
Why is she not answering ?
The person is unavailable , so it 's being connected to the voice mail .
You must read this .
Have to read it .
You can read it .
You will read it !
Tae Gong Shil .
Where are you ?
Kimpo ...
Eunseong ...
Car Center .
It rained very heavily in the reservoir a while ago , so the water level is high ... in the reservoir .
You 're the culprit , and due to the guilt of killing the boy , you 're now jumping in to commit suicide .
You didn 't see Woo Jin , did you ?
You cried after hitting Woo Jin .
Why didn 't you go to the hospital right away at that time ?
How do you know that ?
Huh ?
Did you see me ?
See me ?
Woo Jin told me .
Crazy bitch .
You think once a person dies , that 's the end , don 't you ?
Even now , he 's looking at you .
He 's looking at you in the exact state as the very moment when you killed him .
He 's looking at you even now , right in front of you !
Shut up !
Look here !
Nobody saw it .
She 's the only one .
Come here !
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Gong Shil !
Mr. CEO !
Tae Gong Shil !
Mr. CEO .
I told you to be careful .
You got hurt .
I 'm alright .
Did you call the police ?
Yeah .
It 's a relief that you 're okay .
What 's wrong ?
♫ Are you listening to my heart ♫
♫ Are you looking at my tears ?
♫
♫ In this world there is only one , only one ♫
♫ For me there cannot be anyone but you . ♫
♫ Why do you keep turning away from me ?
♫
♫ Why do you keep away from me ?
♫
♫ Stay with me . Please hold my hand ♫
♫ if you love me . ♫
♫ You drive me crazy . You . ♫
♫ You make me cry . ♫ You .
♫ When I reach for you almost to grasp you , you move away like the wind . ♫
Surgery :
Joo Joong Won in progress . ♫ Love , which makes you alone , ♫
Mei continued to call Gabu tirelessly . ♫ Love which leaves tears behind ... ♫
Bye , Gabu .
They end up not living together , and , really , the one that likes the other more is the only one that dies .
What kind of story is this .
So you were right .
You ... are bright like the sun .
No ...
Am I ... dead ?
It feels so unfair ... but still ... since my woman can see me , I can at least say this to you before I go .
Tae Gong Shil .
I love you .
♫ You drive me crazy . You . ♫
♫ You make me cry . You . ♫
♫ When I reach for you almost to grasp you , you move away like the wind . ♫
♫ Love , which leaves you alone . ♫
♫ Love , which leaves tears . ♫
♫ Such ridiculous , ♫ ♫ Such foolish love . ♫
♫ It 's okay even if can 't reach you . ♫
Oh , there they are .
That woman is the one who will be marrying CEO Joo .
Nice to see you , Miss Seo Yeon .
Nice to see you .
Nice to see you , too .
Let 's head on upstairs .
Is that woman an employee here ?
She keeps looking at us .
Stop looking at her and go quickly .
I can 't stand it .
You go ahead .
Have you been doing well for the past week ?
You don 't look too bad .
For me , it was hell .
Mr. CEO , are you really getting married ?
Aren 't you curious ?
Don 't you want to know how she feels about you ?
What secret ?
I can see right through her .
Can you ... see something ?
Something that is just as scary as the ghosts you see .
CEO , are you trying to avoid me ? Are you getting married so that you don 't have to see me again ?
Tae Gong Shil , do you think that you mean something to me , enough that it 'll affect my wedding ?
No .
Then , you don 't have the right to ask me " why . "
And I don 't have an obligation to give you an answer , right ?
Yes .
Episode 10
Your aunt already went upstairs .
Let 's go .
As I 've told you already , I hate people touching my body .
Even if you 're about to trip and fall , try to avoid touching me .
Our Master is so cold and rude , even to his fiancé !
If he 's not even going to let her touch him , why is he getting married ?
I wish he had given me a head 's up .
How could he even not answer my phone call ?
Tae Gong Shil .
Kang Woo .
Did you not know about CEO Joo Joong Won 's wedding ?
Yes .
I 'm a little surprised ... the news of it was so sudden .
The night of Louis Jang 's concert ...
CEO Joo came here , instead of going on his business trip , right ?
When you two met that night , did something happen ?
Did he come that night ?
Then , the person I saw that night ... was Mr. CEO ?
I guess I was right .
He did come here to see you .
That night , I was almost out of my mind .
I really wasn 't myself .
I think the ghost wife met Mr. CEO when she was still inside my body .
What did they talk about ?
What secret ?
I can see right through her .
She must have told him my secret !
Secret ?
I think she told him that I like Mr. CEO !
Oh , no !
Even though you need her for your business , is it really okay to use " marriage " to get what you want ?
It 's okay .
I 've used my brains to calculate the risks , and I 've come up with a good answer .
Tae Yang seemed very surprised and a little thrown off by the news .
What are you going to do ?
The reason why I can 't figure out an answer when it comes to her is because ... instead of being in my head , she was inside somewhere else .
I was surprised like hell to realize this , but I 've come to accept it .
If so , you need to tell that person how you feel .
Also , tell her that you 're not really getting married .
I don 't want to do that .
Secretary Kim . The reason why I still don 't - The reason why I can 't read ...
I want to live using my head , which works just fine .
Since Tae Yang is a person who can see ghosts and souls , don 't you think she 'll be able to see your issues and embrace them ?
Then , when I die , I 'll become a ghost ... and I 'll go visit her when that happens .
I think he 's trying to get rid of me .
But I can 't live without him !
Tae Gong Shil , your hideout ... is he the only one ?
Does it have to be him ?
He 's my one and only hideout in this world .
I just got his permission to stay by his side after begging like crazy !
Saying he 's getting married and keeping a woman by his side ... that means ... he 's telling you not to stay by his side as a woman .
Now that he 's getting married , if he knew that I liked him , he would ask me to get lost . Right ?
You said you liked him . Being ignored like this ... doesn 't it hurt ?
In your world , I 'm Candy , and Mr. CEO is Prince Charming on a white horse , right ?
But in my world , I 'm just a ghost radar , and Mr. CEO is a shelter where I can hide .
I can 't be Candy .
Because ... he has no intention of being Prince Charming .
But , I can still be useful as a radar , so I think he 'll let me stay by his side .
I think I should go see him .
Mr. CEO ... congratulations on your engagement .
What ?
Earlier , I was too surprised ... and I couldn 't tell you something important .
Congratulations on your engagement , and I wish you happiness .
You 're being scary . Why are you saying this ?
Mr. CEO , since you 're about to become someone 's sweet home , you may be uncomfortable with having a shelter . But ... instead of getting rid of it , How about leaving it underground , at about the 2nd level below ground ?
If you do that , I 'll use it lightly , from time to time , without making you feel uncomfortable .
Sweet home ?
I don 't like sweet stuff .
If not , please give birth to a son !
Give birth to a son who has the same powers as you . and if you let me take care of him .
You come in here out of the blue , and you 're going too far with this . Telling me to give birth to a son ...
Tae Gong Shil , are you acting like this because of the secret you told the nutcracker ghost ?
Did that wife tell you my secret ?
No , I didn 't hear about it .
If it was a secret , it means you wanted to hide it from me , so I didn 't dig further . I politely refused , saying that I wouldn 't hear about it .
You 're thankful , right ?
Is that what you did ?
But it really wasn 't anything .
I didn 't hear about it , but seeing how you act , it 's so obvious .
You 're being so awkward that I 'm beginning to suspect whether you even have the will to keep it a secret .
Bursting in here , saying " congratulations " , " I wish you happiness " ...
What you 're doing is exactly what that famous girl , one who says " I won 't cry even when lonely or sad " ...
You 're following her pattern !
You 're being just like her ( Candy ) !
Never mind .
This may actually make it easier .
Making the effort to congratulate me , telling me that you 'll move into the basement of my sweet home ... and since you 're also saying you 'll be my son 's ( little hideout ) nanny ; so that you won 't be embarrassed , I 'll act as if I didn 't see or hear anything .
You 're good .
It seems like you 're misunderstanding something , but that person I said I liked to that wife isn 't you . It 's someone else .
You know who it is !
I like ... very sweet things .
Also , all this time , I stayed next to you despite all the bad things you said because you were my hideout .
As a woman , I hate men like you !
Men who are mean and rude !
Fine .
I 'm grateful that I 'm not your type !
Then , I 'll leave before you tell me to get lost .
Those words ... they made me feel terrible .
Wait !
Get lost .
If you were going to make an excuse , you should have made up a different one .
Out of all things , why did it have to be Candy Kang ?
Tae Gong Shil , the VP 's wife is looking for you .
For Louis Jang to introduce you to us as his muse , I guess you must have an eye for art .
I asked you to come so you can take a look at this .
Open it and take it out .
This one ?
It 's a vase .
This is an engagement present for Joong Won sent by her family .
It might be a little crass to speak of money , but it 's extremely expens ...
Ahh ...
Do you know how expensive this is ?
I 'm sorry .
I was surprised .
I guess you 'd be surprised .
I guess this item is too much for you to handle , am I correct ?
What if you 'd broken it ?
Even the thought is scary , isn 't it ?
You 're probably thinking , " I shouldn 't have touched it . "
Yes .
That kind of stuff ... don 't touch them , they 're bad .
What ?
- Tae Gong Sil .
Calling something like this " stuff " is a little ...
It 's a very valuable white porcelain .
It 's because people now keep saying it 's so valuable , but really ... it was probably just once a water container .
Please don 't keep saying , " This is too valuable for just anyone to handle . " It will turn rude and arrogant .
What ?
Are you saying that to me ? ! ?
Well ... I 'm just speaking about the vase .
That 's right .
By analogy to this vase , " Don 't try to touch our Joong Won and break off the marriage . " I 'm saying this nicely to you , but what ?
Rude and arrogant ?
I 'm sorry .
I was just talking about this vase .
This was originally just a water container .
But the person looking at it ... can keep putting their heart in and weird things can come out .
Once you are bewitched in the wrong way , the only recourse would be to break it .
Are you not understanding because I 'm saying it nicely ?
Are you saying that you 're going to do whatever it takes to sabotage Joo Won 's marriage ?
You 're really dangerous !
I think you don 't understand because you can 't see it ... I even went and congratulated him on the engagement ...
If you mishandle this vase , it could be extremely dangerous , so please be careful .
That really should be destroyed ...
Someone will get bewitched .
Bang Shil ... fighting !
Scary things will come around ?
Bewitched ?
Bang Shil 's talking about herself , isn 't she ?
You got dragged into the Vice President 's office ?
It was a little scary .
What .. did she throw an envelope full of money at you ?
No ...
I saw a ghost .
I warned them but they couldn 't comprehend what I said .
Is that so ?
You !
People keep misunderstanding and say that you were rejected by the CEO .
I guess my advances are seen as being Candy to other people .
At times like this , only ghosts understand my story .
The marriage has been announced now ...
You 'll get rid of her , right ?
I have no intention of that .
I brought up marriage so that I can safely keep her .
You 're going to let her stay by your side ?
Is she refusing to leave ?
I 'm not letting her go .
Because I can 't not see her , for now , I 'm securing a safe distance with the marriage , and I 'm going to keep seeing her .
Until when ?
Until I don 't want to see her anymore .
Was she scared because of this ?
We told her it was extremely expensive , and she almost broke it in surprise .
She wouldn 't have been surprised that it was expensive ...
Is something attached to it ?
Joong Won !
Do you know how much this is ?
Because boasting about money won 't scare her , in the future , don 't do that .
He really !
CEO Joo ... fighting !
Big Tae Yang is dating the CEO of Kingdom ?
As if !
CEO Joo is marrying the daughter of Seo Jin Group .
Really ?
Mi Kyung , who works at Kingdom Hotel , says she saw them doing an event together .
He 's just playing her a bit .
Frankly , even playing around , their statuses are very incompatible .
Why ?
What 's wrong with big Tae Yang ?
She 's smart , pretty , good at sports , and has a good personality .
Honestly , was she the big Tae Yang for no reason ?
I thought that Kingdom 's CEO was someone who fits well with big Tae Yang .
You have to see her to come to your senses !
Do you want to meet her ?
Let 's pick a date .
You 're going to be surprised .
Are you alright ?
What did you see in the porcelain ?
Isn 't it that something scary followed you ?
It didn 't follow me .
But it 's something dangerous , so please warn them to be careful .
They didn 't seem to understand me .
Why didn 't you come to me ?
If you came to me because you needed me , I said I wouldn 't avoid you .
After telling me to leave the safety hideout as it is in the 2nd level basement in the sweet home , why didn 't you use it ?
Can I be honest ?
If you can , go ahead .
I was afraid the person I like would misunderstand .
Are you going to keep insisting that that person is Candy Kang ?
Are you going to keep misunderstanding it to be you ?
Misunderstanding ?
In a manwha movie I saw before , struck by lightning , I was a wolf who met a sheep .
In order for the wolf to live , it must eat the goat , But because she loved the sheep , she couldn 't eat and almost starved to death .
In order to survive , he should see it as something to eat , She 's not supposed to look at the sheep as someone she loves , so he 's kind of stupid , right ?
I won 't do that type of thing .
So , you 're saying that your " wolf " thinks of this " sheep " ... as a food source ?
Yes .
That 's why you shouldn 't keep asking if the wolf likes the goat .
Alright , then .
Let 's say the wolf was like that . What about the goat ?
In the movie , the goat also likes the wolf .
Then what happens ?
The goat likes the wolf so much that it says ,
" Wolf , just eat me . "
That goat must be crazy .
When the wolf likes the goat ... ♫ When my fingertip brushes you , ♫
But would the wolf eat the goat only because of that ?
♫ The warmth spreads to my icy heart . ♫
♫ I can 't even touch you . ♫
Don 't you want to know her secret ?
I don 't want to know .
Why ?
Are you afraid you can 't make calculations if you know ?
♫ Lonely Love . Yes , I love you . ♫
Yes .
Should I have listened so I can know for sure ... ?
Ah , I don 't know .
Don 't know .
The elder said that if his son is really getting married , he will adjust his schedule and return earlier .
About this wedding , what am I supposed to report ?
To tell you the truth , this wedding is fake .
It 's business for both sides .
If I accept your proposal , does the owner of Sejin Group change ?
I didn 't come here for a study , but on an exile .
Once I return to Korea with the marriage as an excuse , avoiding my step-mother 's control , I 'm going to find my bed-ridden father 's bank account under a different name .
I ... will turn Sejin Holding Company into Sejin Cement Corporation .
The excuse of marriage , will a week be enough ?
If you help me , I will help you expand Kingdom 's business in Shanghai by providing you with Sejin 's support . I will give you the wings so that you can fly .
That proposal ... I will accept it .
After one week , the wedding could become something that never happened .
Tell the Chairman that he doesn 't need to try too hard to change his schedule .
Does Tae Gong Shil know the truth ?
She doesn 't .
To her , before CEO Joong Won explains it , don 't mention it first .
I understand .
I prefer a simple white porcelain vase to a flashy celadon ( green-glazed ) vase .
It 's just like a dignified scholar .
Don 't just touch it recklessly .
She said it 's not good to touch it .
Just look at it .
That 's a ridiculous story .
Honey , what do you think you are doing ?
I mean what about it ?
No one 's around anyway .
What about me ?
I told you that I hate undignified people !
Go scratch in the bathroom .
I get it .
How did I fall for a man like that ?
When he wasn 't even my type .
I liked men who were like dignified scholars .
Who are you ?
A gentle , virtuous scholar like you is calling on me ?
When are you going to fix this annoying sleeping habit ?
I 've always been doing this , but why are you suddenly saying that now ?
Before ...
You told me it was cute that I sleep like a little kid .
Not being decent ...
Go sleep in another room !
I was meeting a noble scholar ( in my dream ) . Why that kick ?
Who did you meet ?
I 'm going to the VP 's office now .
Let 's go together .
No , I think it 's best for you to not come with me .
Is there a ghost ?
I saw something there .
That 's why I wanted to go to check on it .
So if you just give me the keys , I 'll just go by myself .
Let 's go together .
If I don 't check it well , I won 't be able to pass by the Vice President 's office anymore .
I 'll bring the keys .
Let 's go .
Are you going to stay here ?
Due to the business trip , there 's a lot of work piled up .
Secretary Kim you finished all your work , so you can go .
Yes .
Taeyang is still here , but should we go out together ?
No ...
I guess Kang Woo will probably take her .
He 's saying it so I could hear him , but I didn 't hear anything .
What is this ?
Did she already leave ?
Kang Woo ...
You can hold me if you 're scared .
Ok then ... I 'll lean on you .
I don 't want to hold on like a kid .
I am used to this posture .
Ok .
But please loosen your grip .
Alright ... I will .
Where should we look ?
The vase isn 't here .
No ghosts either .
They aren 't there ?
Tae Gong Shil , you aren 't scared ?
I 'm scared , too .
I 'm just more used to it than you .
Were you living in hiding for so long because you were scared ?
I was just living in hiding but ... after I met Mr. CEO it got a lot better .
My life started becoming different since I found a breathing space .
The CEO is ... giving you something that I could never give .
But he 's getting married now .
I don 't think I can keep staying by his side .
After a week , this could be something that never happened .
Miss Tae Gong Shil , why don 't you test yourself to see if you really need him or not ?
Even when he wasn 't here , you came to work and endured it well .
But , I don 't know if I 'll be able to not stick to him when he 's right next to me
Give yourself about a week , and please think about it well .
If you decide that you are fine without him , even if the situation changes ,
don 't go back to him .
It will hurt .
Wait for me and we 'll go together .
I heard there 's a nice ramyun shop near our building ...
There 's something there though .
Then , you direct me to a place without them .
The kimbap place next to it has nothing .
But it also has no taste ...
The kimbap place sounds better .
Hold it ...
Is Kang Woo not here ?
The Chief is out somewhere ...
We see you a lot .
Since I see you often , do I also look like a neighborhood girl to you ?
No you 're a goddess of course .
Appearing in our security office , a goddess .
What is that ?
It 's the Chief 's .
It 's cute ...
I 'm sorry , but a picture ?
If you keep doing this ... you won 't be able to go .
What is this ?
Kang Woo ...
You 're so cute !
Did you just do this because you were scared ?
Do it again .
That 's enough .
Why are you here again ?
There might be an article about you and me .
We got our photos taken in the subway .
I 'm meeting with a close reporter tomorrow ... If you come with me and have some beer , you can become a bodyguard .
And if I feel like it ... you 'll come out as my boyfriend .
That article will become number one .
I 'm going to the kimbap place with Tae Gong Shil later ...
You should come along and eat Korean yellow radish next to her since you 're friends .
Kang Woo !
It got on well .
Let 's go !
Let 's show Gong Shil , too .
This color ... and this color are the same .
Is that right ?
Let 's go next time to eat kimbap .
Yes , I understand .
I 'll go first then .
Mr. CEO didn 't leave yet ?
He 's not here ?
OH MY GOD !
I thought you were a ghost !
It would be better if I was a ghost . Without having to be worried about anyone else ... and being concerned for only yourself ...
If you were a ghost , you would have to hold on to me instead of me holding on to you .
I 'm really popular among the ghosts .
When they see me , I actually seem like the sun .
I 'm not even a ghost but why am I like this ?
What ?
Come in ...
Sit .
Tae Gong Shil , do you just want to be Candy ?
Come out of hostage , I 'll get you a house .
You might need a car , choose one .
Do you want to study more ?
Then do it .
I 'll let you .
Is there a big ghost that you need to find ?
Tae Gong Shil , normally people say either " Thank you . " or " Why are you being like this ? "
I don 't need a big house because then there 's a lot of room for ghosts to hide .
And for the car , I do have my license , but I 'm scared that something might come out so I don 't need it .
And I 'm thinking about studying , but I think I 'll be able to take a test even when there are ghosts .
You 're giving me answers that I can 't calculate at all .
The relationship that you and I have ...
I want to set things straight .
With no money and being frugal , you push away , and stick to a man with a lot of money . And people around you are telling you that it won 't work out .
If I buy you a house or a car , you either act cute or get upset . Do it the easy way .
You , who talk about ghosts in a porcelain vase when my aunt is trying to embarrass and insult you , you 're hard to understand .
Just be simple and be Candy .
Then I , for sure , can get rid of you .
If you 're curious about the end , I 'm not scared .
Then you 're saying that you can easily push me away ?
If I go into your world , and become your one and only person , if that happens , I can 't tell you to get lost .
So , to make it easier for me to deal with you , be Candy , and ... with me , let 's play in here .
If I become Candy , then that means I 'll have to leave when you tell me to get lost .
I don 't want to do it .
Then what do you want me to do ?
I tell you I 'm getting married , and you tell me to make a shelter for you at the B2 floor .
I tell you to be Candy , but you say you don 't want to accept gifts and leave in return .
You want me to become a sheep and expect me to say " Hunt me , and eat me "
I don 't expect anything like that .
Why is it so hard for you ?
Is it a burden that I might like you ?
I don 't like you .
Just like how we caught the water ghost at the hotel , I 'll just go catch the porcelain ghost .
There are none here .
Go home .
Let 's go .
Look at this .
After hearing all that , you don 't say " Why are you doing this " or " What do you think you 're doing "
Truthfully , on the way here , I saw a very scary ajumma .
Let 's go .
Where did you see her ?
At the entrance , I think it 's her first time here .
I guess I have to keep holding you hand .
If you 're uncomfortable , it 's okay if we just hold fingers .
While I was on my business trip , did you see any other scary things ?
There was .
But I endured by holding onto your ballpoint pen .
Pen ?
Oh , as an amulet .
Mr. CEO , I 've been thinking ... Since I was kind of okay , spending a week away from you with just that pen ... So when the time comes , before you tell me to get lost
So don 't worry too much .
There will be an end .
Necklace ...
I don 't think she picked it up .
Am I really that ... burdensome ?
Everyone , pay attention .
After China , it is America .
I 'll give you three minutes of time .
Those of you who can 't keep pace , go work for Giant mall .
Secretary Kim .
Keep an eye on Giant mall 's construction plan .
Make all of it into mirrors . Make it pretty . Everyone got it ?
I heard that girl and the CEO , together slept in a suite room .
A Suite room ?
They even borrowed the whole swimming pool .
Who ?
Over there .
But I heard she got dumped .
Because he 's marrying someone else .
Of course .
I knew it would happen .
I knew it was going to be like this .
But I 'm still kind of jealous .
What are you jealous of ?
Are they talking about me ?
Even I would marry someone else .
Seonbeenim ( scholar ) how can you have such good thoughts , and be so graceful ?
This is good .
Try it .
How vulgar and repulsive .
Why are you being like this again ?
You called me dirty earlier for going to the bathroom .
Why you keep hating everything I do ?
A man be such a flake .
I lost my appetite .
I knew Dooly , I guess there was a Gong Shil too ?
You seem tired these days , so for Gong Shil to have strength take Gong Shil .
Thank you .
She kind of looks like Dooly .
Gong Shil 's boyfriend is Dooly .
Really ?
Please take care of Gong Shil .
Okay , I 'll reserve the restaurant .
I 'll see you later .
Is this your office ?
It 's so tiny ,
I heard all our classmates from high school are having a gathering .
Everyone 's wondering about you .
Can 't you feel it ?
I 'll go .
I think I need to go to places like that .
Really ?
When we decide the place and time , I 'll let you know .
I 'm asking this because I 'm really curious , What 's your relationship with CEO Joo Joong Won ?
Just look at it as you see it .
I heard that you got rejected .
If it looked like that , I guess it is ...
That 's too bad .
CEO Joo Joong Won has been known for that first love curse ,
The wedding was broken several times , but I think this time he will actually marry .
Too bad the curse got broken just about the same time you tried to win him over .
I know right ..
What 's that ?
Gong Shil , her name is Gong Shil too .
Is this Dooly 's copycat ?
No , her boyfriend is Dooly .
Yes , I will go to the airport on time .
Okay .
I 'll see you then .
If I go in this time , I think I might be there for a long while .
Are you going to find this woman ?
If she 's alive , I need to find her .
Joo Woong , The saying that he 's under Cha Hee Joo 's curse , that rumor spread every time wedding was mentioned .
This time how it 's going to be , there will be a lot of talk going around .
To the CEO Cha Hee Joo isn 't a curse but a pain .
If it 's a pain , he supposed to look for someone to cure it .
Maybe it is a real curse ..
He kicks everyone out , not letting anyone near .
That 's right .
And he always goes " get lost "
A person who says he will not change , and a person who will not go away no matter how much you kick them away .
If they come together , who do you think will win ?
Are you talking about CEO and me ?
I 'm on your side .
I heard tomorrow you 're going to a class meeting .
Where 's the location ?
Tomorrow , the meeting with Sejin group Park Sung Ji has been planned .
It 's been almost a week , but are you sure you want to cancel it ?
Are you not planning to continue ?
I know everything about what Secretary Kim is thinking .
I 'm not going to tell you .
Honey .
Why is this person doing this to me lately ?
We have to break that though ...
Since this is President Joo 's fiance 's gift , leave this here .
Is aunt really wierd ?
After bringing this , she completely ignores me and when I tell her to do something , she says that she 's tired and can 't do it .
She even told me that she doesn 't want to see my face .
She 's not the type of person to do that though ...
According to that miss , if something happens , we should break this but even though things are weird , this isn 't something that should be broken just from listening to those words .
Tae Gong Sil said to break this ?
Yes she did .
But still ,
President Joo , you take responsibility for this .
After breaking this , I should say to take responsibility .
You said to break this .
Do I really have to ?
Is your aunt not feeling well ?
She 's in a really bad state .
She 's in a critical state and can 't even get up .
Then do I break this or not ?
Then you 're supposed to break it ...
If this breaks , you know that the wedding gets cancelled too , right ?
Do I break it or not ?
You can 't really break those things though ...
They said aunt is in a very bad state ... that she 's almost dying .
She 's the only aunt I have though ...
Then you have to break it ...
Then it 's decided .
We 're trusting your words and breaking this .
If the wedding breaks too , then you take responsibility .
Why do I have to take responsibility for that ?
Because of you , she 's dying so we break it .
No !
Honey !
Honey !
What ?
What ?
What 's wrong ?
Are you okay ?
Are you okay ?
What was that ?
What was that ? !
I don 't see anything .
Gong Sil , you said to break it for the ghost but why was the reason changed to breaking the wedding ?
For you , it wasn 't like that , right ?
To others , how they might see you next to him , I think I understand now .
What do I do ?
Kang Woo ssi .
Is there something there ?
It was Gong Sil to Gong Sil talking .
It 's been almost a week .
How do you feel ?
Even though that person isn 't here , do you think you 'll be okay ?
I 'm not sure if it 's okay for him to be gone , but I now understand what it 's like to be next to him .
Gong Sil , when both are together does it match well .
You said that you had a gathering today , right ?
Sumo said that you were very nervous .
That 's right .
It 's been a really long time since I met my friends .
When girls meet together , they brag a lot about their boyfriends , right ?
I guess so .
Then , Tae Gong Sil , you should also brag about your man .
Who ?
Dooly ?
At that spot , if Dooly shows up , all girls faint .
But rather than Dooly , I think liked Dochi more .
That won 't do then .
If you want to talk about Dooly , then he should be there too .
You 're going to the airport to escort the president , right ?
Yes .
Then do you have an appointment ?
Oh , with Tae Yang ?
Yes .
Lee Hyun Joo has a loud mouth so you should tell her that Gong Sil and the president aren 't in that type of relationship .
Who makes those rumors anyway ?
I agree .
I don 't understand why people go around saying whatever they want nowadays .
Listening to some people , it seems like it was someone from the security team .
Really ?
But does our security team have someone with that kind of cheap mouth ?
You should figure it out , so I can give them my wrath .
When you figure it out , I won 't ask for money for coffee .
Eat this .
Lee Hyun Joo is right here .
After lunch finishes , he said to come to the vice president 's room .
Why would the vice president look for you ?
I wonder too ...
I wonder why .
Then go and found out who has the cheap mouth .
Then I 'll be going .
This is takeout .
Honey .
What again ?
It sounds so powerful how you suck those noodles right in !
I fell for those sexy lips .
You must have gone crazy !
According to that miss , breaking that vase must really have had an effect .
But why did Joong Won break that fiance 's really important gift ?
I wonder .
Maybe he was thinking of breaking up the wedding ...
Honey .
You said that hyungnim is coming in today , right ?
It 's been a year already .
He couldn 't be coming to help Joong Won 's wedding .
Maybe there 's some other issue ?
Kang Woo , it 's been a long time .
Let 's go .
Thanks to you , the problem 's been solved .
If Kingdom 's side doesn 't mind , I want to continue this marriage .
It 's unfortunate that we must stop here .
It 's nothing to be unfortunate about .
It started out as a business deal , and we 've gained a lot .
We should both calculate how big that is .
Yes it 's been a long time .
I come by a lot .
Oh , big Tae Yang !
Wow , it 's been a really long time !
Hi !
Come here .
Are you okay ?
What 's wrong ?
No !
No , it 's nothing .
I 'm okay .
Anyway , since we cancelled the wedding , I can 't say let 's see each other often .
If it 's like this , then have I become President Joo 's cursed love ?
It 's famous .
Kingdom 's Joo President is stuck on a cursed dead first love .
It 's been your fourth breakup ( wedding cancelled ) , right ?
I hope you get free from your curse next time .
That girl said that she was the fourth curse .
If we gather all the cursed women and play go stop , we could sell Kwangdo .
Even though we gather them , it won 't be fun . They all are pushed out by a dead girl .
A heart that no one accepts is cursed .
If it doesn 't change , then it won 't be freed either .
The reason why I kept you close to Joong Won is because of this piece of photograph .
This is Maria .
I accidentally found this picture in Maria 's old photo album .
Who do you think this other woman is ?
That 's Cha Hee Joo .
Where is this place ?
England ?
Yes .
A woman who doesn 't just resemble but looks exactly the same was in England .
One year after Cha Hee Joo died .
Then , are you saying Cha Hee Joo is alive ?
You said Joong Won met the dead Cha Hee Joo through the woman named Tae Gong Shil , right ?
I found the living Cha Hee Joo in Europe .
Then , could Cha Hee Joo have been one of the twins ?
That 's the most possible scenario .
But I found something very strange .
What are these ?
Those are the x-mas cards which the English person who took this picture exchanged these X-mas cards for 10 years .
She lived traveling many different places overseas .
Looking at the sent date sequence , she lived 3 years in LA , 4 years in New York , and 3 years in Peking .
My son stayed abroad after the kidnapping incident .
3 years in LA , 4 years in New York , 3 years in Peking .
Did this woman follow around CEO Joo Joong Won ?
The last postcard had a message that she 's returning to Korea .
That was 5 years ago , and after that , Joong Won came back to Korea and he 's been living here since .
Do you think this woman is somewhere near CEO Joo Joong Won ?
Yes .
I believe that Cha Hee Joo is alive , and she followed Joong Won after that incident , and she 's still some place very close .
Who is she ?
I haven 't seen her around .
She moved here not too long ago .
It 's Tae Gong Shil .
Ah ...
She said she was going to a school reunion .
I guess it was here .
I heard your father just checked in the hotel .
Chief Kang Woo will be here soon .
Will you see him and listen to what he says ?
I will talk to my father in person .
You don 't need to call Chief Kang Woo .
I didn 't call him .
Rather , he 's coming here to see Tae Yang .
I guess he 's going to join them .
Wow ...
Tae Yang ... will be pretty proud in front of her high school friends today .
Her boyfriend is so tall and good looking ...
So you had an accident ...
How about now , are you okay ?
Yes .
I 've gotten much better .
But ... it 's such a waste that you didn 't get to graduate from that college , that school background .
Until what age can you go back to your study ?
There 's still time , but ...
Gong Shil !
Tell me about you .
You said you 're working at Kingdom , right ?
You ...
The CEO there ... is he really your boyfriend ?
Tell them in detail what you told me .
How you made advances to him , and how you got rejected .
You 're right .
I met a man who 's really rich and successful .
How ?
On a heavy raining day , I got a ride in a very nice car .
But the person was Kingdom 's CEO .
I really wanted to see him again , so I went to visit him .
I felt like I had to hold on to him . So , I got a part-time job there , and followed him around .
When I told him I was alone and sad , he started looking at me .
The safety hideout came .
Hide .
Whenever I was going through a hard time , he helped me , and stayed with me .
Ah , he even held an event for me by renting the whole hotel pool .
How do you see me after hearing my story ?
Hey , we 're so jealous !
I envy you .
And then what ?
You know the ending is what 's important .
That person is marrying a chaebol 's daughter soon .
No wonder ...
Still , I haven 't gotten off of him , and I still hold on to him tightly .
Because I can never be separated from him .
That 's a little ...
I can 't help it ever though I look shameless and pathetic .
Because , to me , he 's the only one special person in the world .
That 's me .
Tae Gong Shil .
I came here after breaking off the marriage because of you .
So , you take the responsibility .
Let 's go .
What are you doing here ?
Now you 're doing what I wanted to see from you .
Then , is it my turn to act all charming ?
My kid is pretty upset .
To appease her , I 'll treat you to this dinner .
Please have a fun and enjoyable time here .
My baby . Will you come with Oppa ?
Let 's go .
What the heck do they think they 're doing ?
Without the talks of radar and the safety hideout , people understand ( the relationship between ) you and me easily .
Stop it .
I get it now .
This is me in your world .
Tae Gong Shil !
What 's wrong ?
What 's wrong ?
Did something happen ?
I was taking her with me .
Kang Woo !
What 's the matter ?
Why is Tae Gong Shil acting that way ?
Why did CEO Joo come here ?
He said that he broke off the marriage because of her .
And told her to take the responsibility .
What about you ?
Why are you here ?
Did you come here because of her , too ?
Yes .
Do you really like Tae Gong Shil ?
Yes .
With this , you won 't ever tell me to become your boyfriend again , right ?
You said you would make the whole thing available and to use everything .
I just need a small space to breathe in .
But are you that afraid that I would want something else ?
Yes , I am .
Can you really protect me without other thoughts ?
After protecting me while looking at me strictly as a marble safety hideout , once you think you can live again , can you get lost on your own ?
I told you I would .
I 'm like that even now .
Can I trust that ?
Even though you just stomped me so horribly , if a scary thing suddenly pops out , I can immediately run straight into your arms .
I 'm like that .
It 's not like you don 't know that .
Fine . I 'll trust you .
From now on , I 'm going to do whatever I want to do to make myself at ease .
From now on , you handle everything .
Thank you .
I can handle everything .
Is that right ?
Then , start with handling this .
Tae Yang .
I think I love you .
What will you do now ?
Ms. Tae . I think ... that I 'm in love with you .
What are you going to do about it ?
First , you were planning to get married ... then you wanted me to be your candy girl ... and now , you 're saying that you love me ? Are you teasing me right now ?
I broke off an expensive engagement .
Then , I put on a goosebumps inducing cute act just to get you out of there . But , all you think this is me teasing you ?
Why are you being like this ?
You 're frightening me .
When you first ran over to me because you saw a ghost ... I thought that you were joking , and I was scared too at the same time .
I understand what you 're feeling right now .
But , I 've now accepted it .
So , you need to accept it too .
If I accept it ... will it change anything ?
You don 't seem to be getting this at all . So , let me give you an example .
From now on , if you ask me to hold your hand and sleep with you ... I will enjoy it with open arms .
Are you acting like this on purpose so that I won 't touch you anymore ?
The reason why I keep touching you doesn 't have anything at all to do with enjoyment .
You know that I have no choice but to touch you out of necessity .
I know that you have your definite reasons , but I no longer have a reason .
I kept wondering why I let you stick around even when things didn 't add up . But it was ... because I like you .
I tried putting up a wall between us by setting up that engagement so that I don 't wield you around like I really want to .
I even tried to calculate you out and turn you into my candy girl . But you told me you didn 't want that .
I did everything that I could think of . Now , I 'm just going to do whatever I want .
Remaining unyielding and staying strong is your responsibility from now on .
You take care of it .
I just don 't understand this .
If you like me , then shouldn 't you be telling me to fall for you ?
Does this look like I 'm making a sweet confession of love to you ?
I 'm giving you a flat out warning not to fall for me no matter how I try to seduce you .
If you don 't want me to fall for you , then you shouldn 't be seducing me ! Hang on a second .
I 'm having a serious conversation right now .
Come back later .
So you 're telling me right now ... that you like me , but I shouldn 't like you ?
Just a minute !
I 'm trying to have a serious conversation over here ! What ?
I don 't have time to do that right now !
I missed you the whole time I was gone . I was worried , too .
I felt pathetic for checking my phone all the time in case you called so I turned my phone off instead , and didn 't take any phone calls .
What am I to do when you 're doing this to me ?
This is the type of stuff that I 'm telling you to handle .
I have faith in you .
I feel so much better now that I 've gotten all that off my chest .
Let 's go .
Tae Gong Shil said ... President Joo Joong Won ... is a very special person to her ... unlike anyone else in this world .
That 's what she said .
President Joo broke off his engagement and came to get her .
There 's no room for you there . I guess you 're right .
Now that you know , you can 't continue to have feelings for her anymore .
That 's something for me to handle .
But now that you know ... you shouldn 't follow me around anymore .
I didn 't pay much attention because I thought you were hanging about out of boredom . But if you 're serious ... then stop .
I 'm not being serious .
I don 't even do serious documentaries or dramas . I usually stick to lighter stuff .
Following you around was like filming the variety show , ' Running Man ' .
I 'm not stopping because you told me to stop .
That 's a relief .
Didn 't you say that your friends were inside ? You should get back in there .
Even Yoo Jae Suk thanked me for appearing on his show and asked me to return . So , who is he to tell me to stop ?
Do you think that you became attracted to me because of the physical contact ?
I wouldn 't be coming after you just because I 'm a little attracted .
In any case ...
I guess I did fall for some sort of desire you stirred up in me .
Then ... are we on a date right now since we are walking hand in hand like this ?
Is there anywhere that you 'd like to go ?
There are a lot of places that I 'd want to go but it 's already dark out . So , it 's a little scary . But ... as long as I hold onto your hand , I guess we can go anywhere .
That 's the kind of man I am to you .
If I walk around holding your hand like this ... then I can go into night markets , or the movie theater ... and I can even go and see the night skyline .
I remember going to see the night skyline in the past there was a lot ghosts floating outside the window that followed me there . So , I had to leave without seeing any of the scenery .
If you like being up high , then should we fly up in my plane ... so that you could fly into the sky .
Will you come with me to anywhere I want to go ?
I 'll stay with you right by your side for the night . Since I 'll be the one enjoying it .
Hang on . Then where should we go ?
Should we go to Namdaemun ? No , how about Dongdaemun ?
Should we go to the seashore ?
I don 't know what to do .
Hang on a second .
Yes , Chief Secretary Kim . Yes .
Yes , I understand .
- President Joo , I 've decided .
- Tae Gong Shil .
Just follow me for tonight .
- Where ?
- It 's probably ... going to be a setting where the richest people of this country will be gathering .
But first ... we need to get you some clothes .
Something black and elegant .
The chairman of Giant Group just passed away .
His son is the president of Giant Mall .
You didn 't have to tell you love me if you just needed me to come here .
It was just really bad timing .
I don 't believe you .
I 'll just go turn on my radar .
Chairman Lee Yong Jae of the Giant Group lost his battle with his illness earlier today . He passed away at his vacation villa in Chungpyung .
Following the wishes of the late Chairman Lee Yong Jae only a small funeral will be held with his closest family members and friends .
Towards the end , he left everything to his wife and son and he spent his last days at the villa with his hired help .
That man was known for his quiet life and his devotion to his family ... but betrayed his entire family in the worst way possible in the end .
Everyone is looking nervous because they fear that woman would show up .
His son ... the President of Giant Mall . He must 've been really shocked , he hasn 't shed a single tear .
That man over there is the President of Giant Mall .
Wow .
What is it ?
Did you see something ?
He 's so handsome .
With all the badmouthing you did I thought that he 'd look really mean and vulgar .
But he 's so dashing .
We 're in the middle of our date . How dare you look at another man .
Turn on your radar and find the ghost .
Don 't touch me while I have my radar on .
You know that my radar charges a rate per job , right ?
Make sure you pay up when I find you that rich ghost .
President Joo . - Long time no see .
- Yes , hello .
Is she with you ?
- She 's my girlfriend .
- Oh , really ?
Bring her with you to our next company event .
Yes , I understand .
What are you doing ?
Why are you calling me your girlfriend to all your rich friends ?
If I don 't say the same thing to my friends that I did for your friends you 'll be upset .
Are you picking up anything ?
No , nothing yet .
I 'll go see what I can find .
I 'm trying to handle it , but it 's still getting to me .
Chairman .
I met him .
Met who ?
The man in that picture . That 's the chairman , right ?
Yes , it is .
He asked me to do something for him .
Sit down and get some rest , Mother .
He says there 's something that his son can never find out about . He wants me to get rid of it for him .
Father !
Father !
Father !
You 've kept it hidden your whole life ... but you ultimately got caught in the end .
The last person that the chairman was with ... was a woman that he has spent his whole life to keep hidden .
He wants to get rid of all her stuff .
I don 't want to get involved in his messy personal business .
It would 've been nice if he had told you some big business secret or something .
I noticed that the president of Giant Mall didn 't even shed a single tear , and he didn 't look like he was doing so well .
I think it was really traumatic for him to lose his father like he did .
He 's not the only one who have lost his father like that .
If that mystery woman makes an appearance I 'm sure that 'll cause some problems with the inheritance .
I want that woman to come on the scene and drop a huge bomb on the Giant Mall president 's face . So , pretend not to know anything , and just leave it alone .
He looked like a nice person , and we have to stop any bombs from exploding in his face .
Who 's side are you on ?
Let 's leave together tomorrow afternoon .
Since it takes about two hours to get to the vacation villa in Chungpyung we should be able to be back before the sun goes down .
- My vacation villa is in Yangpyung .
- Are you bragging right now ?
Chairman told me that his vacation villa is in Chungpyung .
I have no intentions of going with you to Chungpyung to help him .
But if you want to enjoy yourself , we can get on the road right now to Yangpyung .
Yangpyung ? That 's a really nice place , isn 't it ?
Enjoy what ?
Forget it .
Don 't worry , Tae Gong Shil .
I can go there just to sleep with your hand held in mine .
I 've put all my faith in you , but if you can 't put your faith in me then that would be very disappointing to me .
Where do you think you 're going ?
- I can 't go with you to Yangpyung .
- We 're not going there .
We 're just going back to our own separate homes .
Just what are you thinking of ?
I 'll take you home .
Why are you toying with me like this ?
Are you teasing me ?
I 'm just going along with your ghost ventures .
You and I are from two different neighborhoods and it 's not like your ghost ventures are any fun either .
But , since I like you ... I just want to go along with you on your ghost ventures ..
When you 're no longer afraid of all these ghosts ... and when you feel that you 'll be able to handle them on your own ... then tell me to stop .
And I 'll go back to my own neighborhood .
You told me there would be an end to this , didn 't you ? That too is your responsibility .
Yes , I should do that .
I need to end it nicely one of these days .
Let 's not become like that wolf and the lamb from that story .
What happened to them at the end ?
There 's a fairytale version of that story .
Read it if you are ever able to .
Are you disrespecting me right now because I can 't read a children 's book ?
If that 's how you 're going to play it , then we 're going to Yangpyung right now .
Then go ahead if you want to go .
I have no intentions of just holding your hand and going to sleep .
You told me to have fun with you and send you back when I 'm done , didn 't you ?
I heard you loud and clear .
But for now ... just take me back to my house .
Since this is a funeral home , a ghost might follow me back home .
Okay .
But , you never know .
Joong Won broke off his engagement again .
I was feeling nervous about it . I had hoped to have the wedding while you were here . But out of the blue , he called off the wedding .
How many times has he done this now ?
Is it three ... or four ?
This is the fourth one .
I guess we 'll be hearing about Joong Won 's curse again .
Do you think that Joong Won is acting like this because of that girl , Cha Hee Joo ?
I 'm positive that 's not the reason this time .
There 's a girl named Bang Shil .
It 's not Bang Shil , but it 's Tae Gong Shil . Tae Gong Shil .
Tae Gong Shil has a special ability to see dead people and she claims that she saw Cha Hee Joo 's ghost .
That prickly son of mine ... believes that nonsense of a story ?
Yes , and because of that ...
I don 't think he 'll believe that this is a picture of living Cha Hee Joo .
What do you think , Kang Woo ?
Since you 've kept close to her , and have been keeping an eye on her ?
I too ... believe what Tae Gong Shil claims .
Tae Gong Shil .
Drive home safe .
That wolf and lamb story you mentioned .
- What 's that story called ?
- The title of that book ?
There 's an animated version of that story . You should just watch that instead .
It 's just that the book has a rather sad ending .
- You can 't read books anyways .
- I 'm not going to ask you to read it to me .
President Joo , I 've been giving it some thought ... at first , I was offended to hear you say that I 'm a play thing or a sort of entertainment ... but when I tell people my ghost stories they tell me that they think that I sound ominous and I 'm a bad omen . So , I think what you 're saying is better than that .
So , let 's remain friendly and enjoy our time together .
Drive home safely .
Okay .
Let 's remain friendly , and have some fun ... and the wolf will go back to the wolf 's house , and the lamb will go back to the lamb 's . Just as they should .
Okay , this is the way it should be .
Filled to the brim like this .
So who 's been emptying it every day ? - It 's so strange .
- Tae Gong Shil .
Kang Woo .
You seemed upset when you left earlier . Are you okay now ?
Why are you dressed like that ?
Did you go to a funeral ?
Yes .
You can call it my spy outfit of sorts .
Did President Joo Joong Won take you there and use you for his benefit ?
Excuse me ?
President Joo said that he 's keeping you by his side to use you for his own good .
Is what he said ... true ?
It is true that he is using me . But we 've also decided to remain friends and have some fun with each other .
I heard that he broke off his engagement , and that you were the cause of it .
Is he telling you that you 're the only one for him now ?
Kang Woo . You once told me that when you 're not being honest with your heart the pain you feel is your answer , right ?
He 's telling me that he 's being honest with his heart . But the pain ... I think is my burden to bear .
Go on up .
You look uncomfortable in that dress .
I 'll take care of this down here .
Kang Woo , were you the one emptying out these can ?
I guess I should be honest with you on this one .
Yes , I 've been doing it .
Every single time ?
I ... owe you a big apology .
Since I told you that I liked you .
Then , let 's do it together .
Tae Gong Shil .
Did ... you really see Cha Hee Joo 's ghost ?
Yes .
What kind of reckless driving is that ?
You must 've been startled .
I 'm so sorry .
If you drive out so suddenly like that ...
are you okay ?
I 'm so sorry .
I recently moved here from England and I 'm not used to driving on the opposite side of the road .
- Are you okay ?
- Yes , I 'm okay .
I 've seen around before .
You 're from England , you say ?
Yes .
I 've seen the two of you going for walks around here a few times myself .
You looked like nice neighbors , and I 've been meaning to introduce myself .
Why don 't we get together for some tea sometime soon ?
Yes , I 'd like that .
Joo Joong Won 's aunt ... That 's her , right ?
I 've never ... been in this room before .
We should probably clean up in here before his son comes to visit , right ?
Have you ever met the chairman 's girlfriend ?
I 've noticed a faint trace of a woman 's perfume on the chairman once in awhile but I never knew that he 'd sneak her in here to have a secret rendezvous .
Don 't touch that !
Why does it feel so chilly in here all of a sudden ?
I bet ... the late chairman doesn 't want us touching his things .
Let 's just leave everything the way it is until his son comes to clean it up himself .
It hasn 't even been that long since the funeral of the chairman but some questions have been raised about him dying ... in the arms of his secret lover .
I guess that 'll give the president of Giant Mall some trouble .
He 'll be here soon to discuss the logistics of Kingdom 's parking ramp entrance .
- Okay , I understand .
- And Ms. Tae ... Ms. Tae seems to want to meet him as well .
I haven 't seen the Chairman since the funeral .. I thought that maybe , I 'd see him hanging around his son .
Are you now starting to seek out these ghosts on your own ?
Aren 't you afraid ?
He wasn 't scary looking at all . If anything , he looked kind of sad .
When I saw him at the funeral , I smelled a very strong scent coming from him .
It smelled like perfume , so I 'm looking to see if I can find the scent . And this is the perfume .
The scent of the woman that the chairman is longing for .
Do you think it 's possible that if I smelled like this scent then he may come to talk to me again ?
Are you ... attempting to lure in a ghost now ?
I told you that I 'm pretty popular amongst ghosts even if I don 't try to lure them in .
Right ?
Are you by any chance ... having tea time with your ghost friends right now ?
There 's a kid here who really likes his coffee . But he brought a friend today .
Is it by any chance ... the trash can man ?
No , he never moves from his spot .
- He doesn 't really talk to me either .
You mentioned that you 're not really friends with that ghost .
Did she find it and not wear it ...
or maybe she never got it ?
Maybe she was offended because I threw the necklace away for her to find .
Giant Mall 's president should soon be here .
It 's time for you to go to the conference room .
- Yes , okay .
- Are you bothered by something ?
I should no longer feel bothered now that I 've let everything out in the open ... but it continues to weigh on me .
Are you referring to the issue you 're having with the parking ramp entrance ?
No , forget it .
Chief Secretary Kim . - I need you to find me a book .
- A book ?
Are you thinking of ... trying to read a book on your own ?
President Joo , when are you going to visit your father ?
He 's staying at the Kingdom Hotel .
I 'm always at Kingdom , so tell him that he can come see me at any time .
You know very well that he 's not someone who 'd come to you first and give you an explanation .
He should know that I 'm also not someone who will go to see him first and give any sort of an explanation .
The two of you are so alike , I guess you guys won 't be meeting this time either .
Chief Secretary Kim .
Here comes the president of Giant Mall .
It 's the chairman 's son .
Excuse me a moment .
The Giant Mall president has laid eyes on Ms. Tae .
He 's initiating a conversation with her .
That 's a very unique scent .
What 's the name of the perfume are you wearing ?
Um ... I don 't really remember the name of the perfume . But I can show you the bottle .
Please do .
Then follow me .
Those two are heading off somewhere together .
That 's not the direction of the conference room .
I think they 're going to Tae Gong Shil 's office .
Why is Giant Mall 's president following a woman that he 's only met once ?
Do you think that she told him that he has something by his side ?
I 'm sure there is something there .
She told me that it made a request for her to go somewhere .
And where is that place ?
Giant Mall chairman 's vacation villa in Chungpyung .
Ah , so she must 've been wondering where in Chungpyung the villa was located . That must be the reason why she wants to meet the president of Giant Mall .
Then I guess those two will be driving up there together .
It 's not like Giant Mall 's president is married or anything . I 'm sure that he 's feeling a lonely since the recent death of his father .
I bet Ms. Tae will be a great comfort to him .
Chungpyung .
That 's a wonderful place to heal one 's soul under the warmth of the bright sun .
Isn 't it your role ... to follow her when things like this happens , President Joo ?
You can 't just let them go off on their own , can you ?
I really didn 't want to go because it 's too bothersome . But I guess I have no other choice but to go there myself .
It 's this bottle .
It 's the same scent .
It 's the same scent that you used to smell on the chairman , isn 't it ?
Did you know my father ?
I 've only met him once .
By any chance ... are you the one ?
My mother never wore any perfume .
Although I have smelled a woman 's perfume on my father once in a while ... but I still trusted my father .
It 's not me .
That 's a relief .
I would 've despised my father even more if she had been such a young woman .
He really hates his father .
I forgot to ask him where the villa is in Chungpyung !
Tae Gong Shil , let 's go to Chungpyung .
I 'll go with you .
You said you don 't want to go because you wanted to throw a bomb in his face .
No , I 've met the Chairman a few times myself . So , I have to help him keep his secret hidden .
Let 's go .
What is it that you wanted to see me about this time ?
The rumor of Tae Gong Shil 's relationship with President Joo is spreading all over the place thanks to you and your loose mouth .
But this time , it 's not your mouth that I need but it 's your ears .
My ears ?
What is it that you need to hear ?
Tae Gong Shil attended Hankuk University , but she never graduated .
She got into a big accident , so she had to drop out before graduating .
And we know that 's why she 's the way she is now .
I need you to find out the details of that accident .
Why do you need to know that ?
It seems like President Joo has fallen completely head over heels for her . If she 's been seriously injured from the accident then I don 't know if she 's someone whom Joong Won should marry .
That 's why I want to find out more about it .
I feel a bit guilty about this now that we 've gotten a little close .
Who 's the blabbermouth working for the Vice President ?
I don 't think it 's anyone from the security team .
- I think it 's someone from the PR Team .
- Really ? But I did hear a rumor that the blabbermouth is looking into Gong Shil 's past .
What about my Gong Shil 's past ?
I heard that she got into an accident ? When did that happen ?
- It happened seven years ago .
- Seven years ... that was a long time ago .
But it 's only been four years since she left the hospital .
She was in the hospital for three years .
It must 've been a bad accident .
What was it ...
a car accident ? Ugh , my heart still feels like it 's going to jump right out of my chest whenever I still think about that accident .
I really don 't want to talk about it .
It must 've been really difficult for you .
How about we grab some dinner together tonight ?
Dinner ?
Since you seem to be so upset by this , I thought I 'd treat you to a nice dinner .
Should we ?
I love going out to nice dinners .
Okay .
Okay then .
Yes , thanks for the coffee .
She 's so gullible that I think a little alcohol would get her to start talking . But why do I feel so guilty about doing that to her ?
I need to get my head on straight .
The president of Giant Mall was preoccupied by other thoughts during the whole meeting .
But thanks to that , the parking garage problem is going to end up being more advantageous on our side .
I think that he feels really betrayed by his father .
- He says he feels really betrayed .
- If he had been trained at a young age ... then he 'd be able to ignore that just fine .
Do you not ...
like your father very much either ?
We don 't really like each other .
Anyways ... is it okay for us to just barge into his villa ?
I don 't really want to go back to jail for breaking and entering .
Since he asked me to go , I bet the chairman would be waiting for us when we get there .
I 'm sure he 'll show us in .
This is the room .
He 's sitting right over there .
Please excuse our brief intrusion .
Okay , he wants us to delete the photos of the woman in the camera .
He doesn 't want anyone seeing these pictures .
Forget it . I don 't want to see it either .
Let 's just delete them quickly and get out of here .
Okay .
Did you take these pictures yourself ?
All the pictures are so pretty .
We didn 't clean the room , and left the room just as it is .
I 'll take care of cleaning up the stuff in this room .
I 'm going to burn everything in this room , so start a big fire for me .
Yes , Sir .
There aren 't any other exits , or any room for us to hide .
I have to delete these photos .
You can 't delete them now .
We have to use the photos to explain what we 're doing here if we get caught .
He asked me to make sure that his son never sees these photos .
We have to show them to his son so that we can get ourselves out of here .
Yes ?
This is Kingdom 's president Joo Joong Won .
President Joo Joong Won ?
The parking entrance agreement that we negotiated today seems to favor my mall heavily , so I 'm calling you about it right now .
We actually were thinking that we made a mistake after the meeting was over .
So , I appreciate you calling me like this .
Let 's renegotiate the deal . We 'll take your position into consideration .
Come back to our Kingdom office immediately .
I 'm out in Chungpyung at the moment .
You have to come immediately . Come immediately before I change my mind .
Yes , I 'll do that .
I 'll be right there .
He 's gone .
Of course , he is .
You probably can 't even fathom how much money I just gave up .
I think the Chairman appreciates for what you just did .
Hand it over . I 'll delete them .
I told you that can 't allow anyone to see it .
Then do it quickly .
I don 't want to see it either .
But that chairman ... only cares about keeping that woman hidden . I guess he doesn 't care about his son 's feeling .
A businessman so preoccupied by grief , he almost let an important business deal like that slip out of his grasp .
Rather than keeping his woman hidden when he met you ... shouldn 't he be asking you to go to his son and apologize for him ? Shouldn 't he feel bad for what he 's done ?
If this is ... how he was going to end it ... then he should 've made sure to prepare his son for this kind of situation .
But he was so firm about keeping his secret yet all he did was drop the biggest bomb on his son before he died .
This must be the woman .
Is this the woman ?
Okay , then . Hurry up and delete them , and let 's go .
President Joo .
The chairman would like for me to show you these pictures .
Tell him I don 't want to see them .
No , you should .
He wants to know what you think his son would feel if he saw these pictures .
He wants you to take a look , and give him your opinion .
He 's asking me ?
I 've already been trained by my father about keeping all sorts of women so I don 't think it 's really going to faze me at all .
Lies .
Yes , President Joo .
I 'm on my way right now .
Turn around and come back .
I 'm at your villa in Chungpyung right now ... in the room where your father passed away .
Excuse me ?
What are you two doing in here ?
You .
You told me that it wasn 't you , but it was you after all ?
Are you my father 's woman ?
Get yourself straight .
She 's mine .
The woman your father was trying to keep hidden ... is right here .
Are you trying to use this picture ... to threaten me right now ?
Then ... take your Giant Mall and get out of my Kingdom 's sight .
Is it possible for you not to open your mall ?
Whatever it is that my father left behind ... that 's my father 's problem .
I 'm sure that it may be a bit of a shock I 'm never going to let that shake my resolve or make me crumble .
Even though I may hate my own father ... I will never allow anyone else to wag their fingers at him .
Then ... take a look .
Chairman .
Rather than trying to protect your son ... I think it would be better ... to let your son protect you .
This is the only picture of her that 's left in this world .
This is the woman that your father has spent his whole life kept hidden away .
He says ... that 's the woman that he kept secret from everyone .
There were so many things that he needed protect ... so he said he had to keep his secret hidden his entire life .
The perfume that you smelled on your father once a while ... was probably the scent of his true self .
He wanted to take one final picture of that woman before he passed away .
He said he wanted to have a private funeral for her on his own but he unexpectedly collapsed .
He said that you 'd be disgusted by him if you found out the truth ... and that 's why he wanted to hide the truth .
Everything that my father spent his whole life protecting ... I have to continue protecting them .
As for a funeral for this poor woman ... her son will hold one for her .
My father is flying back out tomorrow morning ?
He still has no inclination to come see me before he leaves ?
I 've been told that he is expecting you to come see him .
Seeing how he hasn 't come by ... to give me an explanation about the necklace 's whereabouts ... Do you think that 's because he stole the necklace and has it in his own possession ?
Or it 's possible that he knows something , and he 's just trying to protect his son .
Team Leader Kang told me that he told your father about Tae Gong Shil .
Your father is concerned that she 's got you fooled with some nonsense and that she may end up taking advantage of you somehow .
If you don 't go and talk to him yourself , he may have Team Leader Kang ... bring Ms. Tae in so that he could meet her for himself .
What is Giant Mall 's president doing back here ?
I told him that I wasn 't going to renegotiate our business deal .
Seeing how he 's here with that big bouquet of flowers I don 't think it 's you that he 's here to see .
Once a person feels the warmth of the sun , they always want more .
That 's a huge bouquet of flowers that he 's holding in his hands .
Doesn 't he have anything better to do ?
He could 've just had it delivered .
It 's much better to give the flowers in person .
That way he can make sure for himself that she receives the flowers .
Tell me for sure ... whether she got the necklace or not .
If she took the necklace ... then flip over that lid ... for me .
So , she did get the necklace .
That 's good .
Did she like the necklace ?
She must 've not really liked it .
She liked it that much ?
If I had given it to her directly ... I could 've seen for myself how much she liked it .
But I told myself that I wasn 't going to do that . No , I won 't do it .
Ms. Tae is a very special person to President Joo .
Is there a reason why Ms. Tae must stay here at Kingdom ?
Yes .
Because she 's Master Joo 's sun .
I will make sure to relay your gratefulness to her .
I 'm disappointed to hear that .
Please relay a message to President Joo for me . Tell him that I have a telescope , too .
Here , have some of this too .
Yes .
Deputy Kim and Manager Park in the PR Department ?
Ah , I see .
So , I just need to clear up the misunderstanding ? Okay .
Excuse me ?
The thing that the parking attendant , Mr. Kim lost ? Where was it again ?
Oh ... in the parking garage ?
Behind the shopping cart ?
Okay , I got it .
Yes , I 'll find it for him .
And what else ?
Wait ! Don 't jump out and scare me like that !
If you act like this , I 'm not going to talk to you guys anymore and call in President Joo .
You all know what happens when I touch him , don 't you ?
Ms. Tae Gong Shil doesn 't really visit President Joo 's office these days .
That 's a relief to hear .
- Are you here to shop ?
- Yes . You as well ?
My nephew is the president here , and my husband is the vice president .
Ah ... I see .
You 're not married , are you ?
- No , I 've always been too focused on work .
- I see . Why don 't you come over to my house for dinner sometime ?
My nephew lives in the same building .
Yes , thank you for the invitation .
She 's not bad .
I forgot to ask her for her name .
Long time no see ... Joo Joong Won .
President Joo is here to see you .
I 'm here .
I didn 't think that you 'd come .
I came because I 'm confident that nothing you have to say will faze me .
If you want to hear what I have to say , you need to start talking first .
Okay , fine .
Hee Joo was one of the culprits .
I was completely deceived by her . I told her all about my mother 's necklace as well .
I swear to you that I gave them the necklace as your ransom .
I believed Hee Joo , when she came to pick up the ransom .
My priority was to save you , so I gave her the necklace like a fool .
So , you and I were both completely deceived by Cha Hee Joo .
Since the statute of limitation will soon be over that incident will be over and out of my life for good once and for all .
Joong Won .
You still can 't read since that incident , can you ?
Are you sure that it 'll be over for you when you 're still suffering like that ?
No , I can 't read .
But ... there is something that I 've recently found myself wanting to read .
The reason why I came here is because there 's something that I want to show you .
Once you see this , it may shake you back up again . Do you think that you can handle it once you 've seen what 's inside ?
- Is it something to do with Hee Joo ?
- That 's right . But if you don 't want to see it , I 'll leave it with Kang Woo . Tell him to take care of it from his end .
Decide for yourself whether you want to look at it or not . And if you do end up looking at it ...
ask Kang Woo to explain the contents .
You may leave now .
Father ... not telling me about you paying the ransom until now ... was it because you were afraid that I 'd be hurt by the truth ? Did you try to turn it around and make it look like you were to blame ?
You can believe whatever you want to believe .
Have you ever been suspicious of what my true intentions were of you ?
You can believe whatever you want to believe as well .
Take care of yourself .
Cha Hee Joo .
- You startled me .
- Those are the books that you requested .
Why are there so many ?
- It 's not just a single book ?
- There are a few of them . And there 's a ton of writing in there , too .
- There are six books in total .
- Do you want me to read them to you ?
No , that 's okay .
I 'll try reading them myself .
Pok ... poong ... chin-neun ... bam-ae . ( On one stormy night . )
Wow , what a coincidence .
The first night you met Ms. Tae was a stormy night like that , too .
You knew that Cha Hee Joo was one of the culprits , right ?
- That 's ...
- President Joo met with his father today . And he told his father everything .
He did ?
You 've met Cha Hee Joo 's ghost . But were you not able to find out anything about the other kidnapper ?
I did see her , but she didn 't tell me anything that was helpful .
Until President Joo can solve all the mystery surrounding Cha Hee Joo ... he probably wouldn 't let you go , would he ?
Yes , I guess you 're right .
But once the kidnapper is found ... I guess that 's when things will end .
If it 's something I can do , I want to help him find his answers before we end things .
Does this mean ... that you no longer have any more reasons to stay here at Kingdom ?
No . I 'm going to continue to stay here . Because I have to see things through in order to begin a new beginning .
But , I may move to a new place .
You 're moving out of the building ?
Should I not go ?
Shouldn 't you be holding onto me , and telling me not to go ?
Since you 're the building supervisor .
- Please don 't leave .
- But I 've already found a new place .
But the supervisor is asking me to stay , I guess I have no other choice .
I won 't go .
Was he just bragging to me because he got himself an apartment ?
You can 't always be thinking about that .
This could 've been just a joke .
Team Leader Kang . - Have you seen the news on the internet ?
- Why ? You 're the top searched topic on the net .
- Me ?
- Yes .
Superstar Kang Woo .
I 'm going to lose my mind .
Even though your picture didn 't come out that great but you are still the top searched topic , should we get you a pair of sunglasses ?
The person that I 'm dating ... isn 't this man .
The web team looked into this already .
This man is the head of security at Kingdom Mall and it 's seemed like you 've been visiting Kingdom quite often lately .
It 's true that I 've been visiting Kingdom quite often .
If you 'll just admit to the truth , we 'll write up a very nice story for you .
It is true that the last man I dated is someone at Kingdom Mall .
But it wasn 't this guy .
It was the president of that mall ...
Joo Joong Won .
- Kingdom 's president ?
- Are you telling us the truth ?
There 's going to be an article on President Joo ?
Tomorrow ?
Wait ... tell them that we 'll sue them if they publish a false story .
Okay .
What article on Joong Won ?
They 're going to publish an article on President Joo 's scandal with Tae Yi Ryung .
- What ?
- Does your nephew have a girlfriend ?
No , she 's just someone who joined us for dinner a few times . I guess it 's deemed newsworthy with her being a celebrity .
But it 's totally untrue .
We should deny those articles , right ?
Hold on . Let 's first talk to Joong Won , and then we decide .
But , President Joo has Tae Gong Shil .
On top of all that , Tae Yi Ryung is her old schoolmate .
I 'm sure that he 'll tell us that the story is just absurd .
I 'm going to use this to ask Joong Won just where he stands with that girl .
Your nephew 's girlfriend isn 't Tae Yi Ryung , but Tae Gong Shil ?
I 'm sorry .
Here you are joining us for dinner for the first time and you 're being exposed to all our messy family stories .
It 's okay .
It 's very interesting .
Ms. Tae .
Where was the place that you decided on ?
What ?
You told me that you 've decided on a place before we went to the funeral . Where was it ?
Why ?
You 're the weird one here asking me as to the reason why .
I 'm suggesting that we go there .
Why ?
Do you not want to ?
If you want to go , then wait here for just a moment .
What is this ? He told me not to fall for him no matter what .
Is he telling me to wait for him or not ?
I 've been preparing myself for this .
I 've been avoiding you all day , but I guess you 've caught me .
I don 't have much time , so you 've got exactly ten minutes .
The broken pottery and engagement , I guess you 're up since seven .
Joong Won . I heard that there 's an article being written on your scandal with Tae Yi Ryung .
- Who ?
- Yi Ryung .
This should at least be twenty minutes of conversation , don 't you think ?
I 've been pretending that I never got the necklace and if I put the necklace on now , he 's going to think that I want something .
Should I not let him see that I like him just even this much ?
Well , this doesn 't matter to me at all .
Since Tae Yi Ryung is Kingdom 's model we should stop this article for the sake of our image .
Is that really the only reason ?
It 's not because of Tae Gong Shil ?
For a man who breaks off his engagements like it 's his hobby ... I knew that you wouldn 't care about a article that you won 't even read about . But I heard that Tae Yi Ryung is her old schoolmate ?
You sure you 're not just trying to protect Gong Shil ?
Tae Gong Shil doesn 't care about things like that .
I 've already told you this before but she 'll never leave my side over something like that .
That 's what I find to be even more weird .
How could she not care about something like that ?
When I told her that you were getting married she just kept her eyes on that vase , and only talked about other things .
That 's right .
Think of her as someone living on a different planet and just leave her alone .
She 's not someone you can scare away with your usual methods .
You won 't even faze her .
Doesn 't she even have any self-respect ?
Does she love you that much ?
That woman ... has no self-respect .
There 's a reason why she can 't let go of me ... so she doesn 't have the luxury to hold onto any self-respect .
Even when I tell her that I love her ... she doesn 't even have the luxury to accept my love .
That 's why ... she 's safe .
Isn 't that right ?
Yes .
When you told me that you only had ten minutes to give me ... is it because you were taking her to go somewhere ?
Let 's go .
Tae Gong Shil .
You heard everything that we just said , right ? And you still want to leave here with Joong Won ?
Yes .
It doesn 't really matter to me .
Because I don 't have that luxury .
Let 's go .
Joong Won .
That expression on your face right now ... doesn 't seem like she 's very safe to me .
President Joo , I 've decided .
Home is where I wanted to go next .
I want to go home ...
I 'm tired .
I 'm going home .
I shouldn 't have allowed him to see it .
Tae Gong Shil .
I know that you 're in there , so come out right now .
You told me that you could handle anything , so why are you crying ?
It bothers me to see you cry .
Who are you ?
Ah ... are you that jerk , Joo Joong Won ?
Joo Joong Won ?
- What 's wrong with you ? - Why did you come here ?
Do you take her that lightly ?
How can you be all about yourself , you bastard ?
Are you ... possessed by something right now ?
Are you not Tae Gong Shil right now ?
No , I 'm not , you bastard .
I heard that you 're just playing around with her ?
You know what she told me ? You 're a filthy , and dirty player .
So just quietly let her use your body , stop hovering around her and get lost .
I told you to get lost !
Why aren 't you getting lost ?
I just grabbed you .
I left , but I came back because I was angry .
Things like that happens .
What do you know about ghosts ? I may not know about ghosts , but I 've chased plenty of them away .
Because of you having chased a few ghosts away this girl can 't even do anything ... and she 's in a lot of pain .
She 's says she 's in a ton of pain , you awful bastard .
I got it ... so let me talk to Tae Gong Shil .
She says she has nothing to say to you , so leave .
You .
You don 't know how the walnut cracking lady left , do you ?
What ?
Did you smack her ? Watch closely ... and come back to me .

[ Next Episode Preview ]
I need to find the person that you 're trying to protect . Who 's the dead one here ?
- He still can 't read , can he ?
- How did you know that about my nephew ?
I can 't stop myself from falling for you and that upsets me , and wounds my pride .
I 'll protect you like that wolf .
We 're just going to hold hand and sleep .
Don 't even think about anything else .
I think she lost her child . I can see her lost child standing next to her .
- Miss , are you looking for something ?
- I think I 've found him . There you are .
Tae Gong Shil , where are you right now ?
Tae Gong Shil !
Tae Gong Shil .
I love you .
Episode 13 .
I heard that this happened because he was with you ?
I knew that I sensed something bad about you .
- I told you to stay away from him , didn 't I !
Madame Joo .
How 's my Joong Won doing ?
His heart stopped for a moment during the operation but fortunately , his vitals are back to normal and we 've been able to continue on with the operation .
Then , he 's not dead ?
President Joo is still alive ?
He was fortunate that it didn 't pierce his heart .
We were able to safely complete the surgery .
So , he didn 't die after all .
I guess he just briefly stepped out of his body like that lady from the hotel .
I need to see him .
He thinks that he 's dead . I need to check and make sure that he 's back safely .
What do you mean , he 's dead ?
How dare you say he 's dead ?
Don 't ever ... don 't ever come near Joong Won again .
- Ms. Tae .
- How 's President Joo ?
He was able to complete his surgery safely .
Is he awake ?
His aunt isn 't by his bedside right now .
Even for a brief moment , why don 't you go in and see him ?
Thank you .
Following too deeply into your world is dangerous .
I 've ... already ... fallen as far as I could fall .
I was so preoccupied with keeping my eyes on you . I must 've been completely entranced by you .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry .
How 's President Joo ?
Is Tae Gong Shil still here ?
I saw President Joo .
He thought he was dead . He came to say goodbye to me .
What if he doesn 't come back ?
I can see ghosts ... but I can 't call them out .
Darkness swallows up the light ... and death will ultimately swallows up a life .
I have to go see that lady .
Because he saw the sun that shines in the darkness of death ... his soul probably thinks that he is dead now .
He 's probably unaware that he 's still alive , and that he has to go back .
You 're saying that he 's not coming back because he saw me ?
He 's probably ... preparing himself to disappear .
Joong Won .
Are you able to read now ?
It 's because ... I 'm dead .
So , you can finally see me now ?
We can now finally be together .
You have to summon his spirit .
I have to tell him that he 's not dead , and that he needs to go back .
I can 't see spirits like you can ... but I can control the spirits .
Please summon him quickly .
He may never be able to go back if we wait too long .
What can you do for me if I were to help you with your request ?
I need your skills .
Can you offer yourself to me as a sacrifice ?
What will happen to me if I offer myself as a sacrifice ?
You will no longer be able to live your life the way you want .
Why ?
Do you need to think about it ?
There 's not much time .
Sacrifice or whatever else , I 'll be whatever you want .
Just please help me get him back .
The deal has been made .
Okay . I will now summon forth your man 's spirit .
In order to summon him , I need a special item .
An item that he 'd be able to recognize .
Is that proof that you 're his sun ?
I think that would work just fine .
As I 've already told you ... he believes himself to be dead because he saw you when his spirit briefly left his body .
It may be heartbreaking ... but in order to summon him and return him back to life all the moments when you shone so brightly for him ... must be erased from his memories .
Are you saying that he won 't remember the moment when he came to see me ?
I love you .
I said , all the moments . The sun . All the memories of you being with him .
You 're telling me that he 's not going to remember anything at all ?
It 's a choice that you need to make if you want to bring him back .
Will you be okay with that ?
It doesn 't matter .
I was intending to burn out the brightness of this crazy sun from his life anyways .
Well then ... In that case ...
Joo Joong Won ...
Let 's see if we can find him .
You are not dead .
You have to go back .
The only thing that 's going to disappear ... is that light .
Don 't forget ... the deal that you and I made .
He 's probably ... back safely in his body .
Joo Joong Won .
Wake up .
I 've waited 15 long years for the statute of limitation to run out ... and for the day when I would finally get to meet you .
Wake up .
President Joo !
Please ... please open your eyes .
Are you awake ?
You 're awake . Mr. Joo Joong Won .
Your aunt is waiting outside . I 'll go get her for you .
She 'll be so happy to see that you 're awake .
The patient ... is awake .
Joong Won is awake .
That 's such a relief .
Tae Gong Shil . I 'm sincerely making this request from you . This cannot go any further .
- It 's such a relief that he 's awake .
- Wait out here .
I 'll get you in there to see him once his aunt leaves .
No , it 's okay . This is the end .
I won 't go any further than this .
President Joo ... is going to want to see you once he 's fully awake .
No , he won 't .
I 'm not going to appear in his life anymore .
Joong Won . I really thought I was going to die from worrying about you .
What ... happened to me ?
What do you mean , what happened ?
I told you to get rid of her .
You almost died this time following her there .
Follow who ?
Who are you talking about ?
- Chief Secretary Kim .
- Master Joo , you 're awake .
It 's such a relief .
Why ... am I in here ?
Did I really ... get struck by lightning ?
What do you mean , he won 't be able to remember you ?
I was told that he wouldn 't .
Since he was hurt because of a woman who 's able to see ghosts ... all his memories surrounding ghosts , or me will be erased from him .
The house that was in the way of my golf course being constructed ...
I remember going there with Chief Secretary Kim .
Then let me ... get struck down by lightning .
Did I really get struck down by lightning because I was asking for it ?
That 's the last thing that I remember .
The night that you 're referring to was a very long time ago .
Joong Won , do you really not remember anything ?
My whole body feels achy right now . So , I can believe that I was stabbed in the back by a screwdriver .
But ... how did I end up like this ?
It 's because you and Tae Gong ...
Just get some rest for now .
You need to recover first , and we can organize your thoughts later .
But ... who 's that woman over there ?
I 'll introduce you to her some other time .
Just get some rest for now .
Doctor ? Please keep a close watch on Joong Won .
- Chief Secretary Kim . - Yes .
- Honey .
- Yes ?
Let 's go .
How 's your breathing ? It hurts .
It hurts quite a bit .
We will do a more thorough examination tomorrow .
I 'm sure a further examination will confirm but I 'm sure it 's just a temporary memory loss .
Something ... flashed brightly for a moment ... then it disappeared .
You made a promise .
But ... if you truly wish for me to get out of your life ... I 'll understand and disappear at once .
This must be that moment .
It 'll be a good thing if Joong Won never gets his memory back .
I don 't want anyone ... to ever ... mention that girl 's name again in front of Joong Won .
Yes , I understand .
- Chief Secretary Kim .
- Yes ?
Please , I beg of you .
I understand .
The rumor of Master Joo almost dying while he was with Gong Shil is everywhere .
President Joo and Gong Shil went to find the body of the missing boy ... and they had a run-in with the boy 's killer .
And President Joo saved Gong Shil 's life .
How did Tae Gong Shil know that that child 's body was at that auto repair shop ?
You don 't need to know .
We can 't even say anything about it anyways because President Joo 's aunt forbid us from mentioning Gong Shil 's name around him .
If she forbid you from mentioning her ... then you can 't whisper about it either , okay ?
Here , eat this .
You should 've stayed at the hospital longer .
Why did you insist on coming home so soon ?
I can breathe fine on my own now , and I feel more comfortable at home .
Will be you alright alone ?
Why don 't you come stay at my place ?
I already had the cook prepare all the dishes you like .
Can you bring it to me ?
I 'm starving right now .
Really ?
I 'll go get it right now .
Then get some rest .
What ?
Do you have something to say to me ?
What happened to me ?
I get the feeling that my aunt is hiding something from me .
Make it simple , and tell me what happened .
There 's nothing really specific that I can tell you .
You 've been going into your office everyday and all the stores at Kingdom has been performing very well , too .
You just happened to be at auto repair shop with one of your workers by coincidence .
Something important is missing here .
And you know what that is , don 't you ?
I can tell that your lips are just twitching right now with what you really want to tell me .
So , just spill it out while my aunt isn 't here .
My lips aren 't twitching .
- What is this here ?
- I don 't know . Why do you keep asking me ?
It 's a children 's book .
Why are these books doing in my house ?
No kidding .
You can 't even read .
I really don 't know anything , so I have nothing to tell you .
- What 's going on with me ?
- How would I know ?
I really don 't know anything .
Why ... am I ... able to read right now ?
President Joo .
Can you really ... read what 's written in that book ?
Did I really get struck down by lightning ?
Just what in the world happened to me ?
I guess I can wear this now that he won 't recognize it when he sees it .
It 's a protective seal .
Yeah , this is all I need .
This is enough for me .
Tae Gong Shil ... you 've got a protective shield around your neck .
What the heck ?
Joong Won .
Why did you come in to work ?
You should be at home resting .
Aunt , you said that I got stuck in the back with a screwdriver , didn 't you ?
I think that had some magical effect or something .
I can read now . I can easily read every single word .
[ Kingdom - We will make all your wishes come true . ]
I 've walked past that sign a thousand times , and now I can finally read it .
But ... who 's responsible for that PR sign ?
That 's the vice president 's style .
I 'm going to change it .
Gong Shil . He 's finally able to read now .
The trash can man told me about it .
Isn 't it great ?
That 's a relief .
Okay , you 're coming with me .
Chief Secretary Kim . I can read all my files on my own from now on .
I guess it 'll cut down your workload by half , I mean by ninety percent .
I had a feeling that you would be able to .
You 've been making a lot of effort to change .
- I did ?
- Yes .
What 's that ?
The CEO from the Giant Mall sent you these flowers to congratulate your recovery .
I really ... can 't wrap my head around this .
When did the CEO of Giant Mall and I ... become close enough to send each other flowers ?
The two of you even went golfing together recently .
Golfing ?
That 's just absurd .
Since you 're here at the office ... let me know your decision on that personal matter which we haven 't finalized ...
What personal matter ?
The police called to say they 're presenting you with the ' Courageous Citizen Award ' .
To me ?
Why ?
Is it because of that rumor ... about me discovering that dead child 's body and getting stabbed in the back ?
It 's not just because of that .
You also convinced an army runaway to turn himself in before he could hurt anyone . So , they want to thank you for your bravery with that too .
- An army runaway ?
- Yes , you did that .
I 'm sure that wasn 't me .
Something 's wrong here .
It wasn 't Joo Joong Won , but I bet it was 'Joo Joong Two ' and ' Joo Joong Three ' .
This is all so ridiculous , it 's actually making me laughing .
That joke wasn 't funny , was it ?
No , it was all Joo Joong Won .
Since you 're already here at the office ... please finalize your paperwork ... on the Child Abuse Center that you 've agreed to open up and finance .
Wait .
I ... agreed to financially support a child abuse center ?
Not adding another annex to Kingdom , nor adding another parking garage ? - But a child abuse center ?
- Yes . That 's what you said you were going to do .
I 'm sure that my aunt must be feeding me some sort of drugs .
I need to ask her what kind of drugs she 's been feeding me .
No .
I think I need to go in and get another brain scan .
Chief Secretary Kim .
Did you not find it strange ... when I suddenly started doing things that I 've never done before ?
Did the sun rise upside down during the time that I can 't remember ?
I 'm not sure .
Maybe you had a very special sun orbiting around you .
President Joo seriously doesn 't remember you ?
No , he doesn 't .
Amazing , isn 't it ?
At first , I thought that voodoo lady was just a scheme artist ... but she really is gifted .
Are you sure you don 't need to talk to him ?
President Joo 's completely recovered now , and he 's perfectly fine . It was unfortunate that he was hurt ... but that was just an accident . It wasn 't your fault .
Yes , it was an accident .
I know that .
But that really woke me up and set me straight .
I 've always thought that people that are visible to everyone are much scarier than ghosts whom no one else can see .
I met him after being scared by the things that only I can see . I was torn between my world and the reality .
I was so happy to be around him because that meant I finally found a space for me to breathe .
I never considered how deeply I had pulled him into my world ... when he could see none of what I see .
Although I can see ... but I wasn 't cautious enough so I put him , who can 't see , in a dangerous situation .
I 've finally realized that I need to get my head on straight , and live my life .
I think it 's true that people always have to lose something to see clearly .
You know that 's not what this is .
I know that you really truly liked him .
Those feelings ... what are you going to do about them ?
It 's sealed in here .
Since I 'm still holding onto my feelings that I have for him they haven 't disappeared .
So , I will be okay .
I should be walking this way ... so why did I feel the need to walk that way ?
Look at that .
This was just a storage room .
Who are you ?
When did this turn into an office ?
It 's the Special Guest Center .
It 's an office that you had set up yourself .
Special Guest Center ?
I created something so useless as that ?
What about you ?
Kang Woo ?
You 're the new Security Team Leader , right ?
The guy that Vice President recruited . You have enough credentials to work security at the Blue House , right ? Yes .
And this is ?
She 's the employee in charge of this office .
This is her last day here , so she 's cleaning out her office .
I see .
Is there anything else that you 'd like for us to do ?
No , I don 't .
Did I leave ... something there ?
Ahh , my back .
Just leave your stuff here .
I 'll bring them home to you later .
Actually , why don 't I just come with you ?
It 's okay .
There 's not that much for me to take anyways .
What kind of a weak seal is that ?
No kidding .
I can 't let you to walk out of here when you 're about to cry any minute .
I have my Gong Shil .
That Gong Shil you gave me is a huge comfort to me .
I can even read now ... so why do I feel so plugged up as if something 's still stuck ?
Master Joo gave me this picture right before he was injured .
Is this picture the reason why the Chairman met with Master Joo ?
Yes .
This picture was taken a year after Cha Hee Joo died .
He asked me to find out if Cha Hee Joo had a twin .
I wonder ... what Master Joo was planning to do by finding out about this woman ?
He was trying to forget about Cha Hee Joo since he met Ms. Tae .
So why ... was he trying to find her twin sister ?
There 's something that you 're not aware of .
The late Cha Hee Joo ... was one of the culprits involved in President Joo 's kidnapping .
What do you mean by that ?
There 's a very high chance ... that her twin in that picture was her co-conspirator .
Co-conspirator ?
Are you alright ?
You seem really shocked by this news .
Then ...
Master Joo knew all about this , but why did he keep it to himself ?
He knew right from the start that Cha Hee Joo was one of the kidnappers .
He figured out from that picture ... that she had a twin sister , and that she must 've been her co-conspirator .
There 's a chance that the girl in that picture could reappear in President Joo 's life .
We must find that girl in the picture .
Hee Joo was a kidnapper ... and Han Na was her co-conspirator ?
No , that can 't be .
Han Na was such a bright and kind child .
Congratulations on your acceptance into the university .
Thank you , Uncle .
- Your new parents are happy about it ?
- Yes , of course .
- I 'm going to Korea soon .
- Korea ?
Uncle . Didn 't you tell me that I 'm a twin ?
I want to go and find my sister .
I 've made efforts to find her myself ever since I 've been reunited with you . But I haven 't been able to find her .
They say that there 's a special connection between twins . I may be able to find her if I go to Korea myself .
I 'm going to find her .
Okay .
My sister is dead .
Why did you leave her all alone instead of searching her ? - Han Na .
- I hate you .
The dead girl 's name was , Cha Hee Joo .
Cha Hee Joo .
Unlike Han Na , who lived a happy life in England ... she lived a very unfortunate , and lonely life on her own .
Remember the name , Cha Hee Joo .
And for the rest of your life ... feel sorry for her .
I need to find Han Na .
It 's a security alarm that connects directly to the police .
The police will come within a few minutes of you pressing that button .
We need to stay cautious until we catch whoever is after President Joo .
I 'll call you frequently , so make sure to answer your phone .
I 'll be careful .
I told you that I 've got my head on straight now .
I 'm going to protect you from now on .
Kang Woo , I really appreciate that offer ... but I don 't think that I should ... hold onto anyone , and attach myself to anyone .
Not holding on is my way of protecting him .
What are you doing here ?
I 'm not here to see you . I came to see Tae Gong Shil .
I heard she no longer works for Kingdom ?
What do you need to talk to her about ?
Just go back if you 're here to taunt her about what happened with President Joo .
She 's having a hard enough time right now without you adding to it .
President Joo really doesn 't remember anything about Gong Shil ?
President Joo 's aunt asked me not to mention anything about Gong Shil . I just came to see if that 's really true .
So , all that was true ?
OH MY GOD !
Seeing how excited you are , I guess I can 't let you go in now .
Let go !
When I 'm depressed , I need to see others more depressed than me to feel better .
Why do you hate Tae Gong Shil so much ?
I 've always hated her , but I hate her more now because you like her .
Don 't you dare continue to like her .
If you continue to like her ... I 'm going to chase her around , hating her and taunting her .
If it upsets you to see me doing that to someone you like then stop liking Tae Gong Shil right now !
You really are a freak .
You really are a black whiskered whale that doesn 't exist at all .
What ?
Black whiskered whales don 't exist ?
I looked it up . There are white whiskered whales but black whiskered ones don 't exist .
Really ?
I 'm pretty sure I saw those whales with the black whiskers on their faces .
I wonder if it was just something in the water ?
So you remembered what I said , and you looked it up ?
Yeah , I looked it up because I don 't understand someone like you .
Why ?
Because you want to keep me in your pond ?
I already told you that I don 't want any part of that .
You don 't need to take care of me .
Just open yourself up to me .
I 'm such an odd freak , I 'll be able to eat and survive on my own You don 't have to feed me , nor take care of me . I 'm just going to grow larger so that you 'll never be able to get rid of me .
Do you think ... that she views me like I view you ?
Why ?
Do you find what I 'm doing pathetic ?
No .
It 's cool .
- It 's cool ?
- Being confident without begging ... - It 's very cool .
- Really ?
Yeah .
Seeing you has given me strength .
Because I was feeling pretty pathetic just about a minute ago . But I think I need to become as cool as you .
What the heck ?
Are you saying that you 're going to do that for Tae Gong Shil like what I did for you ?
Yeah .
Thanks .
You just taught me something .
Hey !
So , all I did was just give him more courage to go to Gong Shil ?
Kang Woo can 't go to Tae Gong Shil like I do to him .
I 'm Dooley .
Something that doesn 't exist on this earth .
Dooley ?
I 'm such an odd freak that even if you ignore me and not take care of me ... I 'll survive just fine , and grow big all on my own . So , that I 'll grow big as a dinosaur that you 'll never be able to ignore me .
Kang Woo .
Gong Shil .
I can 't allow Dooley to fall into Gong Shil 's arms .
What should I do ?
I told you that I 'd introduce her to you , didn 't I ?
This is Han Na , whom you met at the hospital .
She helped me out a lot that day .
I don 't think President Joo likes it when you bring a stranger into his home ... I don 't think .
Aunt .
I found these books here . Was I reading these books ?
They were in your home , so I 'm sure they 're yours .
You realized that you can read again when you saw those books , right ?
Try to remember .
It has something to do with a very special person ...
A special person ?
Was there a special person in my life ?
Those ... are my books .
I left it here on that day when I was introduced to your maid . I forgot and left them here .
Oh ! That 's right , you did .
Han Na brought those books here .
They 're just children 's books , but it 's still a great story . The illustrations are great , too . Those books are very special to me .
So , my books was the first thing you read since you regained your consciousness ?
That makes me feel pretty good to hear that .
Didn 't you say that Han Na was the first person you saw when you regained your consciousness ?
You two must be fated to be together .
I 'm even reading these days . It 's a six book series and my brain feels like it 's going to split when I tried to read those books .
So , he can read those books now .
I 'm happy for him .
[ Tae Yi Ryung ]
Tae Yi Ryung ?
Hi , Yi Ryung .
Hi , I have something important to tell you in person .
You know that restaurant where we all met up at the last time ?
Yeah .
Meet me there , okay ?
Those two were all googly eyed towards each other at that restaurant .
I 'm sure he 'll remember something if he was to see her there again .
I really can 't stand the thought of Gong Shil with a catch like President Joo either .
What 's so important that you feel the need to call me out in the middle of the night ?
You have a top secret information about Giant Mall ?
Wait right there , I 'll be there soon .
Tae Yi Ryung .
Tae ? Tae .
There 's a ' Tae ' something .
Are you okay ?
Please don 't misunderstand what just happened .
I just grabbed you because I didn 't want you to fall .
I was standing behind you because of that book .
I happened to notice it because I 'm reading the same book .
But ... I don 't know if it 's really appropriate for me to be saying this ... but did you feel that electric shock when we just touched ?
A real strong shock .
No , I didn 't .
Did she think that I was coming onto her ?
Even though your memories are gone ... you 're still my protective shield .
I know I felt something when I touched her .
What could it be ?
It feels like ... something like that must 've happened before .
Master Joo .
A personal matter of mine came up . I would like to take a few days off .
Chief Secretary Kim is asking me for some time off ... that 's the first time in 15 years you 've made that request .
Now that you can read on your own , you don 't need me around as much .
You don 't need a recorder , or an interpreter anymore .
You 're not just a recorder , nor just an interpreter to me .
Do you remember what you requested of me in the beginning ?
You asked me to just be your recorder and interpreter .
You 're still holding a grudge against what a nineteen year old said ?
I always have a need to have you remain by my side .
While I 'm gone ... Deputy Ahn from Vice President 's office is going to take over for me .
Okay .
Enjoy your time off .
- Where will you be going ?
- I 'm going to England .
I 'm going to find my niece , whom I haven 't seen in a while .
Master Joo .
There 's something that I must talk to you about when I return .
You 're not trying to seize this moment to abandon me , and escape , are you ?
I 've already told you , there 's no way that I can allow that .
Yes , I know .
Enjoy a relaxing time off .
Keep your head up , Gong Shil .
Han Joo said he 's going to refer you to a place that 's much better than Kingdom .
If we 're to be honest here ... Tae Gong Shil isn 't someone who should be left to rot away in that dungeon .
- That 's right .
- You have a great education , too . You went to Hankkuk University , right ?
You 're athletic and good at tennis , with a talent for art and other skills . You can even speak a foreign language . French , right ?
You 're pretty and nice ... too many qualities to list all at once .
- Anyways , you have amazing qualifications .
- Thank you . But how is it that you know so much about me ?
No kidding .
I don 't remember telling you about all that .
The blabbermouth who 's works for the vice president told everyone .
- Blabbermouth ?
- Someone you don 't know .
There 's a jerk that 's going around spreading rumors about you .
Han Joo 's going to find out who it is . Once he knows , I 'm going to destroy that loudmouth .
Yes , destroy .
How about you give me a copy of your resume ?
I 'm going to take a quick look , okay ?
In this area where you checked off having some sort of a medical history ... Can you write down some more detail ?
I heard that you were in some sort of an accident ?
Can you write down more details about some of the side effects from that accident , and how your life has been affected ?
If that place is going to be that picky , then just forget it .
Yes , I think she 's right .
Since I can 't write down a bunch of lies , I think it 'll be better to not apply .
Thank you for your concern though .
- I 'll see you later . - Bye .
It doesn 't have to be detailed , just a brief description will do .
To be honest , ever since the accident ... Gong Shil experience things that we can 't really talk about .
If she gets into trouble at a picky place like that it may put you in a difficult spot for recommending her . So , let 's just forget about it .
But I 'll take you out for chicken entrails for all your troubles .
I need to have that resume if I 'm to get the vice president to reimburse me for my expenses .
This is a big problem .
I 'm sorry , please excuse me .
That 's a very pretty necklace .
Your nephew 's girlfriend is not Tae Yi Ryung , so it 's Tae Gong Shil ?
Tae Gong Shil .
The Sun .
- Is it in the shape of a sun ?
- Yes . Thank you .
Cha Hee Joo .
I 'm positive that it was Cha Hee Joo .
That woman ... Just what did she see that made her call out Hee Joo 's name ?
Do you remember Han Na , whom you recently met ?
- I 'm still hurting there .
- Oops , sorry .
I looked into her some more , and she 's a very famous curator .
I told her to come to the office to meet with us ... there 's a chance that we may have an exhibit from a well known artist this fall .
Didn 't you tell me that she 's from England ?
She is originally from England ... but she 's lived all over the place such as L.A. , New York , and China . I heard that she 's moved around quite a bit in her life .
But her family is extremely wealthy , and she 's quite smart too .
Ms. Han Na is here .
Come on in .
Ms. Han Na .
What is it ?
No , it 's nothing . Please have a seat .
Are you saying that Cha Hee Joo is still hovering around President Joo ?
Yes , I 'm positive that I saw her .
I heard that President Joo is back to investigating Cha Hee Joo 's incident . Do you know what 's going on with that at all ?
Tae Gong Shil . Does it bothers you a lot when it comes to things related to President Joo ?
It 's because I can see Hee Joo . I want to do whatever I can to help him resolve this issue .
We have a lead on who Hee Joo 's co-conspirator .
It 's possible that we may still be able to catch the culprit .
- Really ?
- Once we catch the culprit ... everything should be resolved .
President Joo doesn 't remember a thing about you . Which means , he doesn 't even know that you can see ghosts .
Even if you continue to see Hee Joo around ... I doubt you 'll be able to pass along any messages to him .
He 's not going to believe anything that you 'll say to him .
I guess you 're right .
It 's been fifteen years .
I didn 't think that you 'd ever come to England again .
I came because there 's someone that I must find .
Do you ... remember my niece ?
Han Na .
Han Na Brown .
My father is English , and my mother is Korean .
The truth is ... I was adopted .
I was adopted , but I 've heard about my birth parents ... and why I got adopted instead being raised by my own birth parents .
I discovered my uncle when I was still a child .
I see .
He told me that my parents were struggling artists .
They passed away in a car accident ... so I was given up for adoption because I had no family who could take me in .
I was able to find Han Na , who was adopted by her parents in England . But I was never able to find her twin sister .
Han Na grew up in a very happy home , and had everything she ever wanted .
But Hee Joo , who remained in Korea never had any of those opportunities .
I thought she was just a lonely child who grew up alone and suffered a terrible and painful death .
Han Na and Hee Joo ... I have absolutely no idea what happened when those two girls met .
It 's these two kids . They said they were told to give your business card and take whatever toy they wanted .
These are my business cards .
I was told that I 'm planning to finance the child abuse center .
Are you the kids from that organization ?
You came to our apartment and gave us those cards yourself .
You said that we can just give those cards and get whatever we wanted from Kingdom .
I 'm not the type of person who 'd leave my business cards with kids like you two .
Let them just take the toys that they already got . But ... make sure that you tell them the rules and send them away .
You had us read for you , and told us that you 're a special person to her .
Special person ?
You told us that you 're a special person to Gong Shil .
I 'm ... someone 's special person ?
To Gong Shil . Tae Gong Shil , who lives at our apartment .
You said she 's your sun !
Tae Gong Shil ... at your apartment ?
Who 's there ?
Cha Hee Joo .
You 're in love with Joong Won , aren 't you ?
If you want to help Joong Won ... you have to lend me your body .
Team Leader Kang . That 's the woman President Joo 's aunt is trying to get him to marry .
But I have a very strange feeling about this one .
I heard that she lives in the same villa that President Joo lives .
- They live at the same place ?
- Yes . She must be very rich to live in such a grand place all by herself .
I heard that she comes from England .
Why don 't we have dinner together ? I 'll have Joong Won come meet us .
Shall we ?
I think that the way my nephew looks at you ... is different from the way he looks at other girls .
How do you feel about him ?
I 'm interested in him as well .
Then may I be direct and ask you about something that 's been concerning me ?
That woman , Tae Gong Shil ... what was her relationship with Joo Joong Won ?
The truth is , she was pretty close with Joong Won .
She talked about helping him heal a scar that some dead girl left and she attached herself to Joong Won 's side .
Hee Joo , I assume ?
- Did Tae Gong Shil know the late Hee Joo ?
- There 's no way that she could .
She said some nonsense about calling Hee Joo 's ghost to heal his scars or something .
She 's a woman who goes around talking about absolute nonsense .
Yes , I see .
Calling forth a dead person 's ghost ?
That really is all nonsense .
Shall we go ?
Are you ... asking me to give you my body right now ?
Can 't I just relay the message to him for you ?
Then ... will you be able to catch the culprit ?
'One stormy night ' ...
That 's the secret code that the two characters used in that book to recognize each other . You know me , don 't you ?
Who are you ?
Are you ... my sun ?
I 'm ... leaving .
I think I should just be a sun that only shines for those who are already dead .
I only want to remain as a brilliant sun only for those ghosts .
When I 'm by your side ...
That makes me really fear and hate myself .
So , it 's not just that you 're slightly disappointed when I 'm not around ... but I make you fear and hate yourself ?
I don 't want to remain by your side only to become that kind of a sun .
Just ... tell me to get lost now .
The only reason why I was able to ... tell you to get lost all this time without any fear ... was because I knew ... without a doubt in my mind ... that you 'd rise again by my side .
I 'll give it a try ... and do as you wish me to do .
Get lost ... my sun .
Master Joo .
I heard that Ms. Tae is leaving for somewhere very far away .
Weren 't you here with Ms. Tae ?
Where is she ?
Episode 16 .
Make sure to call me often , okay ?
You 're not going to stay away for too long , right ?
I don 't think I 'll know how long I 'll be until I actually get there .
Is he the one that 's going with you ?
That man ...
he 's the one from your accident , right ?
That 's why you shouldn 't worry .
I 'll be back , okay ?
Okay .
Bye .
- Take care , Gong Ri . - Okay .
Go .
I 'll call you .
She left you ?
I thought Tae Gong Shil would be fine as long as I handled everything .
But ... she told me that she 's afraid , and it 's too much for her .
When I thought about it ... I never once tried to understand , nor took it into consideration ... the situation that she may be in .
Then ... are you saying that you 're being considerate , and understanding of Ms. Tae 's situation and that 's why you 're letting her go ?
Do I look crazy to you ?
To let Tae Gong Shil leave me like this ?
Why would I do something that I 've never done in 34 years of my life in such a pivotal moment like this ?
I don 't understand nor want to be considerate of her wanting to leave me .
Please answer your phone .
Did you end things ... with that man ?
How could I have ended it ?
I just ... forced myself to walk away from him .
I wish the plane would just take off already .
It should get better once I put some distance between us , right ?
I told Kang Woo that I was leaving today , but he hasn 't even called .
His crappy dog manners .
Tae Gong Shil left on a flight headed for L.A.
Get me a seat on the next flight out .
I 'm going to follow her .
Yes , I 'll get you a seat on the flight as soon as I get your passport from the office .
- Joong Won is going to America ?
Deputy Ahn received a phone call from Chief Secretary Kim . She just left for the airport with President Joo 's passport .
Why is he going to America all of a sudden ?
What could this be about ?
I 'm not sure .
No , it 's nothing .
Once you go and pass the audition , instead of returning to Korea ... let 's just stay there and hone your acting skills .
I need to use the bathroom .
- Tae Gong Shil .
- Yi Ryung .
What are you doing here ?
Are you going to America , too ?
Are you going to there on a business trip with President Joo ?
No , I 'm just going there to take care of some personal business .
I read in the newspaper that you 're going to America to film a movie .
Oh , that . I 'm just going there for an audition .
- Is he with you ?
- Yeah .
My seat is over there .
Come over to chat if you get bored .
We went to school together .
I got you a seat on a flight that leaves in two hours .
- Nothing sooner ?
- No , nothing as of now .
You just let Tae Gong Shil leave ?
She told me that she was going to leave as soon as Cha Hee Joo 's case was resolved . So ... you just let her leave instead of grabbing onto her and asking her to stay ?
I 'm not letting her leave .
I 'm going to follow her and bring her back .
Even if you were to follow her there , she has a two hour head start on you .
What if you lose track of her during that time gap ?
This is a tracking device .
Take this with you .
I wasn 't sure what was going to happen , so I put a tracking device in Gong Shil 's bag .
Tae Gong Shil doesn 't know that I did that .
Go and make sure that you find her , and bring her back .
You 're a very clever man , Team Leader Kang .
Come back and work for me at Kingdom again .
I 'll double your salary .
Turn it on for me .
[ Tae Yi Ryung ]
Kang Woo .
Did you know that Tae Gong Shil is on her way to America ?
- How do you know that ?
- She 's on the same flight that I 'm on !
She 's going to America with some man whom I 've never seen before .
Really ?
Tae Gong Shil is on the same flight that Tae Yi Ryung is on right now .
The plane is still on the ground .
Hello ?
Hello ?
Hey !
Hey , you dog ...
President Joo Joong Won ?
Ms. Tae Yi Ryung , listen to me very carefully .
I need your gifted acting skills right now .
Excuse me ?
Hey .
Do you consider me a good actress ?
What ?
Make sure you don 't get yourself involved in the act that I 'm about to put on , okay ?
Yi Ryung !
What 's wrong ?
Gong Shil .
My stomach hurts .
What ? What 's wrong with your stomach ?
I don 't know . But it really hurts !
I think it 's my appendicitis !
Help ! Someone help us !
Please ! We need some help !
- Is she okay ? - She needs help .
Gong Shil .
It 's okay , Yi Ryung .
Just hang on .
- Big Sun . - Yes ?
Stay with me .
Big Sun .
Gong Shil !
Don 't leave me , Gong Shil !
- Don 't let me die !
Gong Shil !
Gong Shil !
- Big Sun !
No !
Come with me ! - You go on ahead .
You 're her guardian , so you get in with her .
Tae Gong Shil !
I never knew that a day would come when I 'd be impressed by Tae Yi Ryung 's acting .
You managed to get her to stay , but what are you going to do now ?
Be understanding , and considerate ... I 'm going to have to start doing those things .
I want you to remain by my side and help me .
I 'm not good at things like that . So , if it seems like I 'm doing it wrong , you have to get on my case and if I try to deviate from it , you have to stop me .
Just like what you 've been doing at my side for the past 15 years .
Yes , I 'll do that .
But , Master Joo . I 'm a little disappointed .
I 've been on your case for the past 15 years , but you didn 't even budge . But look at how easily you 've opened up your heart to Ms. Tae whom you 've only known for a brief while .
It wasn 't easy .
You know that I 'm not that easy of a person .
I 'm not so sure .
- Chief Secretary Kim .
- Yes ?
Okay .
Little Sun .
You 're acting way too normal for someone who was dying a minute ago .
Can 't you tell by looking ?
I was faking it .
I 've been taking acting lessons from an acting coach lately and my acting 's gotten much better .
I just got a script for a woman who has terminal illness . Maybe I should do that .
Did you get me off that plane just so that you could practice your acting on me ?
Well , I didn 't really want to go to that audition anyways .
And President Joo Joong Won asked me to do it .
He asked me to get you off that plane .
- President Joo asked you to do that ?
- I didn 't want to do it either .
I don 't like seeing you being happy with someone as successful as President Joo .
It makes me envious of you .
Then why did you do it ?
Because things need to get better for you , and you have to become safe and happy .
In order for him to stop watching over you , and feel safe enough to leave your side ... I couldn 't think of any other solution other than finding you happiness with President Joo .
That 's why I helped him .
If that 's the case , then you shouldn 't have gotten yourself involved .
Because I was leaving so that I could be safe and happy .
You seem to be saying that because you don 't want to lose face in front of me . But that 's not at all how you looked .
'I love you too much , and that 's why I 'm leaving you . '
That 's the candy fluff you 're trying to play off right now .
- Candy ?
- That 's right .
I 'm not good enough , so I 'm leaving for your own good .
Make me stay if you really love me .
If you do , then I 'll relent and stay . I know that 's what you 're doing .
President Joo did more than his share by getting you off of that plane .
Stop playing hard to get , and let him grab onto you now .
If you insist on dragging it out , it 'll only exhaust everyone involved .
Yi Ryung . I have a big fatal flaw , so I can 't pretend to be weak and just grab onto him .
A fatal flaw ?
I think I know what it is .
You need both Kang Woo and President Joo to feel empathy for you and protect you .
Okay , what is it ?
I ... see dead people .
What ?
There 's one in here , too .
I think he was a patient who passed away in this hospital room .
I don 't believe in things like that .
Okay . Anyways , he wants me to pass along a message to you .
He says he 's a fan of yours .
I 'm leaving now .
Hey , Tae Gong Shil !
Where are you going ?
If you leave me all alone after telling me something like that .
It 's scary .
I really hate ghost stories .
When I was being clingy , but even when I 'm leaving ... I 'm still nothing but a gold digging candy girl in everyone else 's eyes .
Woo Jin , it 's you .
But ... why are you still here ?
It 's Woo Jin 's mom .
Woo Jin . Seeing you reminds me of a terrifying memory .
I don 't want to see you .
Mr. Joo Joong Won .
You forcefully brought back the sun that was trying to leave .
But , did you manage to have her rise at your side again ?
- Who are you ?
- I 'm the man that 's leaving with Gong Shil .
I 'm sure that Gong Shil must 've told you .
I 've met someone who can see and hear the same things that I can .
You 're telling me that you see ghosts like Tae Gong Shil does ?
Unlike you ... I 'm someone who lives in the same world which Gong Shil lives in .
Ms. Tae !
- Chief Secretary Kim .
- How could you have left without a word ?
Were you running away ... to avoid Master Joo ?
I wasn 't running away .
- I was just going to search for something .
- Search for what ?
The reason why I ended up this way .
I was leaving to search for a reason why I was made to be able to see dead people .
Are you saying if she goes to those places that she 's been with you that she 'll be able to find the reason why ?
I 'm not sure of that myself .
We can only know once we get there .
When you 're not even sure of it yourself you were still trying to take her that far away from here ?
That 's not what 's important .
What 's important is that for the very first time ... Gong Shil has started to take a real look at herself and who she is .
She 's hid herself away living in torment while avoiding others all these years , hasn 't she ?
And when you appeared , you were like a safe haven she could escape to .
But , now ...
Gong Shil is considering stepping out on her own away from you .
That 's why I came to see Gong Shil .
What is it ... that you can do for Tae Gong Shil ?
Her memories from those three years that she roamed this earth as a spirit ... I 'm going to help her regain those memories .
Since that 's when she started seeing spirits ... once she regains her memories of that time ... it 'll transform Gong Shil .
- How so ?
- She won 't be afraid anymore . She may be able to accept her ability to see spirits , or ... it 's possible that she may even lose that ability .
You 're saying that it 's possible she may not be able to see ghosts anymore ?
Yes .
Whether she accepts her ability , or loses her ability ... the defense shield you can offer to Gong Shil will become meaningless to her .
Is Tae Gong Shil aware of all this ?
Yes .
That 's why she 's coming with me .
So , you thought that I was leaving for President Joo 's sake ?
I was really only thinking of myself when I tried to leave .
Now that I think about it , Candy is much more of a romanticist than I am .
To leave like that for the sake of someone else .
I 'm not that innocent , bright , nor kind hearted like that .
You 've changed a lot , just like how Master Joo has changed .
You used to say that you were just grateful to have someone like you .
The sun that was crumpled down below is now saying how she wants to rise high up in the sun and shine brilliantly .
And there 's nothing I can do about it either . I 'm at a loss for what to do .
Seriously .
Then do you think President Joo could have the same misunderstanding ?
Do I really have to put on my Candy act ?
I 'm not sure .
I 'm not sure where Master Joo stands .
He 's Master Joo .
Even though I had to force you to come back ... I feel like I can finally breathe again now that you 're standing in front of me .
Listen , President Joo . Why did you hold me back ?
I was trying to leave for your own sake because I knew I wasn 't good enough for you .
Who do you think you 're talking to ?
Do you think that I 'm going to run over to you and hold onto you from the back just because you 're putting on that act ?
Was I being that obvious ?
Did the blunt and brazen sun all of a sudden become a moon of purity ?
I just thought that you 'd feel less offended and be a little bit more understanding if I told you that I did what I did for your benefit sake .
Even if you come off sounding really blunt , I like you better when you 're being honest .
I don 't like it when you change who you are which only ends up confusing me .
Okay , then I 'll be blunt and tell you how it is .
I ... I 'm leaving for the sake of my own survival .
It 's not that I hadn 't thought of you at all ... but my own well-being came first .
Initially , I felt comfortable to cling onto you as my defensive shield .
Because I just clung onto you without having to think about anything else .
Then I started to have feelings for you , I think that 's when it all started .
That 's when I started hating myself for my ability to see ghosts .
You told me that you 'd lower yourself as much as you can to suit me , right ?
But ... I felt so pathetic about how low my life was .
I can 't live like this anymore .
I need to find out why I ended up this way .
I want to get rid of my ability to see ghosts if I can .
Can you find your reason , and come back to me ?
I can 't promise you that I 'll come back to you .
Because if I don 't change from the way I am now ... there 's no way that I 'll return to your side ever again .
I told you , didn 't I ? I don 't want to remain as the sun of misfortune at your side .
The day that I got stabbed by the screwdriver ... I never should 've gone after you .
And fortunately , your life didn 't end then ... you were able to find a way to continue on with your life the way you 're meant to .
Can you understand what I 'm saying ?
I 'm not a dumb street mutt .
I got it , so you can give it a rest .
Thank you .
Seeing how you 're able to walk around freely at a hospital when you once told me that it was the scariest place to you in the world ... I guess you won 't be coming back because you missed having your defensive shield .
I need to find another weapon to bring us back together .
Wait for me until I do .
I 'm going to leave just like I had planned .
Then you 'll be meeting some cops on your way to the airport .
Why ?
Because ... you 're a sexual molester .
You 've touched every nook and cranny of my body .
You even crawled onto my bed without my permission .
You even paid me for the privilege of doing that , didn 't you ?
10,000 won .
One million won .
Didn 't you just tell me that you understood ?
Even if I understood , I have no intention of being considerate .
There 's no way that I 'll just send you off peacefully .
I 'm just going to start doing whatever I want from now on without a guilty conscience .
You can handle everything from now on all on your own .
Once I think that you 're no longer afraid of ghosts , and that you 'll be okay alone ... that 's when you can tell me to stop coming , and go back to my own neighborhood .
That woman doesn 't have any self-respect .
There 's a definite reason why she can 't let me go ... and that 's why she doesn 't have the luxury to care about any self-respect .
I don 't get scared when I 'm sure of the ending .
All I ever told her every day was for her to handle everything and that there was a sure ending for us . And now ... I got what I asked for .
But still ...
I got to tell her exactly how I felt .
I love you .
Would that ... have been enough ?
I guess I must 've gone as far as what I feared in my worst case scenario .
I totally forgot that I said those words to her .
The things I said to Madame Go ... that was the worst thing I could 've said .
Death , the end , and not being attracted ...
I said some words that I never should 've said if it hadn 't been for that specific situation .
I don 't want to retrieve those words just to complicate things again .
No , I 'm sure she didn 't hear me say that .
The deal with Madame Go is all over now . I even paid her a huge amount of money so that she never comes back again .
I need to say nicer words to her . That way I can ask her how can she treat me so coldly like this .
I heard that Han Na Brown was the culprit ?
Ugh , it could 've been really bad for President Joo .
Can you imagine how bad it would be if they got together like you wanted them to ?
I can 't even fathom how shocked my Joong Won must 've been .
You said that they were able to catch her all thanks to Tae Gong Shil 's help , right ?
Yes .
Honey . What Bang Shil did was amazing .
Honey .
Joong Won . Are you okay ?
Aunt . I 'm really struggling right now , so let 's do this some other time .
Okay .
President Joo . I 'm sure that you must be exhausted .
I 'll take care of the Shanghai meeting , and the finalization of all the paperwork .
I have both sides of my brain for that , one to ponder business ... and the other side for my own personal life . I can take care of them both myself .
So both of you ... just leave .
Go , I said .
It seems as though President Joo is suffering from the huge shock .
I think he needs someone who 'll be at his side to comfort and console him .
He has me .
Yes , I know that he has you . What he needs now is a warm loving presence .
Who are you referring to ?
I 'm talking about Bang Shil .
Deputy Ahn told me a few things . And I guess Tae Gong Shil was trying to ... leave for somewhere far away after she resolved the case for him .
President Joo went after her and got her back .
My goodness ... my heart just breaks for them .
I was really touched after I heard the story about the two of you from Deputy Ahn .
You getting on that plane , and Master Joo coming after you .
That 's just unbelievable .
If you really want to test the boundaries of love getting on the plane and pretending to leave is a pretty good tactic to use . You know your stuff .
It wasn 't like that .
Gong Shil . President Joo went through all that trouble to bring you back and make you stay . You shouldn 't go .
Okay ? He 's not the reason why I 'm leaving .
Hey , that man ...
You told me that he even knows about the things you see .
If he 's telling you that he still likes you even after knowing all that then shouldn 't that be the end of it ?
Even in your eyes ... do you think that he 's above my limit , and I 'm playing hard to get undeservingly ?
Ms. Tae Gong Shil , you should give it a rest and stop playing so hard to get , okay ?
Why are you talking to my sister like that ?
Ms. Tae Gong Shil .
You 're being asked to come to the vice president 's office .
- Me ?
- Yes .
Why ?
Once she gets President Joo 's aunt 's approval ... then I guess things will go the way that the vice president wanted it to go .
I didn 't think that it was possible for Master Joo and Gong Shil to work out . I was starting to wonder if I got on the wrong side of the fence but it ends up that I had chosen the golden side of the fence .
Lee Han Joo , you were on the vice president 's side ?
Of course , I 'm the vice president 's eyes , ears , mouth .
I 'm his head , shoulders , knees and toes ... Then were you the blabbermouth from the vice president 's office ?
All those times that you took me out to eat jokbal and everything else it was all so that you could go around blabbing that mouth of yours ?
So , you were just fishing for information ?
Wait , Tae Gong Ri !
I 'm not going to touch you , nor provoke you for the time being .
So , stop with all that needless talk of leaving just to make things harder for my Joong Won right now .
You two are telling me that you can 't live without one another and it seems I 've just made things even more poignant and heart wrenching by getting in the middle of it .
So , I 'm not going to do that anymore .
I trust that my nephew won 't go off the deep end ... and he 'll come back to his senses .
No , don 't do that .
I don 't have the luxury to love anyone to the point of it being heart wrenching .
You once told me that I was ominous , didn 't you ?
What you said was right .
I 've dragged President Joo into my life and made him stand on the brink on the death . Yet , here I am staring into that face all over again . I 'm never going to repeat that same mistake again .
Bang Shil . Do you have a grudge against me because I was a bit harsh with you in the past ?
Are you trying to get an apology from me or something ?
- Is that it ?
I know that it 's only because you love President Joo very much .
You 're very precious to the person that I care deeply about .
If anything , I 'm grateful to you .
Are you ... trying to play me , too ?
No .
I 'm just going to leave you be , and get lost for good .
It seems as though you 're starting to have some doubts .
Everyone can 't seem to understand me . They all thought the same ... that I was bluffing and playing hard to get .
They think it 's ludicrous that someone like President Joo would want me to stay .
Then ... do you want to try remaining at his side ... and live your life together while enduring and handling what may come your way ?
Because it seemed to me that he was ready to do that .
You know that I can 't do that .
My decision to leave was an extremely difficult decision for me to make .
Even the thought of never being able to see him again ... makes me feel completely empty inside .
This kid ... is he following you around ?
His name is Woo Jin .
He follows me because he 's really worried about his mom .
- Are you not going to help this kid out ?
The last time I followed this kid , I almost caused Joong Won to die .
I 'm going with you because I don 't want to do anything like that again .
Then , I 'll wait for you at the airport tomorrow .
It 's up to you whether you 'll come with me or not .
So you 're the cause of Gong Shil 's agony , huh ?
It seems as though even her final decision ... will all come down to you again .
She 's sleeping ?
After threatening me to come with the necessities after a fake hospitalization ... and she sleeps ?
It seemed like a big project led by a famous director .
I wonder if she 's making a huge mistake by letting go of this opportunity .
Seeing how she 's sleeping so peacefully ... she seems perfectly fine to me .
What the heck ?
Did you attack me just now ?
Even though I 'm a little flustered by your surprise ambush ... but I came prepared for it . So , I won 't get mad at you .
But ... are you sure that was enough ?
I was prepared for something even more drastic with you being the black whiskered whale and all .
But thanks for such a bland ending .
What ?
You really won 't get mad if I do something more than that ?
No , I wouldn 't have gotten mad .
It 's an opportunity that you even gave up an international movie for ... but that 's too bad .
Kang Woo !
That didn 't count .
I 'm going to do it right this time .
There are reporters waiting outside .
You can 't come out there , okay ?
I should 've just jumped on him .
I was attempting to organize my thoughts in order to renegotiate with you . I discovered a huge injustice along the process .
The more I think about it , the more ridiculous it all seems .
What 's ridiculous ?
You and I 've been taking turns talking about our end .
When in fact , we 've never even really started .
We 've never once shared a meal , or held hands without having a ghost involved .
Talking about our ending when there wasn 't even a beginning ...
Yes , it 's funny .
I 've touched you , grabbed you , and poked you enough to get accused of sexual harassment .
But I 've never once touched you just because I wanted to from liking you .
Forget all that talk about leaving and just grab my hand and let 's just go grab dinner together .
It feels weird .
I think this is the first time I 've ever held your hand without there being a ghost .
See ?
Doesn 't it feel unfair to just end it after only having held hands once ?
Since I 've grabbed onto your hand , why don 't we go have dinner together ?
I 'll just go in and change real quick .
Make it quick .
Enjoy your meal .
This is my favorite udon restaurant .
This place is the best in this area .
I love udon so much , that I find myself eating it about five times a week .
This is the first time I 've ever heard of how much you like udon .
Do you like udon , too ?
I hate these fat noodles that sits in a bowl of this hot broth .
I like the refreshing tasting and thin nangmyun noodles .
- I see . So you like nangmyun ?
- That doesn 't mean that I like all nangmyun .
I only like it from this certain restaurant . It 's number three on their menu .
But ... ever since the grandmother of that place passed away the flavor of the dish changed , so I 've quit eating nangmyun .
Really ?
Had I known sooner , I would 've stopped by that nangmyun place .
If that deceased grandmother was still there don 't you think I could 've found out why the flavor of the dish had changed ?
If you leave just like this ... even my chances of ever eating another bowl of nangmyun also disappears .
I find that to be unfair , too .
Where 's that nangmyun place ?
I 'll stop by before I leave .
Don 't pretend to care when you 're just going to leave and abandon me .
Go on and eat before your fat noodles get fatter .
I hope you really enjoy eating it ... and that you feel a sense of longing whenever you eat another bowl of udon .
I come to this place from time to time to get some exercise .
I used to be really good at sports . I was especially good at tennis .
I 'm good at other thing besides tennis such as horseback riding , golf , and archery .
I guess you would 've concentrated more on being athletic since you couldn 't read .
I , on the other hand , only read because I couldn 't go outside .
That 's too bad .
We could 've lived together with me reading all the books that you 'd recommend and with me teaching you all the sports that I 'm really good at .
You 're breaking the fundamental structure of ' Give and Take ' when you leave .
I guess you 're right .
I 've always wanted to learn how to horseback ride , and how to golf .
I have horses , golf courses , swimming pools , and tennis courts .
I have them all . In other words , you could say that I have a lifetime membership to all those things .
You even have horses ?
I saw the ghost of a horse once .
But you can 't ride the ghost of a horse .
President Joo .
There 's an old lady sitting on that bench who likes to mess with couples on their dates .
All the couples that sits on that bench ends up breaking up .
Excuse me !
They 'll end up breaking up if I just leave them alone .
Then let them break up .
My relationship is about to be broken up as well .
I don 't want to see others having a happy ending .
Tae Gong Shil .
Don 't go .
Ms. Tae told me that she was leaving for the sake of her own benefit .
That 's why I 'm sure Master Joo won 't be able to force her to stay either .
I 've always thought that President Joo could do the things for Tae Gong Shil that I never could do for her myself .
That 's why I 've taken a step back only to stare at her from afar .
But ... if Tae Gong Shil is saying that she herself is what she 's really afraid of ... then the only thing President Joo can do ... is to take a step back and watch her as he waits for her like I 've done .
Master Joo has never once accepted a person 's decision for what it is .
Whether he 'll be able to be understand and be considerate of her decision ... is something that I 'm not sure he 'll be able to do .
I didn 't even know that jerk was the blabbermouth I 've been searching for . I went out to eat chicken gizzards , and even lamb hearts with him ?
Hey ! Blabbermouth !
This is my bottle .
I didn 't pour that drink just so you can dump it into that cheap blabbermouth of yours .
Hey , blabbermouth .
Why aren 't you saying anything ?
Why don 't you try saying something ? Huh ?
That cheap mouth of yours is useless unless it 's used for gossiping , right ?
Hey . Hey !
What ... what did you just do with that cheap mouth of yours ?
Now that 's the only kind of excuse my lips can make .
Your excuse ... was a little short .
Then ... should I give you a longer explanation ?
First of all ... since you can 't be the only sober one here , start drinking .
Give us another bottle .
It tastes so sweet . So sweet .
I really like the rooftop of your place .
I can now understand why you say that you feel most comfortable up there .
It 's a perfect place to have a beer .
I want to fill up your fridge with beer ... and I want to come over every day to have one .
Tae Gong Shil .
How many beers should I get to fill up your fridge ?
Should I buy one beer for tonight , or can I fill it up as much as I want ?
For now ... just a single pack .
Six beers ?
I want to have a beer too while holding your hand .
If it 's only six beers , we can either drink them all tonight or if there are still some left ... then you can come back another time . Okay .
One pack .
Any specific kind you like ?
No , I 'll figure that out on my own .
We 'll just start off with a pack .
It would be too unfair to just leave without even doing that .
One pack .
Six days .
I 've bought myself that much time at least .
Woo Jin .
Gong Shil , please help my mom .
No , I don 't want to .
I 'm not going to look at you .
Gong Shil .
Please help me .
I 'm not going .
Go away .
I said , I 'm not going !
Where did she go ?
[ President Joo ]
Why isn 't she answering her phone ?
Miss . Aren 't you going to answer your phone ?
I wasn 't sure what was going to happen , so I put a tracking device in Gong Shil 's bag .
Found it .
Driver , stop the car .
Woo Jin . Mommy is coming to be with you .
Ma 'am !
No , you can 't !
Please don 't do this !
Let go !
Please don 't do this .
Don 't do this !
Please calm down .
You can 't do this .
Woo Jin .
Woo Jin !
- You can 't do this .
It 's too dangerous .
- I want to go to him !
It 's okay .
Woo Jin is standing next to her .
He came to ask for my help because his mother was in danger .
I almost got you killed the last time I followed that kid .
But I ended up following him again .
Even though I stopped her this time , she may try doing the same thing again .
That 's her life .
How can you expect yourself to handle all that ?
I kept being swayed because I continue to see and hear them .
Even though I really hate it , this is just who I am .
I can 't even handle myself . So , how can you be expected to handle me ?
If you go with that man ... will you then be able to stop seeing the things that you don 't want to see ?
I don 't know .
But don 't you think that I should at least try to find out why I ended up this way ?
I 'll accept your decision .
Okay .
This ends right here .
Tae Gong Shil .
You and I are nothing but two people who 've only held hands once and shared one single meal together .
It means that we 'll easily forget one another .
I 'm going ... to forget you .
Okay .
If you really hate me ... you can curse me and call me a bitch who left you after bewitching you .
No , thanks .
There 's no need to curse out a woman whom I 've only held hands and dined with once .
I 'm leaving .
Even to the very end ... she hadn 't said ... that she loves me .
It has now been three hundred ... and seventy five days since the sun gone down in my life .
But I haven 't collapse and crumble .
What should I wear today ?
- Is everything prepared ? - Yes .
Our sales and revenue must beat out Giant Mall in the annual sales report .
We 're preparing some special events for the end of the year sales drive .
I 'll be leaving for Shanghai after this season ends .
We need a huge and definitive advantage over Giant Mall in sales before I leave .
- How much ?
This much . - This much .
Even bigger .
This much !
Once Joong Won leaves for Shanghai next year ... you 'll be taking over his position as the President of this location .
The thought of that gives me the butterflies .
I have to do whatever I can to make sure that he gets married before he leaves .
He sees Ms. Park So Hyun with all the frequent meeting with Sejin Group , right ?
- What do you think of those two ?
- They only get into hot debates over money .
I don 't see any possibilities between those two .
Why don 't you try setting up a dinner or something after one of those meetings ?
You can do that , can 't you ?
Well ... yes , okay .
But ... From the way I see it ... it seems to me that President Joo is waiting .
Do you think that it makes any sense that Joong Won would wait around for anyone ?
As long as he wants , I can get a line of women for him from here to the moon .
But ...
Bang Shil ?
What is she ... a princess from outer space or something ?
- Why would he wait for her ?
- Well , you know ...
I 'm waiting for the sun to rise again .
As a show of your belief that the sun will rise again ... can you bang the can , and spin the lid ?
Thanks .
In its own way , it comforts me when you bang the can and spin the lid for me .
Deputy Ahn .
Did you tell him that his meeting with Sejin Group is at the Palace Hotel ?
Yes , Sejin Group called this morning to confirm as well .
Oh no , what to do ?
I needed to coordinate with President Joo 's schedule and set the meeting up at Kingdom but I seemed to have made a mistake .
I have to go with him to that meeting .
President Joo will probably get really upset if we change the schedule .
I 'll speak to him since I 'm the one who made the mistake .
How in the world did I make such a simple mistake like that ?
I wonder if I was bewitched by a ghost .
We 're here way too early for the meeting .
There 's no way that Chief Secretary Kim would 've made a simple mistake like this . I wonder ... if he 's really sick ?
Chief Secretary Kim .
Have you been to the hospital yet ?
You still have to consider your age even if it is just a cold .
Take the next few days off and rest .
You 're going to get me sick with your cold .
I 'm going to send over the doctor , so just stay home and don 't go anywhere . What about dinner ?
I 'll send over some of your favorite tuna porridge .
No , you can 't have any ice cream .
I 'm hanging up .
I noticed you when you first walked in .
If it 's okay with you , can I join you for a drink ?
No , I 'm actually waiting for someone .
You 've been sitting here by yourself all night .
- Well , yes ... excuse me .
- Yes ?
- Would it be okay if I moved my seat ? - Yes , go ahead .
Thank you .
This change is nice .
Has Seoul 's night skyline always been this pretty ?
Excuse me , Miss .
Would you like to have a drink with me ?
No , thanks .
Please go away .
You look so much like someone I know .
I said , forget it .
You 're really ... not going to look at me ?
I 'm here with someone .
Who ?
A ghost ?
It is you , Tae Gong Shil .
The bitch who left me after bewitching me .
Subtitles by DramaFever
I 'm a unique and special entity in your world .
The only way I won 't be aggrieved is if you felt like dying without me .
But , I don 't know what to tell you .
I just feel slightly disappointed when you 're not around .
Just slightly disappointed ?
I haven 't been waiting around hoping for you to remember me .
All I needed to do is show you this and you 'll remember who I am .
But I purposely kept it and didn 't return it to you .
You purposely kept it to yourself ... and didn 't return it to me ?
Yes .
I thought it would be better for the both of us not to have this .
I was planning to throw this away since it was just something that I picked up .
Here , you can have it .
You were seriously ... thinking of throwing it away ?
Yes .
So , if I hadn 't taken it upon myself to remember and recover it . You really were planning to toss this away , and never to be found again ?
Yes .
Anyways , I 've already thrown it away .
Then ... should I throw it away too ?
Since it 's yours to begin , you can do whatever you want with it .
Fine .
Then I 'll throw it away , too .
I 'll simply get rid of it .
Are you in pain ?
Yeah , I 'm in pain .
I feel like my back is splitting in half .
I thought you 've fully recovered .
Have you ever been stabbed with a screwdriver ?
If it had gone any deeper , it would 've pierced my heart .
Does it still hurt ?
The moment I got my memories back ... the shock and agonizing pain I felt when I got stabbed came back , too .
Let 's get you home .
Yeah , I think I need to go home .
Take me to the parking garage .
I 'll go get someone to help you .
I got hurt because of you , and you can 't even help me walk ?
Aren 't you being too harsh ?
Okay , let 's go .
You didn 't even once visit me at the hospital while I was there , did you ?
Why are you disappointed when you don 't even remember being there ?
Do you know how much pain I was in ?
To be honest , it still aches whenever I take a breath .
Yes , I 'm sure that you were in a great deal of pain .
Is that the best you can say ?
Can 't you be a bit more sincere when you say that ?
Yes , I 'm sure that you were in a great deal of pain .
Right there .
That 's where it hurts .
- You do the driving .
- Me ?
Then you expect me to drive when I 'm in this much pain ?
Unlock the door .
It 'll be dangerous if something jumps out while you 're driving .
This is for my own safety .
Just concentrate on driving .
I have to concentrate on enduring my pain .
Start the car .
I 'm sorry , Han Na .
I don 't think Joong Won was feeling well , he probably went home .
I think he went off to see Tae Gong Shil .
I guess he still feels drawn to her even though he has no memories of her .
She was the woman he cared far enough to risk his own life . It 's understandable that he would feel this way .
Did Mr. Joo Joong Won get hurt in his attempt to save her ?
- No !
- Yes , that 's right .
I see .
I had no idea that Tae Gong Shil meant that much to Mr. Joo Joong Won .
We look the same ... but you 're not the one that Joong Won likes .
The only thing that Joong Won knows is that he likes a girl named Cha Hee Joo .
I want to tell Joong Won ... who I truly am .
I 'm sorry , Hee Joo .
I wasn 't able to take in my twin nieces that my sister left behind .
Of the twins ... Han Na was adopted , and she moved to England . And Hee Joo grew up in an orphanage here in Korea .
Didn 't you tell me that I have a twin ?
I want to go and find my sister .
This is the picture they sent me when they met for the first time .
I was going to come to Korea myself , so that I could also meet Hee Joo . But when Han Na came back to England ... she told me that Hee Joo had died in an accident .
My little sister is dead .
Why didn 't you look her ? She was left her all alone there .
And I haven 't seen Han Na again since that day .
But ... why do you think that after these past 15 years ... she 's appeared by Master Joo 's side ?
There 's a very high probability that she was the co-conspirator .
Han Na ... would 've never done something like that .
President Joo will be shocked when he finds out Han Na is the late Cha Hee Joo 's twin . But , when he finds out that you 're a blood relative of Cha Hee Joo 's ... he will be tremendously shocked .
It 's even possible that he may misunderstand the nature of your true intentions .
You think ... that all those years that I 've remained by Master Joo 's side ... would end up in a terrible misunderstanding ? One in which he may never forgive me ?
Get some rest .
I 'm going to get going now .
What would you like to drink ?
I 'm going to have a beer , and you can have a soda .
Since I don 't have any soda , you can have some sparkling water .
I thought that you said you were in pain .
Do you really think that I 've brought you all the way here because of my back pain ?
You know that wasn 't the real reason , but you still came with me .
Okay , let 's just forget everything that we 've agreed to disregard ... and start over from scratch , and reorganize our thoughts .
Okay , fine .
Let 's talk now since I 'm here .
I understand that you wanted to run away because of your guilt .
You probably think this was all your fault for dragging me in but I 'm also partly to blame because I ran in there without a plan .
End of story .
We just need to more cautious from now on .
I 'd always anticipated that we 'll end things at some point and that made me wanted to keep one foot out the door .
But ... after that near death experience ... that 's when I knew for sure ... I don 't want to end things with you .
I 'm not going to end it .
Just remain by my side .
I 'll handle everything .
So , you 've already decided that 's what you want to do ?
That 's right .
So , when I start to seduce you ... you just need to fall for me and come to me .
Drink up .
I don 't think that I 'm going to fall for you that easily .
To me you are no longer ... the desperately necessary entity that I needed like before .
I 'm your defensive shield .
What happened ?
Did I lose my ability when I got stabbed by the screwdriver ?
No , that 's not it .
It 's just that I 'm no longer afraid of the ghosts like I used to be .
So , I no longer need to have a defensive shield .
You 're still really great , and rich and all ... but that ultimate attractiveness about you that drew me to you is no longer there .
You sucked up to me by saying that I was a shield made out of the finest marble in this world when you really needed me .
But , what am I ?
You no longer find me attractive because you 're not afraid ghosts anymore ?
Yes .
It 's the same thing as a woman liking a man for his money and the guy loses his attraction to her when he loses his fortune .
I 've lowered myself as much as I could go to fit you on your level ... but you 're telling me that that my worth has gone down ?
Then do you want to renegotiate our terms ?
Don 't lower yourself to suit me , or fall any lower either .
I told you that I don 't want that .
I 'm going to go now .
Okay , you can go for now .
We 'll renegotiate once I 'm done staring at myself in the mirror and find some other appeal that I can offer to you .
You do that .
You .
She says you 're not attractive .
You 've never heard that before , have you ?
No , don 't quiver .
And don 't get angry either .
We 'll go back and renegotiate .
Just endure it .
Unclench your fist .
This is no fun .
I 'm unattractive to her .
You 're quick with your calculations .
Just name your price .
I 'll give you whatever you want .
You must 've figured out a very precise answer to your calculation .
Once I pay up , Tae Gong Shil 's contract with you is over .
If you ever drag her into your plans again I 'll become the matchmaker this time and marry you off to one of your spirits .
But for that to happen , it would mean that you 'd have to die first .
I will never ... block your sun from you again .
I 'll try talking to Madame Go .
Your top priority is their looks ?
Why do you care so much about looks when you 're already dead ?
Excuse me ?
You think that man is perfect ?
But ... that man is still alive !
What are you thinking ?
Just get lost !
I heard that it 's going to rain tonight .
- Are you going on your GT dressed like that ?
- What 's a ' GT ' ?
The ' Ghost Training ' that Madame Go makes you go on .
Did you train yourself to not be afraid when you go ghost hunting ?
- I 've signed a contract with her .
- That 's all over now .
She and I have come to a settlement .
There 's no need for you to thank me . Just give me extra points to make up for the points I lost on my attraction scale .
Ah ... you settled it with her ?
That 's good .
I 'm sure you 've already heard ... I signed that contract because I want to bring you back to life .
I thought it was great that you were able to wake back up safely ... but I did feel that it was a little unfair that I got shafted on this .
Shafted ?
Sacrifice , devotion , love ...
It would sound so much better if you had used those kinds of words instead .
Feelings like that only exist in fairy tales .
The wolf and the lamb who meets on that stormy night ... their feelings for each other are so pure and sweet , isn 't it ?
That because it 's a children 's book .
But in reality , a wolf and a lamb cannot be together .
You 're well aware of that yourself .
I came back to life from the brink of death . I left reality to jump into a fairytale . But it sounds like you crawled out of the fairytale into reality during that time .
Mine was a very cruel fairytale .
A dark fairytale where a person dies and come visit the other .
It scared me so much , I crawled out of that fairytale .
You should just go back to your neighborhood now .
This is the third time you 've told me to get lost today .
Which means , I 've endured you turning me down three times .
Don 't you remember what you once said to me ?
Sticking around after being told to get lost is something only a mutt would do .
It seems to me that you 're not taking your own advice .
My ears are wide open , and I can hear you very well . But , I don 't understand it .
Grandmother , what are you doing here again ?
We 're in the middle of an important conversation .
What are you doing ?
Tell them to come back another time .
Your son is there doing that again ?
That 's very dangerous .
Okay , let 's go .
Where are you going ?
Don 't touch me .
This isn 't the time for your defensive shield .
Just go home .
This is the fourth time she told me to get lost .
I 'm counting the number of times .
- Grandmother , it 's okay .
- I think it 's going to start raining soon .
Are you really not afraid at all ?
I can handle it .
Is your son in a bad state ?
You 're not able to leave in peace because your son is still causing trouble , right ?
What grandmother ?
Tell me what 's going on .
You can 't see the grandmother anyways .
So , you don 't need to know .
Right ?
Why are you laughing ?
What is it ?
What do you care ?
You can 't hear her anyways .
Yes , you 're right . He is , right ?
- He 's a bit ...
- Are you guys talking about me ?
I don 't need to hear to know that . You 're insulting me , right ?
There he is !
Mister !
Mister from the supermarket !
Mister !
Mister !
I can see him , too .
How much did he have to drink ?
Mister .
Mister from the supermarket !
Grandmother , should I wake him up like I did before ?
National Singing Competition !
I won first place at that competition .
Yes , you did .
Someone who won first place at a national singing competition can 't be lying in the middle of the streets , right ?
It 's very dangerous to be there in front of the truck like that .
Come on , let 's go .
You could 've just explained what was going on to me .
If that man was dangerous and if he held a weapon at me would you run to save me again like the last time ?
What if he had a gun in his hand ?
Would you have taken the bullet for me ?
I 'm not going to drag you into situations like that anymore .
Are you asking me to leave you to face these dangers alone ?
It 's more dangerous when the two of us are together .
We don 't see or hear the same things .
You can grab onto me and not see or hear anything either .
How can I live my life clinging onto you like that ? I have my own world to live in .
So , you were serious when you told me that you can live without me .
You were bewitched because of my persistent clinging .
Truthfully , no other woman in this world would 've come onto you like I did .
I came back even after getting pulled away by the hair .
I clung onto you even though you 've told me to get lost a 100 times .
I 'm sorry , President Joo .
There 's absolutely no reason why you should let me stick around you .
That 's right .
I fell for your spell , and lost my mind .
You 're saying all the right words , but I still can 't understand any of it .
I must 've turned into a street mutt .
Once you take a step back from me , and think about it very carefully you 'll come back to your senses .
I don 't want to hear you telling me to get lost for the fifth time . I 'm going to get going .
Be careful going home alone .
You 're still here ?
What ?
There 's someone who wants to meet me ?
Right now ?
Who ?
You came .
I 've asked Joon Suk to bring you here so that I could see you .
Joon Suk is the kid who 's been asking you to buy coffee every day .
Gong Shil .
Do you ... remember who I am ?
I know you .
I 'm positive that I 've seen you in my dreams .
It wasn 't just a dream .
You were with me during the three long years that you were in a coma .
The sun will rise again , and I 'll be back by your side again .
Because ... you 're here .
Meeting you felt like a fresh ray of sunshine .
You have no idea how reassuring it feels to know that I have a defensive shield to run there when I 'm truly scared .
Master Joo , are you awake ?
How can I live the rest of my life clinging onto you like that ? I have my own world that I need to live in .
He 's someone who can see and hear the same things that I do ?
I was the one who discovered you out there in the woods .
Because your spirit came and told me where you were .
During the whole time you were lying in a coma in the hospital ... your spirit never went back to your body .
We stayed together for three whole years .
I 've lived as a ghost for three whole years ?
Is that why I 'm able to see ghosts ?
I don 't know the exact reason for it myself .
Because I don 't know how I came to see them either .
Where were we during that time ?
Here .
You were with me at all the places that I took those pictures .
He 's telling me that I was there ?
Want to go back to those places ?
Then you will be able to remember those times that you spent with me .
There 's someone else in this world who can see and hear the same things that I can .
I guess you finally realized who I am , Uncle .
I didn 't know it was you because you 've changed so much , Han Na .
I heard that you went all the way to England to meet with my friends and ask around about me ?
Why did you do that ?
Did something happen between you and Hee Joo ?
Were you involved in the accident ... that caused Hee Joo 's death ?
Chief Secretary Kim !
When did you get back ?
I got my memories back while you were gone .
Let 's you and I talk .
I thought I was going to burst because I had absolutely no one to talk to .
- Come into my office .
- Master Joo .
Before we do that ... there 's something that you need to hear first .
What is it ?
It 's about Cha Hee Joo .
- Did you find her twin sister ?
- Yes .
And those twin girls ... are my nieces .
- Chief Secretary Kim is Cha Hee Joo 's uncle ?
- Yes .
Someone whom we 've suspected to be the twin sister has been found in close proximity to President Joo Joong Won .
Cha Hee Joo 's older sister ?
How interesting .
You 're saying that you suspect me of being the culprit ?
These are all the postcards you 've sent .
Yes , you 're right .
Those are the postcards that I sent to a friend of mine .
You were in every city that I was in .
Have you been following me around ?
Is that how it looks like ?
I guess ... but my uncle was always right by your side .
So , I can understand how it could 've looked that way .
Uncle .
Do you remember the emails you always sent me ?
Although I never responded to any of them .
You always wrote about where you were , and which place you thought was nice .
And the places you went which you thought may be of help in my studies .
I listened to him because it was an advice given to me by my only blood relative .
Yes , she 's right .
I emailed her every month to let her know what I was doing .
I was pretty sure she was reading them , so I never severed ties with my niece .
Uncle .
Although I 'm a little shocked to hear that Hee Joo was the culprit ... you must know there is no reason for me to have been her co-conspirator .
Han Na grew up in a very rich family .
There 's no reason why she would 've done something like that for money .
The Han Na that I knew was a very kind and bright child .
She would never have done something like that .
Hee Joo was always the dark one . And she was really greedy , too .
Why did you keep the secret about you being her twin sister ? Why did you hover so close around me ?
When I met Hee Joo ... she told me all about you .
That 's Joo Joong Won .
He came every Christmas to the orphanage with his arms laden with gifts .
I always thought that he looked like a prince .
I 've liked him ever since I was little girl .
Hee Joo told me that she never got the courage to talk to you . She always felt too shabby and pathetic .
I gave her the courage she needed ... but that love ... ended so tragically .
I became interested in you because you were someone whom Hee Joo liked .
People always say that twins share a very special bond .
I thought that you were showing some interest in me , too .
Then you told me that I wasn 't the real thing .
How disappointing .
That 's right .
You 're a fake .
But I 'll take what you 're saying right now as the real thing .
Since Chief Secretary Kim ... is vouching for you .
I 'll be going back to England soon .
Isn 't the statue of limitation for Hee Joo 's accident ending soon ?
I was going to give Hee Joo a proper goodbye when it ends . But everything turned into such a mess .
I 'm sorry for not having told you the truth sooner .
I came to you because I was curious about the boy who was involved in my niece 's death .
But ... I saw that the boy 's scar ran very deep .
Remaining by that boy 's side to help him heal his scar ... seemed to be the only thing I could do for the niece that I had lost .
Enough .
Please stop .
When you first started ... I told you that you were a recorder and an interpreter .
It seems that I 've opened myself up too much in front of those two things .
If you find it burdensome to have me remain by your side ... I 'll stop and leave your side .
Do that .
Thanks to you ... I was able to escape his suspicion .
You heard from Team Leader Kang , right ? That I 've been deceitful all this time .
I can understand if you 've misinterpreted my intentions .
No .
I 've seen Cha Hee Joo .
Hee Joo never once glanced in your direction .
I hear ... that you can see spirits ?
You 've seen dead Hee Joo 's spirit ?
Yes .
Hee Joo told me that she wanted to protect the culprit .
If the ghost is willing to protect the culprit ... then I guess it 'll be pretty difficult to catch that person .
You don 't think Han Na 's the culprit , do you ?
Can you ... catch the culprit ?
I really don 't want to do it . But I think I 'm going to have to grant Hee Joo her request .
Are you not suspecting Han Na because you believe what Secretary Kim said ?
No .
I 'm positive that she is the co-conspirator .
We just need to find the evidence and catch her .
If she goes back to England , it 'll all be over .
She came back on her own accord , and she even tried to seduce me .
She wouldn 't have done that unless she was sure that there was ... no evidence to be found .
So , are you just going to give up , and watch her walk away ?
I 've found out everything that I want to know .
I wanted to know who the co-conspirator was , and I now know who that was .
She said she wanted to protect her ... because Han Na was her older twin sister .
Is that going to be the end of it ?
Cha Hee Joo is dead .
No matter how much you hated her ... don 't you think that you should at least try ... to make an effort to understand why things happened the way it did ?
If that 's what you 're going to do , then don 't do it in front of me .
Keep doing it behind my back like you did with my father .
Leave .
I 'll do that .
I 'll leave Kingdom , and do it outside of this place .
President Joo .
I don 't want to tell you to get lost , too .
If you 're here to talk about Hee Joo , then don 't .
I 've got my 10 billion won radar on .
I keep getting Hee Joo on my radar .
Maybe ... it was during the moments when I was dead . I saw Hee Joo during those moments .
I finished reading that same book while seated in front of her .
And then I felt at peace .
I was able to read all the words that were written on those pages very easily .
Then ... does that mean it 's all over ?
I 've continued to see Hee Joo .
She was always standing next to that woman , Han Na .
Didn 't you tell me that Hee Joo wanted to protect her co-conspirator ? It 's probably why she remained by her side . Tell her to keep doing that if she wants .
I 'm not going to get my money back just because I go after her twin sister .
It 's just going to bring more things to light which I don 't want to know about .
But still ...
I ... just want to end it here .
But ... She was the criminal and I was the victim .
I said that I 'm letting it go , and just accept things for what they are .
Do I need to try to understand when I can 't even see or hear her ?
That 's why you shouldn 't ... look at that dead girl any longer either .
Okay .
I 'm not going to force you to try to understand things that only I can see and hear anymore .
You should live your life in peace .
This was just something that I wanted to resolve for you .
Your radar is useless .
Tae Gong Shil .
In the beginning , you hated the things that you could see and hear and you clung onto me as your shield because you wanted to escape from that .
But why are you starting to fight me on this ? Why are you trying to see and hear them more and more ?
When you do that ... I start to become useless to you .
But your life is more peaceful now .
The more useless we become to one another ... the easier our lives will get for the both of us .
I fought and found my way back because I thought you couldn 't be without me .
But , I see it was nothing more than a slight disappointment to not have me around .
This is unfair .
If I continue standing here looking at you ... I 'm just going to tell you to get lost from the injustice of it all .
You should leave .
Team Leader Kang ... are you really quitting ?
Yes .
I heard that Chief Secretary Kim quit , too .
Is that true ?
Yes , I think so .
Thanks ... for everything .
First Tae Gong Shil quits her job , then , Chief Secretary Kim , and now Team Leader Kang ...
What a mess .
Then who is to become the Team Leader now ?
I 've decided to go to America .
Okay .
- That 's good .
- But I can 't just leave like this .
What about it ?
Have ... dinner with me before I leave .
Do you know how many reservations I 've canceled because of you ?
Okay .
Let 's go eat .
I 'll treat .
What would you like to eat ?
I thought you 'd want to go somewhere that would destroy my paycheck .
But this is it ?
A while back you said you were going to bring me here to eat pickled radishes .
So , I wanted to check it out and see what the big fuss was about .
I took your status into consideration , and rented out the whole place .
Eat as much as you 'd like .
But now that we 're here like this , it feels a bit weird .
But it 's simpler this way .
Let 's pretend that we 're a couple from high school who met by chance and then parted ways after sharing some ddukbokki ... simple and fleeting .
Forget it .
Just go and get me some more pickled radish .
Do I look like a high schooler to you ?
To break up with you so easily ?
Let 's cheers .
One shot .
You have to knock it back like a black whiskered whale , okay ?
Okay .
This is weird .
I feel like I 've been drinking .
Kang Woo .
I don 't want to break up with you .
If I had just told you that I wanted to have a drink you you probably would 've told me that you don 't want to , right ?
Have I been drinking alcohol ?
I 'm not trying to be stubborn ...
I 'm just not a very good drinker .
Don 't you find me the least bit pretty ?
Don 't I look a bit prettier to you now that you 're drunk ?
Yes , you 're pretty .
Tae Yi Ryung is very pretty .
There are a few times when I thought to myself , wahh you 're really pretty when you 'd show up out of the blue .
Then why don 't you like me when you think I 'm pretty ?
Because there 's someone that I want to protect .
She doesn 't even know that I 've been protecting her this whole time .
Do you think that you 're Tae Gong Shil 's bodyguard or something ?
Yeah .
If she 'd just call out my name just once ... I will appear out of thin air to stand in front of her .
But , she won 't call my name .
That 's why I ... I continue to stand in the sidelines and watch her from afar .
I don 't want her ... to feel afraid anymore . I want her to feel safe .
That 's the only way ... I can stop being her bodyguard .
I don 't want to protect you .
That 's why I gave you alcohol .
Because I want to have you all to myself ... that 's why I 'm acting like this .
Where are you saying that you 're going to go ?
Here .
Isn 't this another country ?
Are you going abroad ?
Gong Ri .
There 's someone else who 's able to see ghosts like I can .
- He wants me to go there with him .
- There 's another person like you ?
- He really sees the things that you do ?
- Yeah .
I don 't really remember him , but he says he knows me very well .
Gong Ri , during those three years that I spent in the hospital he told me that my spirit came and stayed with him during that whole time .
Do you think Gong Shil ... will end up coming with me ?
If she were to come with me ... it would make it easier for her to leave that man .
You were there from the beginning , right ?
What do you think will happen ?
He might be more understanding since he can see the same things ... but do you think that you 'll be able to leave the man you love behind ?
If someone like me who sees and hears useless things remain next to a man who only does what he wants , and hears what he wants ... he won 't be able to live his life in peace .
You 're leaving much quicker than I expected .
If I was any later , I could 've missed you completely .
I thought you were going to let me go . Did you come to capture me ?
Did you really think that I 'd just let you go ?
You said that you believed me in front of my uncle .
If I was to capture you as the co-conspirator ... Chief Secretary Kim , who 's trying to protect his only niece , will be hurt .
The secret agent that my father sent to keep an eye on me is quite good so I was thinking of having him turn you over to the police .
But I 'm not going to do that .
Let 's you and I see this thing through right here , right now .
Give me back my necklace .
And ... get lost .
You seem to be convinced that I 'm the culprit .
Did that woman , Tae Gong Shil , hear something from Hee Joo ?
Don 't involve that woman in this .
Do you want to die and be reunited with Hee Joo ?
If that 's what you want , I can arrange for that to happen .
That woman must be very special to you .
Have you completely forgotten about Cha Hee Joo ?
Waiting fifteen long years to see you is proving to be in vain .
What was this whole thing ?
Were you trying to approach me again like how you and Hee Joo tried to do in the past ?
I guess seduction wasn 't your forte .
Even though you were her twin , I 've never once been interested in you .
Then I 'll tell you the truth ...
Joo Joong Won .
Cha Hee Joo isn 't the woman that you were in love with .
It was her older twin sister ...
Han Na .
I 'm leaving .
Help me .
I 'm sorry .
My first love ... wasn 't Cha Hee Joo ... so it was you ?
Hee Joo could only watch you from afar ... so Han Na pretended to be Hee Joo , and started talking to you in her place .
You 're Joo Joong Won , right ?
My name is Cha Hee Joo .
Han Na was a girl who shone brightly as if she had the whole world within her grasp .
Ultimately , she got you .
The person that the dark and tragic Hee Joo had desperately wanted for herself . But in the end , she lost that too .
Hee Joo ended up getting very angry .
That 's why she did what she did .
I 'm sorry for all this .
Joo Joong Won .
Hee Joo , Han Na .
That was something that the two of you planned and did together .
Cha Hee Joo did that all on her own .
Han Na would never do something like that .
She was an angel .
Try to remember .
The girl whom you were in love with .
One of the two ended up dying .
You saw it , didn 't you ?
You witnessed the moment of her death .
But , which of the girls do you think is dead ?
Was it Han Na ... or Hee Joo ?
Who are you ?
- Are you Cha Hee Joo ?
- I told you , I 'm sweet Han Na .
It was that bitch , Cha Hee Joo , who died .
That 's the truth you 've known for the past 15 years , isn 't it ?
You said that the dead girl was a bitch .
It would be too much of a tragedy if it was the nice girl that had died .
You 're ...
Cha Hee Joo , aren 't you ?
Cha Hee Joo is going to die here .
If not , then I 'm going to kill Joo Joong Won .
Please . I need you to die as Cha Hee Joo .
I told you that I 'm ... the nice and sweet Han Na .
I 'm the same Han Na whom you used to be in love with .
That 's why I 've returned to you .
I thought that once I 've returned ...
you 'd fall in love with me again .
But you already got another woman stuck by your side .
No , you 're not it . - You 're a fake .
- Why are you acting like this now ?
You were too involved in your own scars that you never once tried to find out or understand why that girl ended up dying .
If you just keep on believing the truth you 've known ... you 'll be able to live your life in peace .
Are you saying ... that she really ended up dying ... because of me ?
That 's right .
She died because of you .
I 'm Han Na .
You don 't believe me ?
Even if you don 't ... there 's no way you can prove it otherwise .
Whatever the case ...
I 'm sorry for all this .
I 'm sorry for all this .
- Joo Joong Won .
- Joo Joong Won .
Cha Hee Joo .
What ... did you just call me ?
Cha Hee Joo .
It 's me , Hee Joo . The one and only person who knows that you 're the real Cha Hee Joo .
It must have been nice for you to be living as Han Na Brown in my place ?
What do you think that you 're doing right now ?
I borrowed this woman 's body because I wanted to talk to you face to face .
This is absurd .
Get away from me .
You don 't believe me ?
Should I tell you what the last words you said to me ?
'Cha Hee Joo is going to die here . '
'If not , I 'm going to kill Joo Joong Won . '
'Please .
I need you to die as Cha Hee Joo . '
I died as you , and I allowed you to live as me .
Why have you come back , Hee Joo ?
Are you ... really Han Na ?
I stole this woman 's body so that I could come see you .
Hee Joo . Should we leave together ?
Cha Hee Joo stole Han Na Brown 's life ... but I can come back to life again by stealing this woman 's life .
I died because of you .
Isn 't that right ?
You can bring me back to life again .
Help me .
We 're sisters .
Okay .
Let 's leave together .
Just like how Cha Hee Joo has been living as Han Na Brown ... you can live your life as Tae Gong Shil .
I 'll help you .
And we 'll never come near Joo Joong Won again .
This is great .
Because I really didn 't like seeing that woman by his side .
Once that woman disappears ...
Joo Joong Won will be alone .
The rumor about Joo Joong Won being cursed by Cha Hee Joo ... I 've always liked that rumor .
I guess I 'll be leaving him behind with another curse .
Don 't run away just because you 're afraid . That 's humiliating .
You could 've just stayed away , and never come back .
You could 've also just left without telling him anything .
So , why did you tell him everything ?
Did you want to torment Joong Won ?
I thought that I could have him if I came back as Han Na .
But he told me that I was a fake .
He recognized that you weren 't the girl that he was in love with .
I know .
I 'm not Han Na , whom he was in love with .
What is it ?
We 're in middle of an operation .
Joong Won doesn 't know who you really are .
I know .
Because he 's never met the real Cha Hee Joo .
But my name will forever remain in his heart as his curse .
Cha Hee Joo .
Yes , it is you .
That 's right .
Since I 'm the real Cha Hee Joo .
Han Na ...
I heard that you said you wanted to protect me ?
Let 's go , Han Na .
I 'll protect you .
The late Han Na said she wanted to protect Hee Joo , who 's still living .
Even though she 's been unfairly framed , and getting shafted on the deal .
In other words ... it 's all about sacrifice , devotion , and love .
But even at the end , you never realized that , Cha Hee Joo .
You . You 're not Han Na , are you ?
- You dared to deceive me ?
- You caused Han Na 's death .
And you deceived everyone .
You did all that . Didn 't you , Cha Hee Joo ?
There 's no evidence to support your story .
Hee Joo .
You left something ... besides the girl who lost her life .
Luckily , we still have two days left until the statute of limitation is up .
Cha Hee Joo .
What I really stole ... isn 't this necklace , but it was Han Na 's life .
But no one knows that .
I 'm sorry for all this , Han Na .
My older twin sister .
Hee Joo .
I will ... remain with you by your side .
It 's all over , Tae Gong Shil .
It really is all over .
Um , Hee Joo ...
I mean , Han Na says there 's one last message that she 'd like for me to pass along .
You have something you 'd like to say to her too , don 't you ?
Joong Won .
I hope that I no longer ... remain as a source of pain to you .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry for having hated you without knowing the truth .
I 'm sorry .
Why are you crying ?
I 'm crying for you in your place since you 're not good at crying .
My ten billion won radar .
That was a huge thing you just did .
Let 's go .
I 'll treat you .
I 'm ... leaving .
I feel so much better now that I was able to resolve Cha Hee Joo 's case before I leave .
It 's a relief to know that I wasn 't completely useless to you .
Leave ? Leave to go where ?
I 've met someone who can see and hear the same things that I do .
I told that person that we 'll be leaving somewhere together .
When you came to see me as a spirit ... you told me that I shone brightly as the sun .
I think ... that I 'm a sun that should only shine brightly for those who are dead .
I just ... want to shine brightly and be popular only amongst the ghosts .
But when I 'm with you ... I feel like I 'm an unlucky sun who makes people die ... and it makes me fear and hate myself .
So , it 's not just that you 're slightly disappointed when I 'm not around ... but I actually make you fear and hate yourself ?
I don 't want to remain by your side only to become that kind of a sun .
Please tell me to just get lost and out of your life now .
The only reason why I was able to ... tell you to get lost all this time without any fear ... was because I knew without a doubt ... that you 'd come back to me and rise again as the sun in my life .
I 'll give it a try ... and do as you wish me to do .
Get lost ... my sun .
If the sun walks out of my life like this ... it 's ... going to destroy me .
I thought I was seeing things because I was so shocked . But , Tae Gong Shil ... it is you .
I 'm shocked , too .
For a moment , I thought I was seeing a ghost .
Is your radar still on ?
Do you still see ghosts ?
Are you here with a ghost ?
Were you having a drink with your ghost friend ?
This isn 't how I wanted to see you again .
There is no ghost . I can 't see them anymore .
- Seriously ?
- Yes .
So , let 's stop talking about ghosts .
Have you been well ?
For someone who 's so curious about how I 've been doing , you don 't even call ... and leaves our meeting to mere coincidence ?
I 've been curious , I 've thought of you often .
I 've been debating whether or not I should go and pay you a visit .
So , you 've had the luxury to ponder about coming to see me ?
I 've been doing well .
I 've traveled to quite a few different places overseas .
I 've changed .
I can see that you 've changed .
President Joo .
Has our guests from Sejin Group arrived ?
Yes . Ms. Park So Yeon just arrived , and her staff members are here now .
Please apologize to her . Tell her that I have a very important meeting to take care of .
Yes , Sir .
- You had an appointment ?
- That 's right .
A huge amount of money rides on this meeting .
I can lose a million won for every second that I 'm missing out on this meeting . But , I 'm giving my time to you .
Is Chief Secretary Kim not with you anymore ?
He 's getting a bit older now ... so he doesn 't come to these outside meetings with me often anymore .
Sejin Group 's Park Seo Yeon ? Isn 't that the woman that you were briefly engaged to ?
That 's right .
She and I 've joined hands and we 'll soon open up Kingdom 's Shanghai branch .
I bet you 'll be making a lot of money while holding her hand .
You should be making your money , so I guess this is a bad timing , right ?
I 'm planning to leave for China next month and not to come back for a few months .
So , this is the perfect timing .
Although it 's nowhere near the scale of what you do ... I also made some money while I 've been overseas .
I 've made enough money to make some investments of my own .
I even bought a house in England .
I will congratulate you on your earnings since you 're bragging about it .
But ... do you really not see them anymore ?
No , I don 't see them anymore .
So , you were relaxing out here ... and enjoying yourself ?
Yes , I do take the opportunity to enjoy a drink once in a while now .
That really is something to brag about .
I 'm sorry that I can 't join you in a drink since I have a meeting that I need to get to .
Congratulations on turning your radar off .
Now that you don 't see anything anymore , it 's okay for you to have a drink , right ?
It 's not that you were hesitating whether or not you want a drink . You hesitated because you wondered if it 's okay for you to be drinking , right ?
No , I 'm fine .
I told you that I 've changed .
Yes , it would seem so .
I sincerely congratulate you .
Thank you .
Didn 't you say that time is money ?
This is bad timing .
Let 's see each other again at a better time .
Were you even planning on coming to see me at all when the timing was right ?
Yes .
I really was thinking about it .
I 'll be leaving now .
She says she 's okay now ... but she wouldn 't look at me straight in the eyes .
Final Episode .
Stop following me !
Didn 't you tell me that you died from drinking too much ?
So , why did you have to pick that moment to beg me to buy you a drink ?
Without having any ghosts involved ... I wanted to see him again as Tae Gong Shil , instead of a ghost detecting radar .
But you ruined everything .
Miss , are you okay ?
Should I roll the windows down if your stomach isn 't feeling well ?
Mister , please take me to Mangwoori cemetery .
I thought you wanted to go to Seodaemun .
I have to go to Mangwoori Cemetery .
But I need to stop somewhere and get a shovel on the way .
Do you know where we could get one ?
What do you need a shovel for ?
The tree root keeps poking at me .
I 'm going to chop it off .
Are you drunk ?
There 's no tree root around here !
Mister , have you ever been buried underground before ?
Oh my gosh !
- What ?
- Mister ! Mister , pull over and stop the car .
Tae Gong Shil . Screw the timing , and just get out of the car .
Is she your girlfriend ?
Thank goodness .
I 'm not going .
You can take this lady to go digging at the Mangwoori grave site yourself .
Let 's go to Mangwoori .
You 've been possessed , haven 't you ?
Get lost .
If you 've been avoiding me because of a ghost ... then I 'll cut you some slack , Tae Gong Shil .
My sun . Are you awake ?
You 're probably wondering ... how badly did I want to sleep with this man that I 'm dreaming this , right ?
Are you disappointed because you 'd rather have an X-rated dream instead ?
It doesn 't matter to me that the sun has risen already . Want me to help you out ?
Come here .
How did this happen ?
What am I doing here ?
You really have changed , Tae Gong Shil .
It didn 't even faze you when you used to find yourself waking up at a Mangwoori cemetery . Now , you 're asking me how you ended up here ?
I just asked you how it is that I ended up here .
I remember being in the cab .
You got yourself drunk last night and almost went to work with a shovel .
I followed the cab that you were in .
I grabbed you when you got kicked out of the cab for acting like a lunatic .
- Was I ... okay ?
- I wasn 't okay .
You tried several different ways ... to seduce me last night .
Mister , I want some ice cream .
I want some ice cream .
Ice cream !
I want some more !
No , you can 't have anymore .
If you have any more , you 'll get a tummy ache .
It 's going to make you sick , and you 'll get a big belly .
No !
What are you this time ?
Seeing how you 're sitting in that pose ... I 'm guessing that you 're not a dog .
- Meow ?
- Meow .
I guess the old cat that lives downstairs must 've finally died .
Get down .
Look at this kitty .
The dog that was here the last time ruined one of my couch cushions .
What would you like for me to throw at you ?
Chérie .
That 's my face lotion . It 's not alcohol .
It 's for your face . You can 't drink that .
I feel so lonely tonight .
I don 't want to be alone .
Listen here , Parisian .
You 're going to disappear the moment I touch you .
I can 't do what you want me to do for you .
It 's not easy for me to sleep with you while only holding your hand either .
Let 's just agree on quietly getting some sleep on our own .
No ?
Want me to tell you in French ?
No , get lost .
I 'm seriously going to lose my mind .
I can only endure so much .
By any chance ... did I get drunk and act all weird again last night ?
Tae Gong Shil . I noticed that you 've developed some new sense of desire since the last time I saw you .
It 's not like I could 've even done anything when you came onto me so strongly like you did while you were drunk .
It was really difficult to just sleep beside you while only holding your hand .
So , I just acted like a drunk loose woman ?
You were just drunk .
Anyone who drinks can end up getting drunk .
You were just ... a drunk Tae Gong Shil last night .
That 's such a relief .
I 'm sorry .
Tae Gong Shil .
Tae Gong Shil .
I 'll go get you some water .
President Joo . I 've missed you .
Do you still miss your defense shield because you still can see those things ?
No , it 's nothing like that .
I just really ... really , really missed you so , so much .
But ... I can still see ghosts .
I wasn 't able to find a way to live as a normal human being .
Is that why ... you didn 't come to see me ?
I 've been preparing myself to seduce you .
I planned on appearing in front of you once I became a really chic , normal lady . Then , I 'll have you fall head over heels in love with me .
And once you 've became completely infatuated with me ... that 's when I was going to tell you that I can still see ghosts .
I 'm already completely infatuated with you . Does it matter which order that happens ?
It does matter !
I didn 't want to see you again as the woman who needs a defense shield .
I even made a lot of money , because you love them so much .
It 's all ruined .
I 'm sorry for having been an inconvenience .
Thanks for the tea .
Hey , loose woman .
Once you 've spent a night with a man in his home ... aren 't you supposed to give out your number and ask when he 'll like to see you again ?
Isn 't that the kind of stuff that you 're supposed to do ?
What do you mean that kind of stuff ?
I 'm not a loose woman .
That 's right . You were acting too proper .
Now that you 've become so arrogant ...
Don 't be too arrogant and not answer my calls when I call you . If you do , I 'm going to tell everyone that you 're a loose woman .
Don 't call me .
I 'm going to be the one to call you .
That 's what I 've decided .
Well ... since you hold such an importance to the order of the matter I 'll try to be respectful and considerate , and go along with your decision .
- Can I text you ?
- Well ... sure , go ahead .
Thanks .
I 'm going to get going now .
Tae Gong Shil . Do your best to seduce me .
You have all my encouragement .
Fighting !
I must 've been fine even after I drank .
Yeah , I haven 't had anything come into my body for a while .
What a relief .
Okay , I 'll bring him .
Tae Gong Shil ?
Where 's Joong Won ?
I don 't think President Joo is in any shape to go exercise right now .
Really ?
What did Joong Won say about what happened last night ?
It 's so unlike him to cancel such an important meeting with Sejin Group .
I 'm not sure . But he had a bright smile on his face .
Don 't worry .
The way I see it ... President Joo isn 't going to go for another woman .
It 's been almost a year since he last saw Bang Shil .
Give him another year without her , and he 'll forget about her .
I think that you 'll find President Joo with a big wide smile on his face all the time now .
Smile , fighting . ( Bang Shil could also mean , big wide smile . )
For some reason , when you said ' Smile , fighting ' ... I don 't like it .
Since Joong Won isn 't coming , I 'm not going to go either .
I 'm not feeling so well right now .
You 're not going ?
Sometimes , you make me feel like President Joo is more important to you than me .
Of course , he is .
Joong Won is number one , and you 're number two .
We need to have a baby so that I can at least have one person on my side .
That was just a joke .
We can 't have a baby at our age .
We don 't need anything else but our love .
Smile .
Smile , smile .
I love you .
Honey .
Okay , Gong Shil . I 'll be home right after work .
- Is Tae Gong Shil back ?
- Why ? So , that you could go around blabbing that cheap mouth of yours again ?
No , since ever I 've been promoted , my mouth have become much more refined .
You know that .
Anyways , don 't go around telling a bunch of people that she 's back .
Because I 'll always be on Gong Shil 's side no matter what she decides to do .
Master Joo will go crazy once he finds out that she 's back .
There 's a rumor going around about Master Joo having a few screws loose ever since his sun , Tae Gong Shil , left .
A few people even witnessed him sitting on a bench talking to himself .
Gong Shil has completely ruined that man .
She should take responsibility of him .
I want you to take responsibility of me , too .
Why would I ?
All those countless number of nights . All those things that we did , and playing with a man like you did ... like he 's your toy .
This cheap little mouth of yours .
Why would you say that out loud ?
Now that your sister is back , you 'll introduce me to her as your man , right ?
Then you can come meet my family , and let 's get married before winter . You need to take responsibility of me .
Well ... Okay , then .
When we get married , I 'll ask Team Leader Kang to officiate ... Oh , he 's not my Team Leader anymore . I 'll just ask Kang Woo to do it for us .
And naturally , I 'll ask Tae Yi Ryung to sing the celebratory song for us .
Our wedding will be the bomb , and we 'll have celebrity statuses .
We could be like 'Han-Julina ' or ' Gong-Li ' .
You actually think that she 'll do it ?
There 's nothing Tae Yi Ryung won 't do the moment you mention Kang Woo 's name .
I used to hope for things to work out between Team Leader Kang and Gong Shil . But he 's now completely head over heels for the ' Little Sun ' , isn 't he ?
But once Kang Woo finds out that Tae Gong Shil is back ... do you think that his feelings for her will come back and he 'll go back to her ?
That worries me a bit .
Why would you worry about that ?
Here , eat this .
It 's sweet .
Just like you .
That Tae Yi Ryung . She 's turned her manager into a paparazzi .
Look at what we have here .
Why is this woman being so clingy with the bodyguard ?
Why are all the wives of foreign diplomats so pretty ?
Why did you take those pictures ?
It 's me , Kang Woo .
Yi Ryung 's manager ?
Hey , ' Dog Manners ' .
You should stop working for the diplomats , and work for a bunch of old men instead .
Hey , ' Black Whiskered Whale ' .
Are you trying to get rid of every single woman around me ?
That 's right .
I still haven 't been reassured that I 'm the only woman in your life .
You always pick a desolate place like this to see me whenever I ask you to meet me .
Of course , I 'd feel nervous and insecure .
That 's because you 're Tae Yi Ryung .
This is my way of protecting you .
Kang Woo .
Did you just say that you 're protecting me ?
You said you 're protecting me , right ?
- What ?
- That means ... That means that your heart now belongs to me .
Black whiskered whales are so clueless .
It 's disappointing that you just noticed now that when you 've had my heart for a while .
Tell me for sure .
If you 're serious ... come with me to see a movie .
A movie ?
- We 've already been to the movies together .
- Not an empty theater at night .
I 'm talking about going to a film festival .
A film festival ?
I want us to walk down the red carpet together . Arm in arm like this . I want you to come with me to see the movie .
That way , I can show everyone in this world that you 're mine , and you belong to me .
You 're too much for me , ' Black Whiskered Whale ' .
Red carpet is overdoing it .
It 's a road that you need to travel down if you 're going to keep protecting me .
Because I 'm someone who needs to stand on that road .
Can 't you stand beside me on that road ?
That 's right . I forgot that 's what it meant to stand beside you .
But ... I don 't know if standing on a road that I 'm not meant to stand on ... is going to enable me to continue to protect you .
Come with me ... please ?
I told you that you should just come live with me at my house .
Why do you insist on coming back here ?
I went around and checked out a bunch of different places before I got this place and this is where I feel the most comfortable .
Do you ... still see things ?
I thought you couldn 't see them anymore after your travels with Yoo Jin Woo .
No , that didn 't happen .
But I finally know how I ended up being this way .
Where is he right now ?
He 's still traveling abroad , but he 'll be back in Korea soon .
You 're not going to leave again , are you ?
No , I 'm going to stay here .
- Gong Ri , I 'm going to buy this building . - What ?
You told me you made some money , but you really made that much money ? While I was in Europe ...
I was staying at this place that was just crawling with ghosts . I talked to all the ghosts living there , and I got them to leave . Once they left , I fixed up the place and sold it , and made a huge profit .
Why would you come back to live here if you made that kind of money ?
Because I feel the most comfortable here , and I think it 's a good spot for my studies .
And someone once told me that he 'd give me a chance if I owned this building .
Is the owner interested in selling ?
The ownership of that apartment building changed hands this past year .
When I made the offer to buy them out , they did consent to meeting with you .
Really ?
You don 't think that they 'd ask for too much , do you ?
I 'm not sure .
There he is now .
- Chief Secretary Kim !
- Long time no see , Ms. Tae .
You 're looking as bright as ever .
- But , what are you doing here ?
- The apartment building that you want ... I 'm here as a representative for the owner .
Then the new owner of that building ...
That 's right . I bought that building .
It 's on a piece of land that K Group and L Group will be developing together so it 's a goldmine of a property .
You ignored all the texts I sent you asking you when you were going to call me . But you 're here wanting to know what the selling price for the building is ?
So if I want to buy the building ... you 're telling me that I 'd have to pay you a quite a bit of money ?
It 's just a figure of speech .
When are you going to call me ?
I thought I would be able to pick up the building at the market price value .
I 'm a little short on the money .
You 're not by any chance thinking of going back abroad to make more money , are you ?
Instead of doing that ... you have the number to the man who owns the building in your phone . Just give that man a call .
If you talk to him sweetly , he may lower the price for you .
I happen to know that man very well , and he 's a total softie .
I 'm not going to call you yet .
Figure out how much more you want for the building and have Chief Secretary Kim call me .
I 'll be going now .
Respond to the texts that I sent you . Okay .
When you bought that building ... didn 't you say it was because someone told you that the rooftop of that building was the best in the city ?
My first reason was to make money off the property .
And I thought that once someone returned she 'd like that place better than having a villa in a place like Yangpyung ... so that was my second reason .
So , Ms. Tae has not decided on whether she wants to remain by your side yet ?
No , she 's made her decision .
But she said that the order was all wrong .
But respecting her wishes is very difficult .
You 've never been very good at following orders , have you ?
I never thought that you were someone who waited around when you wanted something .
Yes ... that 's how I used to be .
Is it okay if I go back to being myself ?
You asked me to advise you .
It 's okay for you to push her along .
Bravo .
Do you have the test result from my checkup ?
Yes .
I haven 't been feeling very well lately .
I 'm prepared to hear that the results may not be very good . But I really hope that it 's not a terminal illness or anything .
Please tell me .
Madame . You 're pregnant .
You 're five weeks along . Congratulations .
I am ?
I 'm pregnant ... at this age ?
I thought that I was told that I could never get pregnant .
But I 'm pregnant at my age ?
You 're a bit older , and you do have a history of miscarrying . So , you 'll have to remain very cautious in order to have this baby .
I 'm not sure if I have the confidence to do all that at my age .
The more difficult the pregnancy , the more the mother has to be cautious ...
Or what ? Will I lose the baby ?
I heard that you were at the hospital ?
Were the test result of your checkup ... not good ?
No , they told me that I 'm fine .
There 's nothing wrong .
That 's such a relief to hear .
Then , we 'll still be able to go on our five year anniversary trip ?
Do you ... have a lot of physical activities planned for the trip ?
Yes , of course ! It should be a lot of fun .
We can pilot a small plane , and go horseback riding in Mongolia .
I 've made sure to include all the activities that you love for the whole entire trip .
It sounds ... thrilling and a bit dangerous .
What is it ?
Do you not want to go ?
No .
I want to live the rest of my life freely with just the two of us .
Honey .
I love you .
All my plans keeps going awry .
Mister .
You 're still here .
Long time no see .
Have you been well ?
Tae Gong Shil !
Mister , we weren 't talking just now , okay ?
You have to pretend that you never saw me .
What is it ?
Want to negotiate the building price ?
Over a shared meal ?
- I already had my lunch .
- Really ?
Then we can go pass some time first , and have dinner together later .
I told my sister that I 'd have dinner with her tonight .
I have a lot of people who want to eat with me , too .
You know that my aunt is constantly trying to fix me up with women , don 't you ?
I 've been swamped with dinner invitations lately .
But ... you 're just going to leave me be ?
So ... then how many of those dinner invitations have you accepted ?
This is the first personal question you 've asked .
I wonder what I should say for you to react strongly to it .
So you have gone on some dinner dates . I knew it .
You did tell me that you were joining hands with that Sejin Group woman to go to China together , right ?
It worries you , doesn 't it ?
That 's why this isn 't the time to be worrying about some silly order right now .
Just forget about your order , and just lure me in .
Call me , and I 'll come to you .
Did I tell you anything while I was drunk ?
That 's right .
You told me everything that I really liked hearing .
I don 't care ... whether that man is sitting there or not .
So , you knew ... that I can still see them ?
Yeah .
Do you still ... hate yourself for being that way ?
Mister .
These ghosts are always interrupting at the most crucial times !
Why is he acting like that ?
He 's moving .
Mister , where are you going ?
Wait , you told me that he never moves from his seat from that bench .
Yes , I did .
Mister , where are you going ?
I have to get going .
That man is my friend .
I 'm coming with you .
Just as I feared , you and I are always surrounded by ghosts and their problems .
Mister ! Tae Gong Shil .
- It could be the wedding of your dreams .
- Yes , I see . It 's very nice .
It would be nice to get married here .
Right , Mom ?
That must be his wife and daughter .
I think they 're here to check out the hall for his daughter 's wedding .
I think you 're right .
Mister , have you been unable to leave because you were worried about your family ?
That 's not the reason ?
It 's not ?
My husband passed away three years ago .
It 's because of that damned lottery .
Lottery ?
He always used to buy lottery tickets using the same numbers all the time .
And miraculously , his numbers won the grand jackpot .
Did he die of a heart attack ... from the excitement of his winning ?
No , he lost his lottery ticket .
He said he accidentally threw the ticket away while cleaning out his wallet .
He said even though he was really disappointed ... there was nothing he could do about it .
But then he became sick , and he was bedridden for several months . On top of that , he 's always had a history of high blood pressure . And in the end , he passed away .
So this is where ... he threw away his ticket ?
So , that 's why he never left this area .
He still couldn 't get past his disappointment even in his death .
He says if he had gotten that money , he could 've paid off his daughter 's tuition ... paid for her wedding and his wife wouldn 't have suffered so much .
I can see why he was so disappointed if he really had won the grand jackpot .
Your daughter is very beautiful and she seems kind .
Your wife was bragging about how happy she was to be getting such a nice son-in-law .
All the people you love are still able to live happily even without that money .
Know that they 're happy , and it 's okay for you to leave now .
It is very nice , but this place is too expensive for us .
We can just have the wedding at the venue that Lee and I found .
But your father always wanted you to get married at the finest venue .
But if you and Lee are fine with it , then I guess it 's okay .
President Joo .
Allow me to formally introduce myself .
My name is Joo Joong Won , the president of Kingdom Mall .
Oh my ... I see .
Your late husband and I shared a very deep friendship .
To be more precise ... he was ... my savior .
- He was ?
- My father was ?
As a small token of my gratitude , I 'd like to help with your daughter 's wedding .
I hope that you 'll graciously accept .
Please book the hall for the date and the time that they 'd like .
As for the flowers , and the decor , give them the best of everything .
As for the dress ...
- Please prepare it for her .
- Yes , Sir .
Take your time and let me know whatever catches your eye .
Oh my gosh , this is all so beautiful .
This is so pretty .
Dad ... thank you .
I still see ghosts .
Does that mean that the time you were away was meaningless ?
You told me that you 've changed .
You seem to have changed your resolve . So , what happened ?
Yoo Jin Woo acted as my guide .
I went to visit all the places that I visited when I was just a spirit .
I found out that my spirit roamed to all those many different places with him . I also met all the spirits that constantly surrounded around him .
And when I came back to the living after having roamed around as a spirit ... I realized that I was still able to see them because of the promise I made .
All those spirits were left roaming this earth without any power of their own ... so I promised each and every one of them that I 'd relay their message along ... once I went back to the living .
The promises I made to them is what made me shine so brightly to them .
Even though I feared and hated myself for being able to see them . I no longer feel that way .
Because I promised them that I 'll become their brilliant shining sun .
I no longer fear or hate myself for keeping my promises to them .
You really ... have changed .
I even learned ways on how I can better handle scarier ghosts through Jin Woo .
Like holding my breath if I catch their eye , and they make a dash for me . Things like that .
He was able to teach me a lot of things because he 's been seeing ghosts a lot longer than I have .
I wonder if I did a good job being Gong Shil 's guidance .
Do you think that path she chose was the right one ?
Isn 't there anything that you 've realized after seeing Gong Shil 's journey ?
It 's time for you to go back now , Joon Suk .
You don 't want to go back because you don 't want to take the SAT , right ?
Your whole life is a test .
It 's not something that can be avoided just because you 're trying to avoid it .
Go back .
And you need to find your own path just like Gong Shil did .
Tae Gong Shil . You and that photographer only discussed your ghost theories , right ?
You didn 't feel attracted to your guide like you did to your defense shield , did you ?
But you went to all those dinner dates that your aunt set up for you . I didn 't go to any of those dinners .
Do you know how much I 've had to endure and starve myself because of you ?
Is that right ?
In that case ... want to go grab dinner with me sometime ?
Now ?
I 'll call you .
Hurry up with that phone call of yours .
Why aren 't you calling me after telling me that you 're going to seduce me ?
Why are you teasing me like this ? You expect me to keep enduring this torture ?
You should go see that ghost friend of yours .
Why are you talking about a ghost at a crucial time like this ?
Didn 't you say that he was a friend of yours ?
Do you want to continue to see him sitting on the bench like that ?
Since he 's your friend , go to him , and try ... try talking some sense into him . Tae Gong Shil .
You really have changed .
You 've become a master at playing me like a fiddle to fit your whim .
Call me !
- So ... you 've come back ?
- Yes , I 'm back .
Are you planning on continuing to toy with him ?
No , I plan to hold onto him tightly , and I will stay right by his side .
You 've changed , Tae Gong Shil .
Yes .
But you 've changed , too .
No , I haven 't changed .
I still don 't like you .
That 's not what I was referring to .
You have another life in your body .
You can ... see things like that too ?
It 's a very delicate life .
You have to be very protective of it .
Don 't act like you know what you 're talking about .
Don 't tell Joong Won about it either .
I haven 't decided what I 'm going to do about it yet .
Making that decision to protect something will be a difficult task .
And once you 've made the decision , no one will know what the result will be either .
Even after you 've made that difficult decision ... it 's possible that things could become even harder .
Embracing someone with love doesn 't always guarantee happiness .
Making that decision ... is that individual 's responsibility .
Are you ... talking about you and Joong Won right now , or ... are you talking about me and the baby I have inside of me ?
I 'm just talking about one person loving another person .
The living person who has to go on living while loving all the hearts of those who hasn 't been born yet , or who 's already left this world ... has the most difficult task of them all .
I will do everything in my power to help with your daughter 's wedding so stay till your daughter 's wedding , and then , you should move on .
Stop regretting over the lottery ticket that you threw away in that trash can .
If we 're going to be truthful about it , it can 't be as bad as my situation .
If I were to marry Sejin Group 's daughter , or any of those other women ...
That lottery jackpot money ?
That won 't even compare to it .
But you don 't see me regretting it , do you ?
Okay , fine .
I regret it a tiny bit . But I 've thrown aside all my regrets , and have moved on from it .
Because the woman I love ... is the sun that shines brightly high up in the sky .
Amazing , aren 't I ?
As a show of you agreeing with me , and complimenting me on my values can you bang the can , and flip the lid ?
The brilliant light that gleams off that woman ... you dead people aren 't the only ones who can see that .
Her light ... also glares brightly in my vision .
I want to get married before your daughter does .
Do you think that I can ?
So , you think that 's possible ?
But ... the one thing I can guarantee is that if you choose love , you 'll never feel lonely .
One , two , jump ! Yay !
Give mommy a kiss .
Giving a loving glance , and sharing a warm meal together ... and all those other shining moments filled with love and laughter ... will become your reward for loving someone unconditionally like that .
If I lose this baby ... I probably will never know what that kind of love feels like , will I ?
- Boys !
- Gong Shil !
- Are you guys moving ?
- Yes . We 're moving to a home that has two separate rooms .
Really ?
Your mom must 've worked very hard for the two of you .
- Are you living here again ?
- Yeah .
What about your special man ?
What should I do with that man ?
Should I keep him and live with him ?
- You can 't be without that man .
- I don 't think he can be without you either .
He can 't even read .
He can read now .
But , you 're right . He can 't be without me .
Kang Woo !
- Are you back ?
- Yes , I 'm back .
Have you come back to see me ?
No .
I promised the boys that I 'd help them with their move .
You can help , too . Sure .
Since we 've worked hard enough , let 's have a drink for old time 's sake .
Have you been well ?
I saw the article about you and Yi Ryung .
Being with her is a constant risk of exposing myself to a photo opportunity .
I can see how .
If you think about it that way , even the ' Little Sun' have to deal with a lot of hardships like that .
You have your work cut out for you , keeping her safe and protected .
She 's so pig headed , and always does whatever she wants . She doesn 't make it easy for her guards to protect her .
That 's why you are absolutely perfect with your guarding skills .
Tae Gong Shil .
You no longer seem nervous or afraid to me .
I drew every ray of light I had within my being ... and worked very hard to become the brilliant sun that I was meant to be . So , that I can return and stay at the side of the man that I love .
Do you remember how we sat here and toasted to you becoming someone amazing ?
It looks to me that you have worked hard into becoming someone truly amazing .
I 'd like to compliment you on your feat .
Thank you , Kang Woo .
You need to stay strong to protect our famous ' Little Sun ' , okay ?
But ... I 'm not sure if I can get up the courage .
I have to walk down a red path that I had never even considered before .
The thought of it scares me a little .
Even I , who sees ghosts was able to find the courage .
I know that you 're brave enough .
Here .
Thank you .
I looked up some more things that we could do during our vacation .
Bungee jumping sounds a lot of fun .
We can jump down a cliff .
The wind surfing sounds nice , too .
How about skydiving ? - Doesn 't that sound like fun ?
- Honey .
I 'm ... thinking about doing something very courageous .
Skydiving ?
Do you think that you can do it ?
Skydiving ... piloting a small plane , and horseback riding in Mongolia ... I can 't do any of that .
Why not ? You don 't like the thought of going away for our five year anniversary ?
I ... have to give birth to our baby .
Do ... what ?
In my fifties ... after five years of our marriage ... I found out that I have a five weeks old little fetus in me .
- Honey .
- Honey ...
I 'm old enough that sometimes I forget ... about your name from time to time . But do you think that I 'll be able to handle having this baby ?
I love you .
Since I have you by my side ... I want to try my best for this baby . Help me .
With everything that you have .
Little Cheol Suk 's mommy .
I guess it really was too much for him .
Kang Woo .
Okay .
That frightening red path ... I 'll travel down that path with you .
If you get scared ... you can just hold onto me .
I 'll hold tightly onto you ... and so that you 'll never get lost .
Okay .
- Here it is . - Thank you .
You are ... now the proud new owner of your very own apartment building .
President Joo didn 't come down on the price at all .
But , he didn 't raise the price on you either .
That building really is a gold mine .
You can trust me on that .
He told me himself that he 'd give me a chance if I owned the building .
So I meet the criteria now , right ?
Ms. Tae .
From the very first time I met you ... when I had to take President Joo over to your apartment building ... I 've always been on your side .
If you hadn 't stopped the car for me the first night we met ... I doubt that we would 've been able to make it this far .
Thank you .
Watching Master Joo fall for you ... has been like watching my own child grow up under the ray of warm sunlight . It makes me very happy .
Even if he continues to talk back , act brash or bratty in the future be understanding of him , and continue to be there for him , okay ?
Hey , French Lady .
Are you by any chance still here ?
Can you tell me if you think she 'll call me tonight or not ?
Should I keep sitting here enduring this agonizing wait ?
She 's calling .
Patience .
Wait until the fifth ring before answering .
One .
You took your sweet time , didn 't you ?
Have you been waiting for my call ?
That 's right .
Were you staring at the phone , and willing me to call you ?
That 's right .
- I totally fell for your plan .
- Mr. Joo Joong Won .
I would like to formally invite you over to my place tonight . Will you come ?
- An invitation ?
- That 's right , an invitation .
And there are some things that I need to tell you .
You 're going by the book .
Making plans and giving me a formal invite ...
Then once we make eye contact , I 'm supposed to fall for you right there . Is that what you 're expecting to happen ?
Yes .
You know that I 've always been good at formality ever since I started working for you .
Will you come to me ?
Then , I will formally accept your invitation . I 'll come to you .
Wait for me .
Ms. Tae Gong Shil .
What should I do first ? First , I should shower .
Shower .
Put on a little perfume .
Make this moment exciting , and stimulating .
Tae Gong Shil , fighting .
I should change into something more alluring .
I disregarded your preference . I prepared this moment to be very sweet and special .
You seem to be unaware of just how much I 've changed . Lately , I have started to love all the sweet stuff .
It 's okay .
I like it .
This building is mine now .
A self-made entrepreneur at such a young age ?
You 've accomplished a huge feat all on your own .
The price of the land around here is very expensive .
That 's very respectable .
Have a seat .
Here .
Wait .
There 's something that I need to tell you before I can join you in a drink .
I have a special ability .
Is that right ?
Once in a while when I get drunk ... just every once in a while ...
I can turn into someone else , or I can even become something else .
Don 't get too flustered when that happens , but just touch me ever so slightly .
I understand completely .
And as you may already know ... I might act strangely , and I might say some weird things .
When that happens , you just need to think of it as me taking a phone call .
Yes , if you receive an important call , you should definitely take it . I understand .
I ... have my own special world in which you can 't see nor hear anything .
I can get so immersed in that world , and at times , I will start to cry ... and may even get sad from it .
Even though you may not be able to understand me ... please just take me for who I am , and be understanding .
No matter what the relationship ... no one in this world can ever fully come to understand the other person 's world .
If I act ignorant because of my lack of understanding just take me for who I am , and be understanding .
I might make things difficult for you , or become an inconvenience to you . But , I don 't want to be sad and lonely without you .
I 'm going to remain at your side .
Because you 're very special to me .
I love you .
I 'll remain forever at your side , and love you eternally .
My name is Tae Gong Shil .
I 'm your sun .
Can I rise by your side ?
Is that the main purpose of you inviting me here ?
Then , I cannot accept this invitation .
Because an invitation means that you leave after a brief visit .
I have no intentions of doing that .
I 'm going to continue to live forever by your side .
I 've never ... once let you go .
Because ... without Tae Gong Shil as the sun in my world ... my world would crumble and fall apart .
Thank you for not letting go of me .
I know that you 're going to go through a lot . But , I 'm not quite sure what it is that I can do to help .
Just remain by my side .
Once I give birth to a healthy baby , you with your youth can raise it .
Of course !
Once you pop that baby out , you can just leave the rest to me .
You okay ?
Now that I 'm here ... it 's not as scary as I thought it would be .
Kang Woo , would it be okay if I kissed you right now ?
'Black Whiskered Whale ' . That 's a little ...
I 'll give you one later .
You promise ?
It had better be hot and steamy .
There are so many couples here .
But how many of them do you think are truly meant to be with one another ?
I bet we 're the only ones . I 'm not sure .
I don 't know if you 're my true soul mate .
You don 't know ?
Give me your hand .
Can 't you feel how my heart is racing ?
I 'm not so sure .
We 're each other 's perfect soul mates . Can 't you feel it yourself ?
Yes , you 're right .
Since such an ability doesn 't exist ... I guess most people just walk on by without ever recognizing their soul mates .
An ability to recognize your mate even at the slightest touch ? That would be nice .
If that truly existed , you 'll never let go of that person no matter what you 're faced with .
Just like us .
Kingdom ? Are you the president of that place ?
- Did you feel that shock ?
- No .
I felt a really strong shock when we just touched .
It was really strong , wasn 't it ?
It 's possible that it was my ability to see the ghosts that enabled me to recognize how special you are to me at a first glance . And thus , I was to able to grab onto you .
It 's a very helpful skill .
What would we ever have done if you couldn 't see ghosts ? Okay .
We 're all set now .
Let 's move on to the next course .
Do we really have to go all the way out to the ocean just to see the sun rise ?
The sun rises all over the earth .
Even if we are not able to see it , but the sun is rising over some land right now .
So , why we have to go so far just to see it ?
What the heck ?
You 're the one who asked me to rise as the sun in your life . How can you sound so crass about it ?
Don 't sound so brazen when you haven 't risen in my world for the past year .
It 's your duty to continue your effort to entice me .
Entice me right here , and right now .
I do have something that I 've prepared to help me entice you .
Okay , just one more .
This is the end of where I remain patient and follow your lead .
From now on , I 'm going to do as I please .
The thing is ... when I was in America I saw Steve Jobs , whom you 've wanted me to meet .
Are you serious ?
- Did you get to talk to him ?
- Yes .
If that man was alive ... I bet the sun would be rising a little differently .
Tell me all the details . What else ?
I 'm not supposed to tell you this .
Because the future is for the living to create .
But I 'm special .
You can just tell me .
- No , I can 't .
- Fine , forget it . Okay , fine .
Since you 're so special .
Okay , the thing is ...
Steve Jobs told me ...
Are you serious ?
And ...
Jobs told you that ?
You can 't tell anyone , okay ?
Of course .
- And ... no , I can 't tell you anymore .
- Then I 'm going home .
- Come on , tell me !
- No , I can 't !
Then should I use force ?
Busier than usual here tonight .
This is why we should never leave the house .
You said parking meters were why we should never leave the house .
And birds .
And the wind .
All right , welcome to Team Trivia Night , a new weekly event here at Dolan 's Pub .
Great . Now it 's a nerd bar .
Per usual , we are embracing change with grace and dignity .
You 're no better , Ronny .
You practically cried when the new $ 20 bill came out .
Andrew Jackson 's hair looks crazy !
People are really getting into this trivia garbage .
They even have team T-shirts .
Oh , yeah . That lesbian team 's pretty clever .
You can 't assume they 're lesbians , Mom .
Their shirts say , " You 've Got Questions , We 've Got Lesbi-answers . "
All right , let 's get started .
" Who holds the NBA career record for steals ? "
John Stockton .
Also , all-time leader in shortest shorts .
Mm-hmm . Looked like he was playing in a diaper .
" What is Europe 's second longest river ? "
The Danube . Wow , Ma . You know your geography .
Well , you know your father .
Instead of splurging on vacations , he shows me documentaries about different lands .
( shouting and gunfire on TV )
What is this ? The Invasion of Normandy .
Still want to go to France ?
Hey , the History Channel never loses your luggage .
You 're welcome .
Hey , you can 't look up stuff on your phone .
Relax , nerd .
I 'm not playing . I 'm checking a text .
Ugh , what a night .
First this guy 's narcing on me , and now my sister and her family are coming for a visit .
I 'm sorry . I fear I took that out on you .
It 's just that , every year , my sister comes to town , and rubs my face into how great her life is .
I 'm just trying to play the game .
Hey , you spoke to me , sir .
" What Oscar-nominated actress played dual roles as the Hughes twins on As The World Turns ? "
Julianne Moore .
Oh , Julianne Moore . She 's the gal who played Mary Tyler Moore .
No , that would be Mary Tyler Moore .
Ma , didn 't Aunt Eileen already visit this year ?
Yeah , this is a bonus visit , because your cousin Rebecca is getting a doctorate from Harvard .
I 'm sick of Rebecca flapping her gums about Harvard .
Hey , Harvard , your school color 's not crimson . It 's maroon .
And Crimson 's actually their mascot .
They 're so smart , but they couldn 't think of an animal .
I can think of four right now .
Ever since we were kids , Rebecca 's been so competitive with us .
You really think Rebecca considers you two her competition ?
She 's getting her second degree from Harvard .
Sean can name four animals .
It 's a marathon , not a sprint .
Yeah , and I just thought of two more , smart guy .
And our final question .
" American poet Dixon Lanier Merritt 's well-known limerick is about what bird ? "
A pelican .
A wonderful bird is the pelican .
A wonderful nerd is the Ronny .
And here are the correct answers .
John Stockton , The Danube , Julianne Moore , and the pelican . Good .
It 's over .
Now why don 't you all go home and have your cats quiz you on state capitals ?
You guys , we got them all right .
Maybe we should sign up as a team .
No way .
- Ugh ! - Boo ! You know , I think it might be fun .
All right .
- Sure . - Let 's do it !
You guys go and have your fun .
I don 't see the point .
As always , tonight 's winner gets a $ 50 Dolan 's gift card .
- I 'm in .
- Great !
So , we 'll spend some time together , and enjoy some healthy competition .
I 'm gonna hunt you down and hurt you .
And for the final question in the Lightning Round ...
" What sport was developed in England in the 1800s and was originally derived from hurling ? "
( bell clangs ) Field hockey !
- Correct !
Come on , lesbians .
That was yours for the taking .
That 's game , and once again , the $ 50 Dolan 's gift card goes to The Smarty Pints .
- Yeah , yeah .
- You know , it is really great to see a family
- come together ... - Yeah , yeah , just hand over the card .
Four weeks in a row !
- Go , Smarty Pints !
- Okay . I hate to bring us down after our incredible victory ...
You were warned .
... but the dinner with Eileen 's family is coming up , and so , we have to go over our talking points , and we have to figure out how we can be impressive .
Ma , aren 't we impressive enough ?
Come on , Jackie .
Be a part of the solution .
So , let 's see .
What happened this year that we can rub in Eileen 's face ?
I got in the High School Hall of Fame . Nice .
Sean 's leading the pack .
Huh . You don 't hear that much .
Gerard got a new coaching job ,
Ronny and Arthur 's team is undefeated , - and Jackie 's having a baby .
- JACKIE : That 's right .
You can brag about that .
I will with just one tweak .
Instead of the baby 's father being six feet under , let 's say that he is six feet tall and out of town on business .
Mom , you 're gonna make up some fictitious guy ?
That 's insulting to Jackie .
Can I call him Pedro ?
I think she 's okay with it .
So , what , you 're gonna keep this lie going the rest of our lives ?
No , Ronny . I 'm sure that eventually ,
Jackie will meet a great guy who 's sweet and kind , and who understands that one weekend a year , he 's Pedro .
Okay , you look pretty .
Handsome , handsome , handsome .
You look happy .
What 's wrong with you ?
I 'm looking forward to seeing your sister .
I like Eileen .
You just like that she takes us out to a fancy diner .
I think of her , I think of steak .
That 's more than I can say about most people .
I hate how she always chooses a place that 's outside of our price range , and then insists on paying .
I agree .
Nothing worse than consistent generosity .
I know my sister seems nice , but you didn 't grow up with her .
You don 't know what she 's capable of .
It was a brisk autumn 's day ...
Please , not the rocking horse story again .
It was a brisk autumn 's day .
Have fun with your new rocking horses , girls .
Do you like yours , Eileen ?
Yours is pink .
The next morning , Pinky was dead .
We know .
We 've heard this story a thousand ...
The next morning , Pinky was dead .
My dad accidentally backed over her in the driveway .
And who put her out there ?
I 'll tell you who .
Eileen !
No !
Your own sister ?
Sean , we hear this story every year .
And every year , she brings it to life .
But killing my horse wasn 't enough , because ever since then ,
Eileen has devoted her life to one-upping me .
Mom , I 'm gonna put on my guidance counselor 's hat here . Ugh !
Not that hat from last year .
I wore that one time !
Swing and a miss .
My point is , Mom , every year , you tell us this story .
Have you ever thought of telling your sister how you feel ?
Well , let me get this straight .
Are you saying I should share my feelings ?
Yes !
Ronny , that 's crazy .
I hope you 're not telling students to do things like that .
If you keep this buried inside , one day , it 's just gonna boil over .
Not if you tamp it down hard enough .
- Way to go , Ma .
- Tamp it .
You 're an inspiration .
So , Eileen , Ray , how was your flight ?
Aw , terrific .
Just terrific .
Well , first class isn 't what it used to be . It 's so much better .
( laughter )
Oh , we know .
We 've flown first class .
Oh , Marjorie , that 's terrific .
Sure was . Four years ago , we were going to Florida .
I fell on the tarmac , so they had to bump us up .
Anyway ...
We were literally dancing in the aisle .
Really pissed off the stewardesses .
- Arthur .
- Sorry .
Flight attendants .
So , where 's Cole ?
Oh , he 'll be joining us here soon . You know , I don 't know if I mentioned it , - but Cole came out a few months ago .
- Mm-hmm . - Oh , great .
- Good for him .
So , I guess now you 're not the only one with a gay son .
Well , it 's not a competition .
Although it 's interesting that Ronny came out so much earlier .
I guess we just created a more open , accepting environment .
Well , we never assumed that Cole was straight .
We didn 't think it was fair to put expectations on the kids .
We just allow them to be who they are .
Aw , good for you .
( quietly ) : Damn it .
Jackie .
- Oh .
- Congratulations . Thanks , Aunt Eileen .
If you ever need any advice about how to raise children successfully , you give your aunt a call .
Well , Eileen , I think that Jackie already has a great example .
Yeah , Pedro 's mom .
Oh , Pedro is the father of my baby .
He wishes he could have been here , but he 's at a hospital reading his latest book to blind children .
Easy , Jackie .
Wow . How did you two meet ?
Oh , wait till you hear this one .
Here we go .
Through a mutual friend .
Oh , that 's not what I thought .
The mutual friend was Michael Bolton who Pedro had just saved from drowning .
That 's what I thought .
Oh , man .
Do I go for the T-bone or the Porterhouse ?
Well , Arthur , last time we were here , you got the T-bone .
Last time we were here , it was in the ' 90s , and this was an IHOP .
You know what , Arthur ?
Why don 't you get both ? Are you serious ?
' Cause I 'll do it .
Of course .
We 're celebrating .
Ray 's law firm just won another big case .
Eileen , it was no big deal .
Sounds like a big deal .
Should we celebrate with the seafood tower ?
So , Rebecca , don 't know if you heard , but I got into the High School Hall of Fame .
And Gerard 's a head coach .
Congratulations , you guys .
Little harsh .
So , what are you up to ?
Well , I 'm getting my doctorate degree in psychobiology .
Sounds like you 're getting it in bragging .
Speaking of bragging , our family 's a champion trivia team at Dolan 's Pub .
We 're The Smarty Pints .
Well , we 've done very well with the trivia .
No big deal , but we 're kind of a big deal .
That must be very exciting for you , being the smartest people at a bar .
If we win our next game , we 'll hold the record for most consecutive wins .
So , Rebecca , do you hold any records at Dolan 's Pub ?
You know what , you guys ?
Maybe for once , we could just talk and connect like adults .
So no records at Dolan 's Pub .
I didn 't think so .
EILEEN : Oh , there 's Cole .
Ah , terrific .
Oh , hi , Cole .
Hey , Aunt Marjorie . Everyone , this is Daniel .
He 's my boyfriend .
Hey , everyone .
Nuh-uh . Excuse me ?
But you just came out .
I know .
It 's crazy .
Came out on a Wednesday ; met Daniel that Friday .
Glad you made it through Thursday .
Everything just kind of fell into place .
They 're really happy .
How ... terrific .
So , how about you , Ronny ?
Are you seeing anyone ?
Oh , no . Not at the moment .
So no prospects ?
Didn 't say that . Oh .
So prospects ?
Didn 't say that , either .
You know , since you 've been out ,
I can 't remember seeing you with anyone .
So , how 's Chicago ?
What do you think that is about you ?
I 'm just selective . Really ?
You think you should be ?
Excuse me ?
Uh , I 'm gonna meet someone .
Oh , no , no , no .
Of course you will .
And you 've got your career .
You 're a guidance counselor , right ? Uh-huh .
You have the summers off , and you still haven 't met someone .
I 'd rather be a lonely guidance counselor than a horse murderer !
What ?
You killed my mom 's horse !
What is this about a horse ?
Okay , I guess we 're finally gonna talk about this .
It was a brisk autumn 's day ...
Sean . All right , Eileen , I 'm sure that you remember when we were kids , Mom and Dad bought us rocking horses .
No .
( laughs ) : Okay . Do you remember when you weren 't a liar ?
Oh , wait , I think I do remember those rocking horses .
Mine was white ... what was yours again ?
Dead .
You put her behind Dad 's car .
Marjorie , I really don 't know what this is all about .
Do you want me to buy you a rocking horse ?
I 'll buy you all rocking horses .
- Ah , terrific .
We don 't need your rocking horses , and guess what , we don 't need your free dinner .
Marjorie , two steaks and a seafood tower .
Don 't ruin this .
In fact , dinner is on us tonight .
We 're paying .
So there ! How gracious of you .
Arthur , uh , could you pass me the wine list ?
No .
And did you see the look on Eileen 's face when your dad paid the bill ?
What about the look on my face , Marjorie ?
That total had a comma in it .
A comma .
I think all 11 of us sharing one dessert
- brought us closer . - Well , we don 't have to deal with them for a whole nother year .
Hello , Marjorie .
Or eight seconds .
Eileen , what are you doing here ?
I thought you were flying out to Chicago tonight ?
Well , our flight was delayed , and you talked up your trivia streak so much last night that we thought we would come by and watch you break the record .
Or not . 'Cause we 're gonna play , too .
( chuckles ) : " Triv and Let Die " ! Damn it , that 's brilliant .
- This 'll be fun .
- So fun .
- The funnest .
- Fun plus infinity .
No tops . Damn it !
Can you believe this ?
She just couldn 't stand that we paid for the dinner .
She had to find some other way to one-up me .
Plus , Daniel cut his shirt into one of those gross bodybuilding tank tops . It 's winter !
And he 's totally pulling it off !
Okay , teams , write down your answers .
The two highest-scoring teams move on to the Lightning Round .
Okay , everyone focus .
We need that gift card .
We have to start rebuilding ourselves financially .
Okay , it 's time for the Lightning Round .
It 's come down to the Smarty Pints
- versus Triv and Let Die .
- Okay , I just want to tell you all , if you fail me tonight , you 're no longer welcome in my home .
Okay , this first question is about diamonds .
Oh , Marjorie , that 's too bad it 's not something you know about , like ... off-brand hot dogs .
" The largest diamond ever found was called the what ? "
The Great Mogul .
No , I 'm sorry , that is incorrect .
( clang ) The Cullinan .
- Yes , that 's correct ! - ( Cheering , shouting )
" Duh , the Great Mogul ? "
" What two instruments in an orchestra have the highest pitch ? "
( clang ) The violin and the piccolo .
Yes , that is correct .
- You 're so smart .
- You 're so hot .
We get it .
I 'm single .
" Which professional athlete was voted MVP nine times during the 1980s ? "
( clang ) Wayne Gretzky .
Although Bobby Orr is the best hockey player who ever lived .
Th ... that 's a lot of bonus information , but yes , Wayne Gretzky ... ( cheering , shouting )
Guess your PhD isn 't in sports .
No , it 's in behavioral neuroscience .
Yeah , ' cause that 's a thing .
It is a thing .
Oh , God , I 'm starting to care what they think .
Okay , a tough one for the win .
" Cheryl James and Sandra Denton are better known as what ' 90s musical duo ? "
Shoot , I know this !
Daniel 's cheating .
He 's using his phone .
- Don 't !
- " Duncan . "
Oh , no , it 's a text .
All right , carry on , Curly Sue .
You were texting Duncan ?
You told me that was over .
It is . It was .
Oh , so he 's cheating cheating .
Oh ... hot Daniel .
I 'm so sorry , Cole .
EILEEN : Don 't just stand there ... go after him .
Yeah , and tell him to put a coat on .
You stay out of it .
Mom , I 'm not going after him .
You knew we were having problems for months ... you still made me bring him just to show up Ronny .
That is not true !
Yes , it is .
What ?
! I 'm tired of the lies , Eileen .
We flew coach .
In row 38 .
We had to stop in Buffalo .
Ouch .
- Ray ! - And you wanted me to pay for dinner even though I quit my job at the firm .
If we 'd got stuck with that bill , that would not have been terrific .
Big words for someone who ordered a whole lobster .
Market price , you son of a bitch .
EILEEN : No , no , he didn 't quit .
They made him a partner .
I did quit ... because I wasn 't happy .
And now I can finally pursue my dream of becoming ...
- Ray , don 't !
- Go for it , Ray .
A magician .
Wow ! This ... this is terrific .
Ah , so I guess you 're really not getting that doctorate from Harvard , are you ?
No , I am .
Congrats .
Well , I bet you 're really loving this , huh , Marjorie ?
You win again .
Again ?
You 're the one who 's always winning .
You never let me win .
You have been winning ever since you got ... Oh , please .
What ?
- Nothing .
- Say it .
- No .
- Say it .
You got the pink rocking horse !
Yes .
And where did you put it ?
In the driveway ! In the driveway !
I knew it !
And was it or was it not a brisk autumn 's day ?
It was !
Marjorie , I ...
I had to do it .
I just couldn 't face the fact that you were Mom and Dad 's favorite . - What ?
- RONNY :
I just remembered that ' 90s pop duo .
Not important .
Go on .
Eileen , that 's ridiculous !
I wasn 't their favorite .
Oh , yes , you were .
I overheard them talking .
Really ?
Really ?
Yeah , one night I heard Mom say that Marjorie was " just a delight , "
and that Eileen was " a bit of a chore . "
And then Dad said , " Yeah .
If only we had two Marjories . "
Well , I mean , do the math .
That means no Eileens .
Yeah , I think that 's right .
Oh , my God , Eileen , you 've been carrying that around all this time ? That 's terrible .
Yeah , it has been terrible .
But you know what 's really terrible ?
I 've been taking it out on you .
Well , you know what ?
You and I are gonna get some beers , and we 're gonna drink ' em , and who knows , we might even ... talk about our feelings .
I heard that , and I approve .
- That would be nice . - Great .
Beers are on me .
Marjorie .
Here 's last week 's gift card .
Okay , while those two are learning that feeling leads to healing , we can turn our attention back to more trivial pursuits .
( clang ) Salt-n-Pepa .
- ANNOUNCER : Correct !
- RONNY : Damn it !
Well , I just want you to know I 'm done with Pedro ...
I thought you should hear it from me .
Who else would we hear it from ?
ARTHUR : Hey . How 'd it go with your sister ?
Good . We decided that we 're gonna try and be happy for each other rather than always be so competitive .
Good for you , Mom .
Taking the high road .
Well , I won , so ... ( chuckles )
But , you know , with all her kids' successes , Eileen told me that she almost never gets to see them , because they 're always out doing and dating and achieving .
You 're lucky , Ma .
You get to see us all the time .
I do .
There 's probably a middle ground .
No caller I.D. Who 's this ?
Oh . Hold on .
Dad , it 's the credit card company .
Hello ?
Yes .
That does sound like an unusually large expenditure for me .
Was it stolen ?
Sure seems like it .
Are you ok ?
Yeah , are you ?
This night was rough .
- Did you come to take care of me ?
- Is there an option ?
Yeah .
What most people do when they 're around me .
- Leave .
- No way .
Life would just be too predictable .
- How do I look ?
- Good .
You suck at lying .
But I 'm glad you tried .
Rise and shine , darling .
I 'm heading out for today and I might not be home tonight .
Really , Ashley . I tolerate your playmates , but do they have to be here in the morning ?
I 'm sorry , I just fell asleep .
You remember my friend Spencer , right mom ?
Right .
Look hon , I can 't leave you if you insist on bringing home this kinda friends .
- Actually I just came to take care of her .
- And I 'm sure you did that very well .
- Mom , could you please try and be nice ?
- Oh I have been .
To Paige who stole my credit card .
To Elizabeth who passed out eating my valium .
Then there was the one with the piercings .
She moved in and we had to have help to get rid off her .
There , this ought to cover you to get home .
Ciao .
I 'm so sorry .
It 's how it is every morning ?
No , that only happens once a month , when I see her .
Did you really sleep with all those girls ?
Those are just the ones she found out about .
They never meant anything .
That makes it better .
Better watch out , Mom and Dad are back They know you were gone all night .
You sound almost happy about that .
- You 're okay , Spencer ?
- Yeah , I 'm fine ?
Ashley isn 't feeling too good though .
Ashley ?
you were supposed to be with Aiden .
Forget it , Glenn , your stupid plan didn 't work .
Is it too much to ask for a phone call ?
Whether we 're here or not we deserve to know where you are and if you 're okay .
- Not to mention you missed church .
- I 'm sorry I spent the night at Ashley 's .
I didn 't think you and dad would be back so early .
Now we know you don 't go to mass unless we make you .
Sorry .
Spencer .
Don 't you see I 'm worried about you ?
Ever since we moved here , you 've changed .
What am I supposed to do ?
Stay the same ?
- Spencer , list ...
- No , dad .
You know what ?
Glenn goes out every night . And nobody says anything .
And then I go out to help a friend and get the Inquisition ?
A little double standard , don 't you think ?
- It 's that girl , I 've told you .
- Here we go again .
You know what ? Her name is Ashley , Ashley .
Why won 't you ever say her name ?
You want me to say her name ?
I 'll say her name .
- You are not allowed to see Ashley .
- What ?
Why ?
Because she 's a bad influence .
I am telling you , you are forbidden to see Ashley .
How are you gonna stop me ?
You 're never home .
Paula .
What is wrong with you ?
You 're on the edge , here
Don 't you dare make this about me .
This is about our daughter .
And this relationship she 's having with that Ashley .
Don 't you see you 're letting it drive a wedge between you and Spencer ?
Really ?
Maybe I should go away and you 'll deal with it , cause you obviously know best .
You do what you have to do .
I 'm sick and tired of following you and not really knowing why .
- What are you doing ?
- I 'm checking your lifeline .
I wanna know if you 're gonna be around for a while .
Get a room !
Since when did this become the island of Lesbos ?
It 's hard to get pissed when she makes a geography joke .
I wonder if she even knows what it means .
I know her evil minions don 't .
you know you 're right .
We 're gonna be late for class .
I 'm glad your folks were fighting .
Cause , I mean , it normals them up .
My mom loves a good fight with my dad .
She says it 's all about the make up sex .
Thanks for the image .
Now I 'll never be able to have dinner at your house !
I called her .
My mom .
I spoke to her .
You think I should go see her ?
Only if you need to .
With no expectations on who or how she 'll be .
I don 't want you to get hurt .
Maybe I 'll learn something . Maybe when she sees me she 'll want to know about me .
Maybe you need to tell her that you are a ... wonderful , talented , smart black man that forgives her .
I know it 'll help you whether it changes her or not .
Duke , that 's who that was . And they are talking of a full ride .
All I have to do is stay healthy and keep putting the ball in the hoop .
That 's good baby . Congratulations .
Good ?
It 's freaking awesome .
That 's the place to be . Their team is always in the final four .
We 're talking about national TV just to see your man shoot the rock .
Glenn Carlin , nothing but net , the crowd goes wild ... ahhhh !
Hey baby , I mean .
Aren 't you happy ?
This isn 't what you wanted ?
For us , for me ?
Of course I 'm happy for you . It 's just ...
Now I have to start thinking of what it 's gonna be like without you .
Without me ?
Long distance relationships are really hard .
I mean , come on , you didn 't keep a girlfriend in Ohio when you moved here ?
Right .
- Maybe you can come with me .
- I would love that .
But I don 't know about moving out there just to be with you .
Unless we are married .
Married ?
I think I should probably just be focusing on playing ball and school right now .
I would never pressure you , I mean , this is an opportunity of a lifetime .
I just think we should be honest on how this is gonna affect us .
If there is an " us " .
Hey , we don 't have to figure this out today
Why don 't you drive me home and we 'll celebrate ?
My mom 's out of the house .
I wish my parents weren 't acting like complete freaks .
Suspicious , controlling .
I wish I didn 't care .
I have a lot of experience is that area .
It 's not you , it 's totally them .
Parents are not rational people .
Something happens when you get older .
I think it 's hormones .
hey focus on you so much so they don 't have to focus on themselves and all their crap .
Thanks .
I have to go .
Hey , next time you get polluted , you need to let someone else drive .
- You scared me , man .
- But I 'm still here .
Black eye , ain 't nothing going to stop me , baby .
You must be high on your meds .
We 'll catch you later .
- Take it easy , Boz .
- Stay up , Clay , player .
That brother has to learn to think .
Just cause he lives now he thinks he 's invincible .
He Sean , I need to borrow your car .
I know you just got it , I promise I 'll be careful .
- Cool , just don 't wreck my ride .
- Thanks .
- You 're not gonna ask me why ?
- You 're gonna go see your mom .
What do you think ?
It 's not about what I think . It 's what you think .
See , you 're looking for something , maybe you will find it in that woman .
Thanks , man .
I just need some time , okay ?
I need some distance .
I think we ought to the kids to tell them what 's going on .
Okay .
Here are the club sodas .
I 'll just talk to myself .
Maybe meet 2 new girls to get messed up in the head with .
What is up with you , Ashley ?
Look , sometimes you 're pulling me close to you . And then I try to make a step towards you and you close up and move away .
Exactly .
Can you give us a minute ?
Sure .
I 'll be right over here if either one of you guys decide to straighten up .
Cute .
Do you want that life ?
Stupid little comment about what you are and how you feel ?
So I learned to laugh most things off , cause it hurts too much to do anything else .
You know what ?
I can 't just be your friend , Ashley .
It has to be more than that or I 'm out of your life .
I need to figure out mine .
What do I do about Spencer ?
Don 't ask me , I 'm the only one in the school not hooking up .
Yeah but you alone , this gives you a certain clarity .
What do I do ?
Do you wanna be with her ?
I don 't know .
What if I scare her away ?
I think you 're the one who 's afraid .
- No .
- Yes .
I know from experience that you 're the one that does the heartbreaking .
Maybe ...
Maybe you 're afraid that Spencer is the one that 's gonna break yours .
What are you thinking ?
That you 'd make a great girl .
You sucked today , Carlin .
You aren 't at Duke yet , alright ?
We still got games to win and a whole season next year , so don 't blow it
Thanks man , it 's just a bad day .
Yeah , I had one of those the day you showed up .
Funny .
But I mean , you still have college opportunity , right ?
Yeah I mean , I 'm not too worried .
Although I 'm not gonna lie , it was a lot better before you got here .
And I was better .
My life was a lot better before I got here too .
Not possible .
You got game , you got a hot girl .
You 're living a dream .
- Yeah , about the girl .
- Yeah I know , she 's a handful .
You know , when you two were together .
Did she ever pressure you ? To play better , treat her better , cement the relationship .
All the time .
That 's part of what makes her so ... hot .
With all due respect to a lady .
Hello .
Are you Mrs. Garrison ?
Yeah , yeah , Cecily .
- Are you Clay ?
- Yes .
I 'm Clay Carlin and I think I 'm your son .
Sit down .
So , tell me about yourself .
Well , I 'm a junior in high school .
Actually I love school , I 'm doing very well .
I live in California with my adopting parents .
I have a brother and a sister .
Whole family .
How did you end up in Nevada ?
Well , I needed to leave my life in Cincinnati .
You know ?
Too many memories .
Too many people looking down on me .
So I left school and I started working my way West .
I liked the weather here , so I stayed .
You wanna ask me something ?
Yes .
How could you just give up your son ?
What do you want ?
I was fifteen .
Fifteen .
I couldn 't raise a child .
That 's it ?
- Did you even tried to figure it out ?
- What did you come here expecting to find ?
You know what ?
I just thought I 'd find some missing piece to the puzzle .
Well you did , okay ?
I 'm sorry if it 's not the piece that you wanted to find .
- Yeah , this was a waste of time .
- Well it 's not for me .
Because I got to meet my son .
And I know I made the right decision .
For you .
For you .
It was right for you .
Over here , over here .
Watch it man .
I want you and mom to be okay .
I know you do .
But your mom and I might need to take a little break from each other .
- Get things back on track .
- You mean splitting up ?
How does that get things back on track ?
Maybe we 'll remember why we get together in the first place .
We 'll figure it out .
What about you ?
You 're okay ?
I don 't know .
Spencer .
You 're my daughter .
I love you so very very much , no matter who you are .
Are you expecting someone ?
Hi .
- It 's good to see you , Ashley .
- Nice to see you too , Mr. C.
Send him to X-ray and then in ER3 .
Glenn , can you move your knee at all ?
Oh God it hurts . I can 't even bend it . Mom , will I be able to play again ?
Honey , don 't worry about that . Let 's just getting you fix up , okay ?

You intend to do your majesty ?

As no one will dare to insult .
A few days later .
My dear countess : the king has decided to officially introduce in court .
You will need a title of nobility , that only I can get travs a wedding with aristocrats .

I have a very special wedding gift for you . Madame !
Now you are the most powerful woman in France .
I want that soldier to be promoted immediately ah .
Instead of doing your duty , ESTs again thinking about that woman .
And teach you !
Have you thought about how many times any occasion has deceived you and that whore ?
By decree of His Majesty the King , Armand de Foix grenadier promoted to second lieutenant of the royal guard .
A few days later the Countess Dubarry is presented officially in court .
I was responsible , personally , that people in a dignified welcome to the Dubarry .
Dubarry Down !
The people hailed the new favorite
His majesty can not take responsibility for the wrath of the people .
We 'll see if the people have the courage to resist my will .

I prefer entering the prison as delinquent , before my ill wife starve .
While the King wasted the money with their loved ones , we have to starve .
You do not have a piece of bread ?
You get bread , if I have to use force .
Complain to the king that the bread is very expensive .
It is he who keeps the grain importacin to protect their interests .
Perhaps the lady countess can give me some information about the whereabouts of Lt. Armand de Foix ?
Lt. Armand de Foix had just been arrested .
That woman , to ruin France , also finished with you .

In Gourdan house .
He opened his eyes to the king . Who knows how to quin to dispense favors .

FIRST ACT .
Quaker dictates his mail .
The good Madame Daughter has gone stark raving mad .
Why exactly are you throwing all these noisy newspapers at my head ?
Well , the vases have already all been broken .
It 's come to our attention that the daughter of the shoe-polish king , Mr. Blakpott , has married a count .
That doesn 't impress me at all .
I 'll buy you a prince .
I 'm so happy I could smash the whole house to pieces .
Seligson the matchmaker .
But he 's cross-eyed .
For that price they 've all got a little flaw .
Dearest Sir !
As the daughter of the shoe-polish king has married a count , and as we all know that shoe-polish doesn 't trump oysters , I request that you send me a son-in-law with a pedigree in accordance with my oysters .

Now you 've got to apply some powder .
Not on the face ?
It all goes on the other end .
Well that 's pretty odd .
We haven 't got to that point yet .
Someone 's ringing .
I 'm sure someone was outside pressing the button .
I 'll check to see if we 're home .
I 'd like to speak with Prince Nucki about a matter of the heart .
I 'll check to see if His Highness will receive you .

His Highness bids you to come in .
Don 't fall over
Your Highness , I have a proposal for you ... a charming young girl ... .
This tall !

black as night ... .
I go for blondes .
Then she 'll just dye it :
With that kind of money it makes no difference .
Your Little Highness !
My adjutant will look her over first .
Put on my suit , so you look presentable .
It 's now been 1-1 / 2 hours , and I still haven 't got any husband .

If you come to an agreement , wake me .
These folks know how to live !
Josef grows impatient .
Where is the good madame ?
In the bath !
- And the good gentleman ?
Asleep !
Well what am I supposed to do with myself here ?
Wait !
His Highness the Prince is growing impatient .
That doesn 't impress me at all .
The good madame in person .
In with her .
Smells good .
Good Lord he looks dumb .
Oh well , he is a prince after all .
So you want to marry me ?
Is that what you want or isn 't it ?
!
Of course that 's what I want ...
just don 't throw anything .
Don 't you want to introduce me to your father first ?
Since it 's such a trifle , we don 't want to wake him up .
On the way to the ceremony .
We 'd like to get married quick .
Prince Nucki , do you take Ms. Quaker to be your wife ?
You don 't even have to ask ...
he 's got nothing to say on the matter .
But didn 't I get to sit up front earlier ?
Yes , but we werert married yet then .
Tell the servants that I am your husband .
They wouldn 't buy it .
I hereby introduce you to my husband .
Well you see how pleased they are .
Go into my father 's bedroom and introduce yourself .
What 's the nearest route to Mr. Quaker 's bedroom ?
I 'll provide you with a blueprint of the manor .

In the course of the celebration , a foxtrot epidemic suddenly breaks out .
Not so exuberant ...
think about your family tree .
Oh bollocks !
Do you foxtrot ?
What will your husband the prince have to say about this ?
I could do with a wedding like this every day .
Every day pickled herring ...
that 's bitter .
Nucki is called upon by his friends to go for a stroll .
Would you perhaps be able to lend me a little something ?
The wedding nears its end .
I 'm sweating like an ape .
Everyone sweats as he 's able .
Whereabouts is your husband ?
I 'm so very happy .
Why did you get married then ?
Shame on you ! ...
Why you 're ...
I 'm so very happy !
What can be done , will be done .
Here are my rooms , there are your rooms .

I 'm so very happy .
END OF THE THIRD ACT .
FOURTH ACT .
Nucki comes back from his stroll .
My child , you look pale .
The Association of Millionaires ' Daughters for the Prevention of Dipsomania holds an official breakfast for young ladies .
... and so I say , in closing :
" Down with dipsomania ! "
If consulting hours aren 't held soon , the patients will sober up on their own .
The associatiors patients .
A shame about the sclönen schnapps .
Hold onto me tightly , my ladies .
Everyone out .
I 'll cure him .
No !
Alright then ... we 'll settle the matter with a boxing match .
Let go of me , my ladies !
Fight , fight .
So now it 's your turn .
Bring the gentleman to my car :
I 'm taking him on a private session .
Careful !
Put the gentleman in my husband 's bedroom .
The good master is still asleep .
Then take him into my bedroom .
Mousey .
Little Mousey .
Shut it !
Well if that doesn 't just take the biscuit !
I 'm telling the old man about this .
These aren 't my trousers .
Do you have any idea where you are ?
With you !
Well do you know who I am ?
A sweet little snail .
Do you know that you 're a delightful kisser ?
Well I never !
Please .
A pity that you 're married .
I have to get married too .
Do you know that you 're both married to one another ?
I got married in your name .
The real wedding .
NOW THAT IMPRESSES ME .
Buster Keaton in The Saphead
Directed by Herbert Blache Written by June Mathis
" The New Henrietta " was a Broadway play in which ... Douglas Fairbanks scored a major success in 1913 .
It was first filmed with him 1915 under the name THE LAMB . When it was to be remade by Metro in 1920 , ...
Fairbanks himself suggested Buster Keaton for his former role .
Keaton was then under an exclusive contract with ... Joseph M. Schenck who agreed to loan him to Metro .
It was Keaton 's first appearance in a feature-length film .

" Jim , you know more about a mine than anybody on earth - - except me - - "
" I want a broker - - send for Watson Flint . "
" If you say the Henrietta is that big - - watch me gamble on her ! "
Mark Turner had succeeded in marrying Old Nick 's daughter but had never succeeded at anything else .

" Your wife 's outside , sir . "
" Go back and tell her she 'll hear from me in a day or two . "
" I came to invite you to lunch . "
" I 'm afraid you 'd find me rotten company . "

Bertie had been in love for years and decided something must be done about it .
Nick 's ward , Agnes , was the girl Bertie loved .
He had confided this to his sister and his valet - - but had never mentioned it to her .
" Agnes has telegraphed that she 's coming home from school today . "
" Don 't get excited - --- you 'll have plenty of time to meet her - -- - the train doesn 't arrive until 6 : 30 . "
" What 's happened to you lately ?
Getting home at daylight and having a picture of Henrietta , the dancer , in your room- - "

" Is it true you were in that dreadful place ? "
" I was there because I love Agnes . "
" If you love Agnes , why didn 't you meet her ? "
" I did - - but she didn 't come . "
" Bertie - - you 've changed somehow . "
" I heard you tell Rose that you loved me - - and I love you , too . "
" I 've tricked you into loving me - - when you know the truth -
- I 'm afraid you won 't care for me any more . "
" Tell me - - "
" I 'm good ! "
" I 've tried my best to get over it - - but I can 't - - and I still kneel down and say my prayers every morning - - before I go to bed . "
" Bertie , who is Henrietta ? "
" I bought her picture - but I never met her . "
" Agnes , you 'd better go . "
" You 've got to get out and shift for yourself - this is the last check you 'll get from me ! "
" How can you be so cruel !
I love Bertie , whether you do or not , and I 'm going to be his wife ! "
" If you 've had the impertinence to ask Agnes to marry you- - "
" - - I suppose I 've got to give you a little more . "
" Not another cent ! "
" Not another word about marrying Agnes until you go to work - --- - and make something of yourself ! "
Poor Bertie- - cut off with a million - - moved into humble quarters at the Ritz .
Watson Flint - - Nick 's broker , and a friend of the family .
" I 've got to go into business like you and Mark Turner . "
Dearest Agnes , you wanted me to go into business so I have gone .
" I bought a seat on the Stock Exchange for a hundred thousand dollars . "
" A hundred thousand dollars for a seat ? "
" Well , furniture is way up now-a-days . "
" I want to show you an engagement ring . "
" You asked me to look after it , sir . "
" If father won 't let us marry , perhaps you 'll keep it to remember me by . "
" No matter what Uncle Nick says , I 'll marry you whenever you want me - - "
" We can 't now , Bertie - - we must make arrangements first - let 's say next Tuesday ! "
" Leon , we 're to be married secretly Tuesday evening - please make all the arrangements . "
" It would be a wonderful surprise for her - if we could only get it ready in time . "
" We must ! "
You can never be sure a woman will be on time - - even for her wedding .
" I 'm going to marry Bertie tonight . "
" But , Agnes - - you mustn 't run away - - we 'll have the wedding here ! "
" Get out one of her little white dresses - - and she can wear my wedding veil . "
" I 'll manage father , and send for the Reverend Murray Hilton . "
" I took you into business because Rose wanted me to and you 're making good ! "
" I 've given you power of attorney because I 'm going on a cruise Wednesday and you 'll be in charge while I 'm away . "
" Bertie and Agnes are going to be married tonight - - "
" Perhaps they 've locked her up . "
" All right - - let ' em be married in here - - or down cellar - - or on the roof - - "
" - - but I won 't see them . "
" I have called for Agnes . "
" I 'm through with you - - "
" - - and as for Agnes , she has disobeyed me - - "
" Now ask Bertie to forgive you . "
" We 're going to be married here ! "
For the Minister
" Anything else ? "
" I 'll put one in every pocket - - then when the minister asks me - - there you are ! "
" If I die - - promise me you 'll put these into Mrs. Turner 's hands . "
" I want Mrs. Turner ! "
" Henrietta is dead - - and I gave her my sacred word I 'd put these into your hands . "
A dying mother appeals to you - Have mercy on my little one . -
- The letters from her father which I send with this will tell you the rest .
Henrietta Reynolds
" I 'm sorry this blow has come , Rose - - I 've tried to keep it from you - - "
" Bertie , these belong to you - --- they 're from Henrietta . "
Bertie 's valet had planned a great surprise for the bridal couple .
Tortured by thoughts of Agnes - - Bertie hopes a visit to the Stock Exchange may help him to forget .
" This is a new member -
- Mr. Van Alstyne . "
" Mr. Turner wants to see you at Van Alstyne 's office right away . "
" Do all these seats cost a hundred thousand dollars ? "
HE 'S NEW MAKE HIM WELCOME
Knowing that the truth about Henrietta Reynolds must soon come to light ,
Mark has induced Nick to go on his yachting trip as planned .
With Nick out of the way , Mark sees a chance to clean up a fortune before his relations with Henrietta Reynolds are discovered .
" Mr. Van Alstyne notified you that I would be in complete authority here during his absence - - ? "
" I want you to sell ' Henrietta Mine ' until you have knocked the price down fifty points ! "
" I can 't accept a commission of that size without security . "
" Great heavens , Turner !
- - these securities belong to your father-in-law ! "
" While he is away they are mine . "
Bertie 's introduction to the Floor grows more and more informal .
" All they do here is knock off hats - - but I enjoy it - - it occupies the mind . "
" I 'm going out to get some new ones so I can play it again . "
The raid on Henrietta .
" They 've started a raid on ' Henrietta' - - you ought to be on the Floor ! "
" When I want your advice I 'll send for you ! "
" Mr. Tildon of the National City is here . "
BIG SLUMP IN HENRIETTA MINING STOCK
" Mr. Van Alstyne won 't return for a week - - and Mr. Turner is in charge . "
" Tell Turner if we don 't receive collateral by three o 'clock we 'll be forced to throw Van Alstyne 's holdings on the market ! "
" Thank God you 've come , sir ! "
" Thank God !
I was seasick- - "
" Call up Mr. Tildon - - and send to the Stock Exchange for Mark Turner ! "
" Mr. Turner hasn 't been on the Floor today ! "
" Mark Turner is responsible for this raid , sir . "
" Because he 's a cheat - I found out he was responsible for that Henrietta girl , and put the blame on Mr. Bertie - "
" I 'm sorry to hurry you - - but it 's two-thirty , and your securities must be in the bank before the market closes . "
" It 's almost three o 'clock .
There 's nothing on earth I can do . "
" You 're too late .
Flint 's on the Floor now , knocking the last breath out of the ' Henrietta ' - - and I can buy your holdings for next to nothing ! "
" Get the police ! "
" All the police in the world can 't prevent your losing control of the Henrietta Mine when the gong rings in the Stock Exchange ! "
" Sir , you 're insulting me !
- - and I demand that you stop yelling that woman 's name ! "
" They 're all yelling that woman 's name at me - and I can 't make them stop ! "
" Bertie , listen !
- - I 'll tell you something that will stop them ! "
" Every time you hear a man yelling ' Henrietta ' you grab him and say - - ' I TAKE IT ' ! "
It seems to Bertie that the whole Stock Exchange is taunting him by yelling Henrietta 's name .
" She 's up forty points and going like a rocket ! "
Van Alstyne 's Henrietta Pounded to a Pulp
" I 've been saved , Flint !
- - saved by a miracle ! "
" It was no miracle - - it was Bertie !
He 's the latest member of the Stock Exchange ! "
" He 's bought a cottage on Long Island - - this is his address . "
" I have been on the Floor of the Stock Exchange . "
" Why , my boy - - you 've saved ' Henrietta ' ! "
" I mean the Henrietta mine !
Now get dressed , because I 've sent for Agnes and the minister . "

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE
A tale told in moving pictures under the direction of VICTOR SJÖSTRÖM
At the camera
- J. JULIUS
Once there was a poor Salvation Army sister at death 's door .
She 'd been stricken with galloping consumption and had only held out for the space of a year .
When there was no hope left , she 'd gone home to her mother .
Waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had worked alongside the sick girl .
Don 't fret over those poor souls now , Sister Edit .
You 've done enough for them .
Send for David Holm ! "
Please don 't !
My daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life .
Now that she 's dying , let me have her to myself .
Sister Maria , why don 't you do as I ask ?
Send for David Holm !
I shall go find him at once . "
You can 't be serious ! Asking David Holm to attend to a dying person !
I wasn 't able to find him , but Gustavsson is looking too .
He 'll bring him here if it 's at all possible .
Poor Mrs. Holm ! "
03 p
It wouldn 't do for her husband to see her if he should come here .
The evening on which these events took place was no ordinary evening . It was New Year 's Eve .
Well , we 'll certainly know when it 's time to toast the New Year . "
It 's a spooky place to wait for midnight , here among the dead . "
You gentlemen aren 't afraid of ghosts , I hope ' ? "
Then I 'd like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour . "
" I once had a pal named Georges , who was generally a jolly fellow .
He came from a good family and had studied at Uppsala University , so he knew a bit more than the rest of us .
But a change would come over him on New Year 's Eve . "
Remember that it 's New Year 's Eve , the last day of the year ! "
Whoever dies on this eve must drive Death 's carriage . "
There is an old , old carriage ... "
It is no ordinary driver who holds the reins , for he 's in the service of a strict master named Death .
For him , a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth .
Night and day he must Carry out his master 's business .
END OF PART 1
THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 2
Wherever he goes , he 's greeted with sorrow and despair . "
There is no escape .
He must perform his forlorn duty . "
Though horse and carriage are always the same , the driver is not . "
The last soul to die each year - the one who passes over at the stroke of midnight - is destined to be Death 's driver for the following year .
Now you know why I 'm afraid of something fatal happening to me on New Year 's Eve .
And the odd thing is , you see , that Georges apparently died last New Year 's Eve .
Why hasn 't Gustavsson arrived with David Holm ? "
Come with me , David Holm !
Sister Edit is dying , and she has asked for you .
If Sister Edit wants to see you , you must go to her at once ! "
David , I can 't believe it 's you !
It is you who is to relieve me ! "
You should take me to the hospital in your carriage as quickly as you can . "
No living soul rides in that carriage .
By the time I arrive , it 's too late for a doctor .
You know full well that I am no longer among the living . "
But worst of all , you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime .
David , do you think I 'm unaware that it 's my fault you 've met such an end ' ?
If you hadn 't fallen in with me , you 'd have led a good life with your wife , children , and brother .
By tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behavior .
But before you leave , a harsher punishment awaits you .
Behold your brother .
While you were here , he killed a man while intoxicated , and now a long prison term awaits .
But we feel that you ought to serve the sentence in his place , since you and you alone led him astray and made him a killer .
Does this not make you want to turn from your wicked ways , David Holm ? "
Yes !
Only now do I realize how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one .
What about your wife and children ? "
Now I know how miserable they 've been , but I will turn over a new leaf . They need never despair of me again .
END OF PART 2
THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 3
No , she 's not ill .
She was well enough the other day when she left .
And here I thought I 'd come home to her with such joy ! "
If she had gone openly , I would have understood .
But to slink off like that , to let me come home to an empty house - that was heartless !
I 'll wipe those smiles off your faces .
I 'll find her and show her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core , like mine has now !
I 'll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife , during which your feelings of hatred and revenge grew ever stronger .
I will take you to a time a year ago , to last New Year 's Eve , when you came to this town , bringing such misfortune in your wake .
A Salvation Army station had been set up here in town , and it was ready for use on New Year 's Eve .
Keep your food !
I just want to sleep . "
Leave it alone !
It may be full of germs , and our sterilizing oven isn 't working yet .
Don 't you realize , Maria , how happy I am to help the first guest God has sent us ?
Please go to bed .
It 's been a busy day .
Let me attend to this .
Dear Jesus , let our first guest be blessed with a happy year . "
All night long she bent over the coat , never giving a thought to the germs and filth she inhaled .
By the time she went to bed , the icy chill of winter had thoroughly filled the room .
Was it you who mended my coat ' ? "
Would you mind calling the person who did this ? "
It 's a shame you went to all that trouble , miss , but I 'm used to having it like this .
Before you leave , I 'd like to ask you to visit me again next New Year 's Eve . "
You see , I prayed that our first guest would have a good year , and I 'd like to know if my prayer was answered .
Oh , I 'll be here .
I 'll come show you God didn 't give a fig for you or your twaddle .
The time has come to honor that promise before you take over here .
From you she contracted the disease that put her on her deathbed , and now she awaits your visit .
You possessed all that is most wonderful , but you lost it !
You cannot avoid the torment of remorse , just as you cannot escape taking over as Death 's driver for a year .
" Captive , come forth from thy prison !
Ye spirit that left thy body at the stroke of midnight , thou wilt relieve me of my office .
For a year thou wilt set souls free from the earthly realm .

THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE PART 4
It is Death , but he has come too soon . "
You see that I 'm not afraid of you .
I will gladly heed your summons , but grant me a day 's reprieve , for there is someone I must talk sense into .
You do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused .
I cannot approach the Lord until I have set it right .
The person I 'm waiting for is the man I love .
Do you understand ?
The man I love !
I would grant you that reprieve if it would avail you .
But you have no power over this man !
Believing he was good , you 've tried to make him mend his ways , but your hopes have been dashed time and time again .
It was you who enticed him away from his home and work !
You made him the drunkard he is !
Don 't let yourself be dragged under ! "
SALVATION ARMY RALLY
Run along and be saved , and I 'll be sure to come watch ! "
Why turn away so carefully ?
I 'm a consumptive myself , but I cough in people 's faces in hopes of finishing them off .
Why should they be better off than us ?
He 's merely amusing himself .
He 's not as wicked as he pretends to be . "
How can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man ' ? "
You needn 't worry about that . I 'll be leaving town in a few days . "
No , you mustn 't do that ! "
I would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again . "
Tempting as that may be , I still can 't stay . "
You see , little missy , I 'm on a journey throughout Sweden in search of someone I must find at all costs .
Who is this person you seek ? "
You 'll know that when I find the person in question ! "
I am the one David Holm is looking for . "
I am his wife . "
I couldn 't endure the life he was leading .
I deserted him .
I took my children and crept away in secret .
I moved to this town , for it was so far from our old home that I never expected him to come looking for me here .
You must take him back !
it 's his only hope ! "
" I didn 't mean you must make up your mind on the spot .
Only promise you 'll listen to your heart , and let us talk again later .
She had gotten the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world .
Just come with me !
A surprise awaits that will make you happy .

She hoped to replant in good soil the seed that had fallen among thorns .
And she may well have succeeded had it not been for ...
The doctor says it 's pneumonia .
And her resistance is poor , for she 's been in ill health since last New Year 's Eve .
Yes , that David Holm has been her undoing .
She worries so about the situation between him and his wife , but she mustn 't know the truth .
You might at least have the heart to refrain from infecting the children ! "
It wasn 't so easy to run away this time ! "
Haven 't you had your fill of revenge , David ' ? "
If only I hadn 't brought them together again .
His sin would be of lesser magnitude were it not for me .
You must grant me a reprieve !
I cannot die yet !
I must see him turn over a new leaf !
Just spare me a few minutes !
You know I love him !
I 've never loved him as I do today . "
Captive , ye of loving head , come forth from thy prison ! "
Come along .
We have no business here .
Those who are to receive her will arrive shortly .
You know , David , if I could send a message to mankind ,
I would like to send them a New Year 's greeting .
" I would like them to dwell on a single New Year 's prayer :
'Lord , please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped . '
Why are we here ?
Surely no one here is going to die ! "
No , I can 't go on !
I can 't go on ! "
I 'm sorry , but I must go away , and I cannot leave them behind . "
Please don 't be angry with me .
it 's not my fault . "
This will do , David .
It will suffice for the children and myself .
" Yes , David , I see what 's coming .
I 'm obliged to watch .
I will not shirk my duty .
You mustn 't let this happen ! This mustn 't come to pass !
Don 't let those poor , innocent creatures die !
" I have no power over the living .
Where should I turn ?
Should I pray to God or to Christ ?
Who can tell me where to direct my plea ' ?
I 'm a poor , miserable sinner , and I beseech the Lord of life and death !
I 'm not worthy . I 've broken your every commandment .
Condemn me to eternal darkness !
Let nothing remain of me !
Do what you will to me , my Lord , but spare the three of them !
" David , I see that I no longer need grieve for you !
Sister Edit is dead . I was at her side .
You 're lying !
No one believes I want to reform .
It 's hard to believe , David .
I can 't help crying too .
Lord , please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped . "

God bless you ... shepherd !
God bless you ...
Welcome and have a rest .
Dear me , what a man you are , square-built like Jánošík .
What ?
What , shepherd ?
Like who ?
Begad , like Jánošík who used to live here .
Jurko Jánošík did not know what was going on at home when he was coming back to see his old parents after two years of studies and distress .
Little bread , much work !
God bless you ...
I am exhausted after the long journey .
Could I have some water ?
Enjoy it . To your health !
Oh , this is our neighbour Anka .
Yes , Anka !
Pišta .
It happened two years ago .
Easy , easy . The kiss is hot you could burn your moustache .
Do not leave yet !
Oh no !
Through the scarf only !
Well-known cottages .
Jánošík 's friend and protector .
I have not seen my father and mother yet . How are they ?
Are they healthy ?
Dear father ! Where is mom ?
Mom , my dear mom !
The old Jánošík was not at work again !
My wife died .
She would not have jumped out of the coffin even if you came to work .
Fifty strokes with a stick !
Go and tell Jánošík they are beating his father .
How can you ? You , you !
It is good the monk is here , we can save on the funeral .
And he was beaten so badly that he died on the same day .
At the village .
To work !
To work !
Think it over and you will never have to work for your lords .
They chase him , so Jánošík hides in a cave .
Oh , mother , mother dear , A long way from here . I cry longing for you Want to be near .
Bless you .
Thank you , Anka .
No !
Do not leave !
I thought there was nobody to look after my parents ' graves . But you ...
Annie , you are an angel !
No , Annie , I shall not become a priest . The bloody nobs make it impossible .
You cannot run away this time !
We shall catch him and earn a hundred ducats as a reward .
An uninvited witness .
Well , you can fight pretty well , father .
I am not a priest yet and probably shall never be one .
This dog and Šándor took me everything and chased me like an animal .
Is it you , Jánošík from Terchová ?
Is it really you ?
Welcome !
I am Hrajnoha , the bandits ' captain .
We nearly forgot about that one .
Pay a fine .
Hey , there 's a grove up the way . There 's a path up the way . My father was a good fellow .
Fellows !
Here - Jánošík - our new companion - let him be our captain !
Long live Jánošík !
Long live our new captain !
Dear friends !
I should have been a priest but Satan crossed my plans .
Do you want me to be your captain ?
Well then , I accept .
I promise to be your fair leader !
As so far , we shall go on protecting the serfs .
We will help them in all possible ways .
Our will - our strength .
Let the serfs benefit from all our doings !
The lords take us everything - our properties , freedom , lives - we shall not spare them !
But remember , we shall not kill anybody !
Death shall not change anybody .
Long live Jánošík !
Long live our captain !
The walls in the Count Šándor 's mansion were the silent witnesses of the gentry 's wild life .
Not every squire is a good squire . The Hungarian squire is the best !
In the neighbouring domain .
Visitors are coming .
His nobility - Baron Révay .
Oh , what a pleasant surprise !
Well , Your Nobility , will you pay your debt at last ?
Of course I will !
Yes , I was just checking how much I got .
How many times shall I mention my 5.OOO guldens ?
I will put you up for public auction !
Is it still the old wine ?
Lo ! What wine ?
Well , will you sell me a bushel ?
To sell ?
It will be a present from me , sir !
Oh no , it would be much waste , I shall buy it .
Believe me , sir , upon my squire word , if the crop was in the barns I would pay you immediately . But where to get money now ?
And what about the peasants ?
Could they not pay your debt ?
What do you mean ?
Well , it is simple .
Each peasant will pay 5O pennies . Those who do not have the money will pay in produce .
The Jew will buy them and you will get money !
Well , sir , tell my servant not to get the horses until tomorrow .
Hereby we announce that our venerable lord and owner Count Šándor orders his serfs to pay 5O pennies .
Those who have no money , will pay the tax in goods .
Those who refuse will be beaten and put in the stocks !
Give me back my pots !
I have nothing to pay the tax with .
I could not pay you for your work .
Well , I shall mend them gratis .
After a short while .
Really cheap .
Did he pay ?
I am coming to collect the tax in the afternoon .
It was very good advice , indeed .
We are even now .
You can use my advice also next time .
Fellows , I must go down to the village .
And you , Hrajnoha , Take care of Baron Révay !
The serf cannot rest even on Sunday .
When will a squire keep his word ?
The daughter is alone , isn 't she ?
You will not work hard in this cabin any more , you will come with me to my manor-house .
You must be sensible , you will be well in the manor-house .
Oh , you are like a scared little animal . Do not be so stubborn . You will soon forget about that bandit !
Here he is , the bandit !
Well , so this is the bandit nest , isn 't it ?
But you shall not escape this time !
You coward !
Well , you will pay for those words !
At the father 's protection .
Father , help me . Rescue Annie from Šándor !
Dear son , what path did you take ?
Oh , Father , do not condemn me . You know the soul of the suffering serfs .
Oh , mercy !
Be a father to my Anka !
Jánošík took care of the poor serfs , helped them together with the local priest and other secret friends .
Evening at the parish house .
What Šándor 's people took , cannot be given back .
Here , Jánošík is sending you some ducats for the damage .
Meeting at the county administrator 's place .
Is the Hungarian squire not the master and lord of his peasants any more ?
Should we let these dirty bandits order us what to do and want not to do ?
Well , do you know what happened at the last county ball ?
Before midnight ... When everybody was having a good time ...
You rob from the serfs , I rob from you .
And each of your sins will be punished .
You let my father be beaten to death !
You took everything from me !
Remember , you shall not escape my revenge !
And we should take this ?
This is not a good order !
Gentlemen , I promise you to clear your county of this group of bandits . Here , Commissioner will give you soldiers .
The trap is ready .
Is his lover hiding at the parish ?
Where has the bandit 's lover gone ?
And you , foolish old man , give the bandits ' money to peasants ?
Your master will throw you out of the parish .
I have resigned myself to anything .
Well , old man , is there some wine for your guest ?
Hey , old woman !
Has some bandit fallen in love with you yet ?
What brought you here ? What can I do for you ?
I came to confess .
But this time you will confess to me !
Does the bandit come here often ?
He does not .
Why do you not bring the girl here ?
What for ?
What for ? So she can tell me where the bandit is .
I do not know .
You know where he is , too . Tell me , you old fool !
Don 't you know it ? You !
?
Jánošík !
For goodness sake , save yourself !
Soldiers !
Go away !
Away !
Come on , Mišo ! Come on ! Let the house shake !
While at the farm ...
Look out , fellows !
Prepare your pistols , get ready and follow me !
No , Jánošík ! We must not lose you !
I am the first to go .
In the name of His Majesty , surrender , Jánošík !
Eternal peace .
The verdict .
As the accused and his , already punished , companions , are found guilty , having been accused of many felonies : Arson , robbery and even murder , he is sentenced to death !
So as to warn others , the punishment differs from others and Jánošík is sentenced to be hung by his left rib on a hook and quartered after his death !
Let the sentence be carried out without delay !
Such was the death of Jánošík , the first fighter for freedom of the Slovak people .
Thank you , shepherd .
Take care !
THE END
Our story deals with one of those queer tricks that Fate sometimes plays .
Nobody would believe , for instance , that the entire lives of a peaceful American boy and girl could be changed by a funny little war between two small countries far across the sea . The spies of the two little nations were at a Pacific seaport , each trying to prevent the other getting ships and supplies . And yet it came to pass .
" Gentlemen , the enemy have just purchased the steamship Navigator . "
" There she lies now , and it is our patriotic duty to destroy that ship . "
" We will send her adrift in the fog tonight before the new crew goes aboard . - - The wind - the tide - and the rocks will do the rest . "
The wealthy ship owner who has just sold the Navigator . ( Actor : Fredrick Vroom )
And his daughter .
( Actress :
Kathryn Maguire )
- Heir to the Treadway fortune - a living proof that every family tree must have its sap .
( Actor : Buster Keaton )
" I think I 'll get married . "
" Today . "
" We 'll sail for Honolulu tomorrow on our honey-moon - get two tickets . "
" He had completed all arrangements - - except to notify the girl . "
" Will you marry me ? "
" Certainly not ! "
" I think a long walk would do me good . "
" Your tickets , sir - - and congratulations . "
" The boat sails at ten in the morning , sir . "
" I don 't get up that early - so I 'll go aboard tonight . "
Going on a honeymoon without a bride is like singing the words of " Kiss Me Again " to the music of " Alice , Where Art Thou . "
" I must get some papers off the Navigator , so stop at Pier 12 . "
" Is there any one on board ? "
Under the cover of darkness the foreign agents prepared to carry out their plans .
The next morning found the Navigator drifting helplessly at sea .
" Will you marry me ? "
" This is a fine time to ask me that .
I 'm cold and hungry and - - "
" Put up that bright one . "
" She 's quarantined . "
" Try and catch them ! "
" Hey !
Wait a minute ! "
By the time they were ready to say " good-night " they had found a couple of sea-going tuxedos .
Asleep in the Deep - Wilfred Glenn
Danger is near thee -

Weeks later - still drifting .
We now find the crew with a safe and quiet place to sleep .
" Land ! "

" We 're safer on the boat . "
" We 're drifting toward them . "
" We 're safe ! I 've anchored the ship . "
" We are sinking !

" Can 't you fix it ? "
" That would have to be fixed from the outside . "

Kriemhild 's Revenge Canto I
How Kriemhild mourned over Siegfried and how King Attilla woos her through his ambassador , Ruediger von Bechlam .
King Gunther , Margrave Ruediger von Bechlam asks for an audience .
I come as ambassador of King Attilla , who is called lord of the Earth .
He seeks the hand of Kriemhild , your sister , in marriage .
I am afraid King Attilla does not know whom he woos .
In the name of Siegfried who was murdered and whose murder lives !
Bear in mind how Siegfried died !
King Attilla sends me , Lady Kriemhild , to plead in his stead for your hand !
Ruediger , you seem to know quite well how I am exposed to grievous wrongs in the house of my clan !
Brother !
Where is your brother Siegfried ?
My king , deliver to me the murderer of my husband !
He has kept faith with me , I shall keep faith with him .
This , Kriemhild , is my last word !
Margrave Ruediger , Lady Kriemhild wishes to speak with you after evensong !
Now is the time to keep close watch over our Burgundy , Gerenot !
Tell me all about King Attilla , Ruediger !
You are wooing a dead woman , Ruediger .
The murderer of my husband flaunts the green sparkling sword he robbed from the dead !
If somebody , my lady , would do you wrong at Attila 's court , King Attilla shall know how to avenge you !
Lord Margrave , swear that to me in King Attilla 's name and yours !
Not on the cross , Lord Margrave - on the sharp edge of your sword !
My lady !
Lord Hagen has robbed the Nibelungen treasure !
You have my word , Margrave Ruediger !
Hagen Tronje , where is the treasure ?
The loyal Hagen speaks :
At a place , my lady , where no one can use the gold to forge weapons against the kings of Burgundy !
Here ends the first Canto .
Canto II
How Kriemhild takes leave from her homeland , and how she was received by King Attilla .
Earth , you were once soaked with Siegfried 's blood .
One day I shall come and drench you with the blood of Hagen Tronje !
I shall return !
Rest assured , I 'll come back !
My daughter , don 't you want to bid farewell to your brother Gunther ?
No , mother .
You travel far , Lady Kriemhild .
Don 't you want to make peace with your family ?
No , my priest .
Don 't you want to greet them one last time , my Lady ?
No , Ruediger .
When Kriemhild reached the country of the Huns , spring had come to the land .
The sack of gold is mine !
The Queen is coming !
Let us meet her , brother !
The King 's treasure !
My lady , King Attilla 's brother , Blaodel , welcomes you !
Ruediger , choose a kingdom from my lands in gratitude for this wondrous woman !
Ask King Attilla , Margrave Ruediger , if he is ready to make your oath his own !
By my head , o queen - whoever dares to offend you , shall die a hundred deaths !
Here ends the second Canto .
Canto III
How King Attilla besieged Rome and how Kriemhild summoned her brothers .
Lord Attilla swore to turn Rome 's churches into horse stables !
Why does he not fulfill his oath ?
We went into war !
Why don 't we ride on ?
Why is Attilla 's horse tethered to his tent ?
And when King Attilla his mount bestrode It was the world over which he rode And when he paused his whip to crack the world cried out - Woe , woe , alack What deeds are now in his mind ?
What is in the mind of our King ?
He sleeps !
He sleeps !
Lord Attilla , Attilla sleeps !
The white woman stole and bound our lord !
She uses golden tresses as cord !
The white woman stole and bound our lord !
She uses golden tresses as cord !
My Lord - !
Kriemhild ...
My lord - !
Kriemhild has borne you a son !
Earth ... O sacred Earth !
A wish - have you no wish I can fulfill ?
If you would honor me and gladden my heart , then bid my brothers as guests to your court .
Leave for Worms , Blaodel , to invite the royal brothers of my wife as guests to our court !
Here ends the third Canto .
Canto IV
How Kriemhild receives her brothers .
For over a month your brothers stayed as guests of Ruediger von Bechlarn .
The minstrels sing a new song about the love between your brother Giselher , and Ruediger 's only child , the beautiful Dietlind !
Thus Bechlam and Burgundy are bound together : one heart , one life , one death !
To honor your brothers , lord Attilla has sent the noblest of his knights , Dietrich von Bern , to greet them .
Once more , dear Nibelungen , before Lord Attilla comes to greet you :
Do not forget to whom Attilla will lead you !
How could we forget , lord , that we come to visit our sister , Kriemhild ?
Whoever wants to win my gratitude , must remember my great sorrow !
On the day before summer solstice the Nibelungen arrived at Attilla 's court .
You must be tired from your journey .
Refresh yourselves and rest .
Tomorrow we will celebrate the summer solstice in a very special way .
King Attilla , remember your oath !
He who murdered Siegfried is now in your hands !
Remember my suffering !
Can you never forget Lord Siegfried , woman ?
Hagen Tronje shall duel with me for his life !
You would fight an assassin , Attilla ?
No , have him killed !
My guest ?
Remember you oath , Attilla !
On the life of your child , redeem it !
In the desert , where I was born , there is but one thing sacred , the guest !
Hagen Tronje shall be sacred as long as he respects the peace of my abode !
She said :
Whoever wants to win my gratitude , should remember my great sorrow !
Whoever brings me Tronje 's head will win a shield full of gold !
But I beseech you : Do not harm the sons of my mother !
Bard , play on !
Here ends the fourth Canto .
Canto V
How the Huns celebrated the summer solstice with the Nibelungen .
Is it the fashion at Worms to sit at table armed head to toe ?
Lord Hagen Tronje knows well , why he never lays aside his sword !
Methinks , from such a feast the heir to King Attilla 's crowns should not be absent !
Methinks the boy has not long to live .
We scarcely shall go as guests to any courts of his !
Treason !
The child !
The work of your guest , King Attilla !
Now you Nibelungen , all of my men will be against you .
Safe conduct from these halls I demand for me and my following !
Here ends the fifth Canto .
Canto VI
The Nibelungen 's distress .
Go , tell Lady Kriemhild what you have seen !
Open the gate !
Not a Hun is alive in Attilla 's hall !
Huns , avenge your dead !
It is impossible , my Queen !
Avenge your dead , Huns , and the royal child !
Sister !
Sister !
Think of our mother !
Hand over the assassin of Siegfried and you are free !
The fight is too uneven .
The dawn will see no Nibelung alive .
With Giselher my own child will die !
Lord Ruediger , stay out of it !
Blood cries for blood !
Call Ruediger !
Now the time has come , Lord Ruediger !
Redeem your oath !
Margrave Ruediger , I demand from you the assassin of Siegfried !
Not against Hagen Tronje , do you send me , Queen , but against your brothers who defend him with their lives !
Ruediger , you swore by the sharp edge of your sword !
Giselher is engaged to my only child !
Blood cries for blood , Ruediger !
Lord !
Do not force me to kill my only child !
Here ends the sixth Canto
Canto VII
The Nibelungen 's end .
Lord Ruediger stands before the gate !
He will bring peace !
What are you bringing us , father ?
Death !
O Lord , do not allow that they who love , kill one another
Tell them that if they deliver the murderer of my child , they may go free !
King Attilla , you do not know the loyal German soul !
My oath to Kriemhild is older than my oath to you !
Don 't force me to break my oath !
Fight !
Do you want me to lose my honor ? !
- Defend yourself , Hagen Tronje !
O sister , what have you wrought !
Deliver Tronje to me and you are free !
Rejoice in your revenge Kriemhild !
Dead are your young brothers .
Ruediger is dead .
Dead are all his men !
But Hagen Tronje , who slew Siegfried , still lives !
Throw fire into the hall !
O lord , fiery arrows are raining on the hall by the queen 's order - the palace is burning .
Lady Kriemhild is right , more than right !
I myself will stand at her side when the fire will flush out Hagen , the murderer !
Thank you , Kriemhild !
Although we were never one in love , we are at last united in hate !
Never , King Attilla , has my heart been as filled with love as it is at this moment .
I wish to spare King Gunther death in the flames .
I shall offer Lady Kriemhild my head !
Speak , you Nibelungen .
Will you buy your freedom with Hagen Tronje 's head ?
Loyalty , which iron could not break , will not melt in fire , Hagen Tronje !
Look !
Volker prepares his violin for a last song !
I call it a shame , Lady Kriemhild that you let heroes , who could not be beaten in battle , perish in fire 's fury !
Do you hear ?
Volker is singing !
Ah , if only we were on the green , fresh banks of the Rhine !
Do you hear ?
Volker is singing !
Are you not human , Lady Kriemhild !
No , I died when Siegfried died ...
It is finished !
It is finished !
Lord Attilla , there still lives one vassal !
I cannot go home to my dead Siegfried until every wrong has been atoned ...
Lord Hagen , here is the sword .
Where is the treasure ?
I swore not to betray the location of the treasure as long as one of my kings is alive !
Now , Kriemhild , nobody knows about the treasure but God and me and God is no more discreet than I !
Now , earth , drink your fill !
Take Kriemhild home to Siegfried , her dead husband , for she was his and never belonged to another man !
Thus ends the tale of Kriemhild 's Revenge .

Siegfried Canto I
How Siegfried slayed the dragon
Thus spoke Mime , the artful blacksmith : " Siegfried , son of King Siegmund , ride home to Xanten .
Even I cannot teach you any more ! "
Have you never before heard of the king 's castle at Worms on the Rhine and the kings of Burgundy who reign there ?
I shall go there to win Kriemhild !
Show me the way to Worms or you will lose your life !
Farewell , Siegfried , son of king Siegmund .
You will never get to Worms !
Young Siegfried understood the bird 's song :
If the dragon slayer would bathe in the dragon 's blood , his body would become invincible , forever safe against sword and spear !
Here ends the first Canto
Canto II
Now Volker , the bard , sang of Siegfried in front of Kriemhild , and how Siegfried came to Worms .
The violin sounded and Volker sang :
The dragon slayer , the son of Siegmund entered the realm of the Nibelungen .
He won the fight against the dragon .
There is no one on earth like him .
Thus spoke Alberich , the Nibelung :
Spare my life and I will give you the wonder cap .
Whoever wears it becomes unseen or may take whatever form he chooses !
Spare my life , O hero , and I will make you the richest king on earth !
The crown of the King of the Northland , the ruler of the Ice giants is being wrought here by the Nibelungen .
No sword on earth compares with Balmung .
The Nibelungen forged it in fire of blood .
All is lost .
Cursed be the heritage of the heir !
Return with me to stone all ye whom from stone were wrought .
The violin sounded and Volker sang :
Siegfried became the dragon slayer The lord of the Nibelungen Treasure .
Twelve kingdoms subdued the powerful .
Twelve kings became his vassals .
Kriemhild , the daughter of Ute : " Volker , take this cloak , as reward for your song !
I embroidered it myself .
Siegfried , son of King Sigmund , is outside the castle door with twelve of his knights , and asks for an audience with King Gunther .
Thus spake Hagen Tronje :
King Gunther , let the dragon slayer go his ways , don 't welcome him here !
No one shall say that at Worms one does not know the way kings greet each other !
Siegfried , son of King Siegmund , has my welcome !
I dreamt last night an awful dream ... And now this dream comes to my mind !
I come , King Gunther , to ask for your sister Kriemhild 's hand .
King Gunther , too , has marriage plans .
He has set his heart on a bold and mighty maiden .
Her name is Brunhild and she is Queen of Iceland .
Ringed by fire , her invincible castle towers in the Northland .
Why must you speak of Brunhild ?
You know she has set dangerous conditions :
Thrice must the suitor best her in feats of strength or die !
Siegfried , the unique hero , has come to Worms at an opportune moment .
He may help us win Brunhild for you !
Twelve kings have I for vassals . But vassal am I to no man , now and ever !
Prepare for the quest to get your bride , King Gunther .
It is Siegfried the mighty hero who will win Brunhild for you .
Here ends the second Canto .
Canto III :
How Siegfried won Brunhild for Gunther
The dragon ship is carrying foreign heroes to your shores !
The foreigners are nearing the flaming sea .
If he be strong enough and favored by the gods , the flames will consume themselves and die .
My maidens , help me put on my armor , this will be a a fight I 've never fought before !
Welcome , hero , for the fight for life or death !
Neither life nor death do I desire from you , Brunhild .
It is King Gunther who woos you !
Before it is evening , King Gunther , your smothered weapons will adorn my hall .
Give me leave , King Gunther , to make ready your ship for your royal bride .
We should set sail for home before sundown !
Let the triple battle begin , King Gunther !
You have to defeat me three times , o king : with the stone , the spring , and the spear .
Fear not , o king !
Make you the motions and my strength will win each contest .
I 'll throw the stone for you and carry you in the jump .
Here ends the third Canto
Canto IV
How Brunhild enters Worms and how the kings celebrated their wedding .
Start the prepartions for marriage !
The king 's ship is arriving !
We have reached our destination , my queen !
Are you really the man who defeated me threefold ?
I am your captive , but I shall never be your wife !
Keep your word , King Gunther , as I have kept mine !
If Kriemhild gives her consent , o hero , we shall celebrate a double wedding here today .
Since when is it customary among Burgundians to give the King 's daughter in marriage to a vassal ?
Siegfried is no vassal .
I love him as though he were my brother .
We shall become blood brothers today !
Blood is mingling with red blood , the drops fuse inseparably .
Whoever forsakes loyalty to the bloodbrother will perish at the wayside , all honor is lost !
Brunhild has been defeated , not cowed .
Shall the king of Burgundy be scorned by an obstinate woman ?
Damned be the deed half done !
Will you forsake your friend who gave you his own sister ?
The magic cap will change you into what you wish .
Take Gunther 's form and break Brunhild 's iron will .
Here ends the fourth Canto
Canto V
How , after half a year , Siegfried 's gift to his bride , the Nibelungen Treasure , arrives in Worms and how the two queens quarrel with each other .
O king , Burgundy 's glory is waning , we need the Nibelungen treasure .
It would be folly to reject what Siegfried offers you as a brother and Kriemhild is worth more than all the gold in the world !
See what I found !
Put away the armlet , Kriemhild , it guards an ugly secret .
The Mistress of the Nibelungen Treasure has no need for it !
Listen , Kriemhild , at how I won the armlet - and keep silent !
The Nibelungen treasure has arrived !
How long , King Gunther , will Siegfried and Kriemhild tarry at the court of Burgundy ?
They stay for the sake of my mother .
Would you , Brunhild , be willing to take up the daughter 's place for Queen Ute ?
Your brother 's honor is entwined with this armlet .
It never should be seen again by human eyes !
It seems to me high time , King Gunther , that you send Siegfried back home to Xanten !
Never !
He shall leave of his own freewill !
I am going to attend mass , my daughter .
Follow me soon !
I 'll go to the cathedral in the regalia of the queen of Burgundy !
The wife of a vassal may not precede the Queen of Burgundy !
How did you dare refer to Siegfried , my husband ?
Siegfried introduced himself to me as Gunther 's vassal and servant .
He did servant 's work for my husband !
You , whom he disdained .
You , whom he gave away .
You dare to belittle Siegfried ?
Make way for the Queen of Burgundy , vassal woman !
You recognize this armlet , you queen of Burgundy ?
How came that armlet into your hand ?
The carrier of the magic helmet who , disguised as Gunther , defeated you three times
- Siegfried , my husband gave it to me !
King !
Speaks your sister the truth ?
Kill Siegfried !
Kill Siegfried !
Your babbling , hero , was worse than murder !
Kill Siegfried !
Siegfried is safe from your wrath .
None can slay the dragon slayer !
Save in one spot , where the linden leaf clung , is he vulnerable as other men !
King Gunther , let me deal with the dragon slayer !
We pledged blood brotherhood .
How can I be party to his death ?
The one who took the armlet from me made me his wife , took my maidenhood from me !
Tronje , announce to the people of Burgundy that I invite everybody to a royal hunt to kill a mad dog and a ravening .
Here ends the fifth Canto .
Canto VI
How Gunther betrayed Siegfried .
Can you keep a secret Kriemhild ?
I once broke the oath to be silent and never will do so again !
Well then , the upcoming hunt might easily turn into a chase for men .
A secret message warns me of war against Burgundy !
Good for you , Kriemhild , that your husband is the dragon slayer , the invincible !
Who warrants me that in the heat of battle not a chance blade should pierce where the lime leaf fell ?
If you want me to protect him , I have to know the exact spot where the invicible could be hurt !
You are good counsel , you truest of true .
I shall mark the spot with a little cross myself !
I come to take leave , Brunhild .
We are starting for the hunt in the Odenwald forest .
Mind my vow , King Gunther , I shall not eat nor drink until my disgrace has been vindicated !
O my dear lord , don 't leave me .
I dreamt last night a furious boar tore you to pieces !
O my dear lord , don 't leave me .
I dreamt further that two mountains collapsed and buried you !
Today Gunther and I will reconcile .
Who else is my enemy ?
Mother , I feel as if blood is draining from my heart !
The hunt in the Odenwald forest lasted from morning until sundown .
A handful of red gold for a cooling draught of white wine !
A wheel broke from the wagon loaded with wine .
But I know of a cool brook nearby !
I always heard of you as the fastest runner of all heroes , let 's run , you and I , for the first draught !
Gunther , my brother , let 's be friends again !
When you are back from the spring !
Grim Hagen spoke :
The hunt is over ! "
Here ends the sixth Canto .
Canto VII
How Kriemhild swears revenge to Hagen Tronje .
You may break your fast , Brumhild , Siegfried is dead .
Hail to you King Gunther !
For the sake of a woman 's lie , you have slain your most loyal friend !
I call to you for justice , King Gunther !
Hagen Tronje has slain my husband !
Loyalty for loyalty , Kriemhild .
His deed is ours .
His fate is ours .
Our breast is his shield .
You might try to hide among my clan , behind the altars of God , or at the end of the world
- You cannot escape my vengeance , Hagen Tronje !
Announce to King Gunther , my brother , the Queen of Burgundy is dead !
Thus ends the tale of Siegfried .
The Hands of Orlac
Beloved , In one day and one night I will again be with you .
I will hold you in my arms ... my hands will run over your hair
I will feel your body tremble under my hands
Orlac 's concert
Madam , it is 9 o 'clock and the train arrives at 11
To Montgeron
He is alive !
It is 6 : 30 , Professor .
Vasseur will be executed at 6 o 'clock , and 8 minutes later the car will bring the body to the clinic .
A train accident .
There is damage at the base of the skull , where we will operate ... only ... only his hands Mr. Orlac is severely injured .
And yet there is hope . The hands ... holy God ... the hands ...
Save his hands ... his hands are his life ... .
Save his hands ... his hands are more important than his life .
Save his hands ...
I will try .
After only a short time , you can come home ... and sun , light and many flowers will greet you , when you come .
We will remove your bandages - a little at a time .
Today you will see your face again .
Your eyes - how I love you ... your hair ... and your hands ... your beautiful , dear hands ...
There ... his head ... doesn 't he see my hands ?
" Is he laughing ? "
Now ... he is so strong !
Tell me , what are under these bandages ?
What secret do they hide ?
Well , then , in God 's name , we will reveal the secret .
Can these hands ever play again ?
The spirit rules the hands ... nature and a strong will can do anything .
Tomorrow ... back tomorrow !
I will wait here ... his first kiss and the first stroke of his hands .
The last night .
Your hands were not saved ...
Dr. Serral gave you different ones .
The hands of the executed murderer Vasseur .
Is it true ?
Do I have the hands of the murderer Vasseur ?
How much longer ?
In half an hour .
No , only 30 minutes .
These hands will never strike a man again .
How much longer
I love you ...
I love you ...
Do you have the paper for January 15 ?
The murderer Vasseur before his judges .
Vasseur denied the act ... but the fingerprints which were found gave the real evidence .
The dagger , which was stuck into the heart of the old racketeer , bore the same X mark on the handle .
Also , the dagger bore Vasseur 's unmistakable fingerprints .
The evidence was so clear that he received the death penalty .
I feel it also go out ... the arms spread ... until then in the soul ... cold , terrible , grim .
Twisted - twisted hands !
I don 't want to save you ? I will not come ... not my ... no more ...
I cannot any more ... you are coming to kill ... .
but I will not follow your terrible orders any more ... no more
Don 't come any closer to me !
Go away ... I will not listen to you any longer .
... Debauch your hands ...
Don 't mix ... away with your hands ... such murderer 's hands ...
Take away your hands .
I don 't want these terrible hands .
Creditors
Only wait a short time ... one month ...
I know it ... You demand blood ... Crimes ...
Only one week !
Men don 't just control the hands ... The head , the heart control the body ... , also the hands ...
Until tomorrow !
My hat and my coat ... I am going to my husband 's father .
He is rich ... he can help ... if he will ...
I can 't leave anyone to him ...
At the least everyone from ... there
Mr. Orlac - you know , what bad luck has happened to him
Mr. Orlac
- Paul cannot play now . So we are in need .
But Paul doesn 't know ... help us .
He is your son ... your flesh and blood ... will you let us be ground in to the earth ...
Yes , I would like to see it !
I hate him ...
Mr. Orlac must himself go to see his father ... today !
How will madam pay ...
Beloved , yet one day and one night , and then I will be with you again .
That was ... once ... my handwriting
After one day and one night ,
He refused to help ... and I have begged him so ... he is not a good man , your father ... he is evil .
Murder !
The murderer Vasseur 's dagger !
The fingerprints of the criminal Vasseur !
Your sister is very ill ... come right away , if you want to see her while she is still alive ... come today ...
Vasseur 's handwriting !
I do not know what secret he is going to give us . Vasseur has been dead for years , but his hands still live .
Paul Orlac , you are your father 's heir .
You will bring me a million tomorrow .
At this time !
Money ?
Money ?
And therefore you follow me awake and in my dreams ?
Why ?
For my hands !
Who are you ?
I am Vasseur , who was executed on July 13th .
The experiment that Professor Serral performed with your hands his assistant made off with my head .
If I don 't get the million tomorrow at this time I will go to the State Prosecutor and tell him who your father 's murderer is .
Who is the murderer ?
You are ...
Paul Orlac !
These fingerprints , which are clearly visible are the fingerprints of Vasseur . And who has those fingers now - you , Paul Orlac !
The letter , which passed through all the servants in the house , was written by the hand of Vasseur , and this hand is now - your hand !
The dagger , with which the murder was done is Vasseur 's dagger with the X.
Your maid will swear , that she saw you with it - in your hand ..
Perhaps you did not do the murder - but you cannot deny ... .
What is happening to me ?
Am I crazy ?
Won 't you tell me what is bothering you ?
I have the feeling , that these hands are drawing me ... to crime ... .
I must bring him the money .
You will tell the State Prosecutor everything ...
Who will believe me ?
They will believe you - as I believe you .
I go in a free man .
Wait , perhaps , and we will have news for the evening paper .
It is odd , but I don 't know , whether I am experiencing reality or a dream . It is odd , but I don 't know , whether I am experiencing reality or a dream .
A stranger .
He was then executed ... I have seen with my own eyes the work of the guillotine on a neck .
He was then executed ... I have seen with my own eyes the work of the guillotine on a neck .
Mr. Orlac , we thank you for your evidence ...
Go this evening , bring the money with you to the stranger ,
And we will follow you .
Someone well known to us
- Mr. Nera , at last . Assistant to Professor Serral , One of the least talented crooks in the world .
I am also a blackmailer .
But , you are searching for the murderer ?
Haven 't you considered , that the murderer has Vasseur 's hands ... I don 't have those hands . Haven 't you considered , that the murderer has Vasseur 's hands ...
I don 't have those hands .
I can tell you who has those hands .
Mr. Orlac , I arrest you !
Mr. Orlac is not guilty
- Nera is the murderer .
Keep silent !
Explain the fingerprints of the executed Vasseur !
Nera was Vasseur 's friend ... He secretly made imprints of Vasseur 's fingerprints And then he had rubber gloves made ... with Vasseur 's fingerprints .
And so he killed the elder Orlac ...
If Vasseur was not guilty ... then my hands are pure ...
There is an old proverb which says :
Don 't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both .

Administrators A. P. KRYUKOV and A. KOTOSHEV Part one . " MEN AND MAGGOTS . "
The spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land .
A tremendous , mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts .
The individual personality , having hardly had time to become conscious of itself ... dissolved in the mass , and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary élan .
Sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk .
We , the sailors of Potemkin , must support the workers , our brothers ... and stand among the front lines of the revolution !
Heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty .
Attentive , but clumsy .
He vents his anger on a young man .
Hurtful ...
Vakulinchuk
Comrades !
The time has come when we too must speak out .
Why wait ?
All of Russia has risen !
Are we to be the last ?
Morning .
We 've had enough rotten meat !
Even a dog wouldn 't eat this !
The ship doctor Smirnov .
It could crawl overboard on its own !
These aren 't worms .
They are dead fly larvae .
You can wash them off with brine !
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are !
We 've had enough rotten meat !
It 's good meat .
End of discussion !
Senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing .
The ship 's store .
The sailors refused to eat the borscht .
GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
Part two .
" DRAMA ON THE DECK . "
Commander Golikov
Whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward !
The petty officers .
You 're free to go !
I 'll hang the rest on the yard !
Call the guards !
Matyushenko , under the guise of breaking ranks , calls the sailors to the gun turret .
To the turret ...
To the turret ! To the turret ...
Guys ! ...
It 's time .
Most of them gathered by the turret .
Stop !
Don 't move !
They try to sneak through the admiral 's hatch .
Back , scoundrels !
That way is not for you !
I 'll shoot you all like dogs !
Cover them with canvas !
Got it !
Cover them !
Attention !
Dear Lord ! Make the disobedient see reason !
Fire right into the canvas !
Vakulinchuk decides .
Fire !
BROTHERS !
Who are you shooting at ? !
The rifles quavered .
Shoot !
Everyone shoot !
Shoot , scum !
To the rifles , brothers !
Smash the dragons ! Smash ' em !
Smash ' em all !
Have fear of God !
Beat it , sorcerer !
To the bottom to feed the worms !
Brothers ! We 've won !
The bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky .
Vakulinchuk 's overboard !
Save Vakulinchuk !
And he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner 's hand .
To the shore .
Odessa .
A tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk .
FOR A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
Part three .
" THE DEAD MAN CALLS OUT . "
Mist lingered on from the night ...
Rumours came from the pier .
Together with the sun , the news hit the city .
The battleship raided rebellion shore ...
A killed sailor ...
We 'll remember .
For a spoonful of borscht .
" Citizens of Odessa !
Lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk ... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky . Let 's take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires !
Death to the oppressors ! Signed :
Crew of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky . "
Eternal memory to the fallen fighters !
All for one .
One for all .
Down with the executioners !
Down with tyranny !
Mothers and brothers !
Let there not be differences or hostility among us !
Smash the Jews !
Shoulder to shoulder .
The land is ours .
Tomorrow is ours .
A delegate from shore .
The enemy must be dealt a decisive blow !
Together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia
WE WILL WIN !
The shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively .
Part four .
" THE ODESSA STAIRCASE . "
In those memorable days , the city lived together with the rebellious battleship .
Like a white-winged flock , boats flew to the battleship .
AND SUDDENLY
Let 's go ! Let 's convince them !
Listen !
Don 't shoot !
My boy is badly hurt .
COSSACKS !
And then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship 's shells .
The target - the Odessa theater .
The generals ' headquarters .
Part five .
" RENDEZVOUS WITH THE SQUADRON . "
Turbulent meetings went on until evening .
The people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators !
Land the troops and the army will join you .
Landing is not possible .
The admiral 's squadron is coming our way .
With one heart , they decided to face the squadron .
Night came , full of anxiety .
The squadron was sneaking up in the darkness .
Sore from constant speech , throats breathe heavily and unevenly .
Squadron on the horizon !
All hands on deck !
Prepare for battle !
Full speed !
Hearts forward !
Top speed !
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267 .
The admiral attacks !
The squadron draws near !
Give the signal : join us !
Join ! ... ... us !
The enemy is within firing range !
All against one .
ONE AGAINST ALL .
... or ...
BROTHERS !
Above the heads of the tsar 's admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah .
And proudly waving the red flag of victory , without a single shot , the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron .

THE END Subtitle by Reza Fa
In the great Gold Rush , Alaska was the hope and dream of men , the ruthless siren of the Far North , beckoning thousands to her icy bosom . Beckoning thousands to her unknown regions .
Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier to the gold fields .
Over this Pass men faced untold misery and hardship .
Many lost their lives . Some fell by the wayside , others lost courage and turned back . But the brave went on .
Far into the icy north , deep into the silent nowhere , came an undaunted lone prospector .
And somewhere in that nowhere was another lone prospector .
With cheerful optimism our little Columbus descended , then stopped , stepped , slipped and slid .
" Now let me see , " thought the little fellow .
" Before I know where I am , I must get there . "
There in that frozen wilderness a dream came true , and a lone voice shrieked into the solemn sky ,
" Eureka !
I 've found it , a mountain of gold ! "
But the elements laughed , roared and thundered .
In that raging nowhere was a lone cabin , and another lone man , Black Larson , an unmitigated , predatory scoundrel .
Out of the lashing storm came the Little Fellow to find shelter and perhaps a little hospitality .
There he sat , resting his weary bones as the icy wind howled through the knothole .
" Come here , " said Larson .
" What are you doing ? "
" Eating , obviously . "
" Get out . "
" Go on ! "
" Get out ! "
The wind also was giving Big Jim his troubles .
Big Jim was the noble type . He had suffered .
Oh , how he loved to suffer . He suffered about everything .
" Get out , " said Black Larson .
" Or I 'll fill you both full of lead . "
" Now then , the pair of you , get out ! "
" Out ! "
That kind of noise Jim don 't tolerate .
" I 'll stay right here , understand ? "
" Right here , " said Big Jim .
" Yes , sir , he 'll stay right here , " said the Little Fellow .
" Understand ?
We stay right here . "
And stay they did , for days and nights .
The cabin moaned and groaned .
Two men walked and never talked , hunger gnawed their bones .
" I must have food ! " yelled Big Jim .
" I must have food ! "
" What are you eating ? " Said Black Larson .
" Nothing . "
" Open your mouth ! "
" Liar ! It 's that candle . "
" That ? " said the Little Fellow . " How revolting . "
" If I thought you were holding out on me , I 'd slit your gizzard ! "
" One of us must brave that storm , if we 're to get food . "
" Come here , the pair of you . "
" We 'll cut the cards and the low man goes . "
" You 're the man , " said Jim .
" Goodbye , good luck . "
" Don 't forget to bring home the bacon . "
Somewhere in that nowhere , the law was looking for Black Larson .
Desperate with hunger and here it was Thanksgiving Day .
Nevertheless there was something to be thankful for .
" Not quite done yet , give it two more minutes . "
" Come on , come on , " said Big Jim .
After scouring the country for food , the Little Fellow had to admit he had seen nothing , not even a field mouse .
From the pangs of hunger ,
Big Jim was becoming delirious , hysterical .
In fact he was a pain in the neck .
" Food , food ! " he thundered .
" I can put another shoe in the pot . "
" No , no , anything but that ! "
Poor Jim , he couldn 't take it .
" What 's the matter ? " Said the Little Fellow .
" I thought you were a chicken . "
" Well , build up the fire , " said Big Jim .
" What 's the matter with you ? " Said the Little Fellow .
" Come , my pretty bird , " said Big Jim .
" Don 't be childish . "
" Hey , quit it .
Don 't be foolish , it 's me ! "
" You ! " said Jim .
" I 'm sorry .
I must be crazy . "
" You 're telling me , " said the Little Fellow .
" You go inside . I 'll take the gun in case you lose it . "
Chicken or no chicken , the Little Fellow looks appetizing to Big Jim .
Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled onto Big Jim 's mountain of gold .
Then came the parting of the ways ,
Big Jim to his mine , our hero to his fate .
" Goodbye , " said the Little Fellow .
" It 's been a great pleasure knowing you . "
Treachery awaited Big Jim at his mountain of gold .
Big Jim looked deep into the eyes of Black Larson and saw there the soul of a skunk .
Caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds , Black Larson swept on to impending doom .
And out of a dream in that frozen waste , a city grew . And humanity warmed it with living , loving and desiring .
Georgia .
Jack was a ladies ' man .
Georgia was quick and impulsive , proud and independent .
In the evening Georgia worked as a dancehall girl .
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia . Perhaps that 's why she resented him .
Out of the night came the Little Fellow , towards the dancehall , that beacon light of pleasure , that retreat of lost dreams .
" Georgia , why aren 't you nice to Jack ? "
" I believe he really likes you , " said the girl .
" He likes everybody , " said Georgia quite audibly .
" I 'm bored with this place , " she continued .
" I 'd give it all up if I could find someone honest and worthwhile . "
" Don 't worry , I 'll find him someday . "
Then she turned and looked and looked and looked .
" Kinda fresh , ain 't ya ? " Thought Jack .
" Get down off that high horse . "
" Me and you are gonna dance . "
" Hey there , pan out a tune . "
" Just a moment , I said we 're gonna dance . "
" I beg your pardon , " said Georgia .
To show her utter contempt for Jack , she picked out the most deplorable looking tramp in the dancehall .
" Hey you , come here . "
" Yes , you .
Do you want to dance ? "
" You see , I 'm very particular about whom I dance with . "
And there he stood , the dauntless cavalier , guarding ... her sanctuary .
" If you wanna make a hit with your lady friend , "
" you should put your hat on straight , like this ! "
" Take that you ... Ouch ! "
" Huh ! Very good . "
" Didn 't know me own strength , " said the Little Fellow .
Hank Curtis ' cabin was a stone 's throw from the dancehall .
Hank was a mining engineer who lived alone and occasionally went on long expeditions into the Far North .
Hank was kind and human , and our hero cold and hungry , and the beans smelled good and the coffee was steaming hot .
So the Little Fellow devised a way of getting breakfast .
Big Jim recovered from the blow he received from Black Larson but lost his memory .
Hank 's partner arrives .
Both are ready to leave on a long expedition .
Hank informs his partner that the Little Fellow is to look after the cabin while he 's away .
" Goodbye , " said Hank . " And don 't forget to feed the mule . "
Since that night in the dancehall the Little Fellow hadn 't seen Georgia , but an incident was to bring them together again .
There she stood , her loveliness lighting the room , filling his soul with the music of romance for which he was so ill-fitted .
As she introduced her friends , his heart began to sing .
As they warmed up by the stove , he excused himself to get firewood .
And in that cabin his secret was revealed , his love for Georgia .
And the girls giggled and laughed , perhaps in order to hide their pity . For in the world of the dancehall it wasn 't wise for the girls to reveal their hearts .
And so they thought they 'd have a little fun with him .
There in the gloaming they sat , their faces alight with mischief , but all the while his heart was singing .
And so she fooled and flirted and stroked his hair .
He knew she was fooling , but he was happy . For she was near him , holding his hand , smiling at him .
" Nice place you have here , " said Georgia .
" I hope you will invite us again . "
What if she were fooling ?
He was enjoying the warmth of her attention . And the lady was enjoying the warmth of his chair .
And now she was leaving .
The light of her loveliness would be gone .
And he would be left with an emptiness , to return to his bleak , lonely existence .
" Pardon me , " said the Little Fellow ,
" But , uh ... " He was lost for words .
" Would you really like to come again ? "
" Of course , " said Georgia .
" What do you say , girls ? "
" We 'll come for dinner New Year 's Eve , " said the ladies .
" Very well , " said Georgia .
" We 'll come to dinner New Year 's Eve . "
Of course at that moment Georgia would forget her gloves !
For the next few days the Little Fellow hustled and shoveled in order to buy that New Year 's dinner .
The eve of a new year . New hopes and new dreams .
And there was Georgia , caressing him with her smiles and tender glances .
And the girls called for a speech .
But he was too happy to speak .
All that mattered was Georgia was there . Georgia !
So he muttered and stuttered and finally said ,
" I can 't make a speech but I 'll do a dance . "
And a dance he did , with the rolls .
Should auld acquaintance be forgot And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot And days of auld lang syne For auld lang syne My dear
In the midst of all their revelry the vague memory of a promise crept into Georgia 's mind .
" Let 's go up and visit the Little Fellow , " she said .
" We 'll have some fun with him , " said Jack .
" We 'll send Georgia in first , then give him a scare . "
" Oh , forget it , " said Jack .
" How about giving me a little attention ? "
A day or so later in the Recorder 's office ,
Big Jim tried to convince the assayers that he had a mountain of gold .
" Where is this place ? " they said .
But Big Jim 's memory had failed him .
All he knew was that it was near the cabin .
" The cabin , that 's it ! "
" F I could find my way to the cabin I could find the mine . "
" But I can 't remember . "
" Hey ! " said Jack , " Georgia 's been looking for you . "
The Little Fellow knew otherwise .
How dare that cad mention her name so lightly ?
For two pins he 'd give him another thrashing . However being a little underweight he would ignore the insult .
But it was true . Georgia had been looking for him .
Georgia had written him a letter .
And as he went looking for Georgia , so Big Jim went looking for him .
" You , you ! " said Big Jim .
" You ! The very man I 've been looking for ! "
" The cabin , the cabin !
Where is it ? "
" Answer me , I say ! "
" Can 't you speak , man ?
Tell me ! "
" Where 's the cabin ? Where is it ? "
" At last I shall find my mountain of gold . "
" To your feet man , quick ! "
" You 're coming with me ! "
" Take me to the cabin and I 'll make you a millionaire ! "
" Georgia ! Just a moment , " said the Little Fellow .
" Georgia , you don 't have to explain . I understand . "
" I love you .
I 'll take you away from this life . "
" I 'm going away , and when I return , "
" I shall come back . "
Exhausted and footweary , they arrived at the cabin .
" Ah ! " said Big Jim , " it won 't be long now . "
" Bring in the eats and tomorrow we 'll start for the mine .
" Here , take a swig of this .
It 'll put hair on your topcoat . "
" My , this is a heavy lamb chop , " said the Little fellow .
Then fate - it 's always fate - played its little joke , and again the elements laughed , roared and thundered , but through it all our heroes soundly slumbered .
Then came the dawn .
The Little Fellow awoke , blissfully ignorant of what happened the night before , but feeling definitely conscious of " the morning after " .
" Oh well , may as well tidy up and get breakfast . "
" This is the worst liver attack I 've ever had . "
" Feel that rocking ? "
" It 's the stomach . "
" It 's not the stomach . "
" Let 's go to the other side . "
" We 'll see how far it will go over . "
" Something must be missing underneath . "
" I 'll go outside and see what it is . "
" Now , " said Big Jim , " don 't get excited . "
" Take it easy , don 't move , don 't breathe ! "
" I said don 't breathe , stupid . "
" You can be most annoying at times . "
" If you 'll only be cool , be calm , " said Big Jim ,
" We have nothing to worry about . "
" Now show a little character ! Where 's your willpower ? "
" Now listen , I 've got a very good idea . "
" Hold your hands like this , then I can get out first . "
" You see what I mean ? " Said Big Jim .
" Your mind is chaotic . You have no psychology . "
" You have no control . "
And Big Jim discovered his claim !
" Now we shall be rich , " said Jim .
" We shall be millionaires ! "
And so they were .
Now they were homeward bound and they were leaving the hardship and toil of Alaska to live in the land of milk and honey . To live , laugh and indulge themselves in the lap of luxury .
They were famous , and sought after by the press .
In their cabin deluxe they were welcomed and waited upon .
The reporter wanted to write the Little Fellow 's life story , " From Rags to Riches " , and he graciously consented .
And Big Jim was manicured .
" Not the nails , " said he , " the corns . "
The reporter thought of a good idea , to have the Little Fellow pose in his mining clothes .
It would make a human story .
Georgia ...
There she was in the steerage . Neither knew of the other 's presence .
Georgia overheard the officer say there was a stowaway aboard .
" You ! " said Georgia .
" I thought I 'd never see you again . "
And then she mistook him for the stowaway .
The officer was going to put him in irons . But Georgia pleaded for him and said she would pay his fare .
" Heck ! " said the Captain . " That 's no stowaway . "
" That 's Big Jim 's partner , the multimillionaire . "
Then of course there were apologies .
The Little Fellow gathered himself together . James , the valet , was told to prepare for an extra guest .
" Pardon me , " said the reporter , " but who 's the lady ? "
" Buzz buzz buzz ! "
" Oh , you don 't say !
Well , congratulations . "
" This will make a great story , and with a happy ending . "
And so it was . A happy ending .
From the Celebrated Novel by Gaston Leroux
Sanctuary of song lovers ,
Melody floats through hall and corridor , even to the executive offices , where a strange deal is being closed .
Now the Notary 's seal , gentlemen , and you are the fortunate new owners .
It is barely possible you may hear of a ghost , a Phantom of the Opera !
The attendant of Box Five will not laugh when you ask about the opera ghost !
You jest , Messieurs !
We are not children !
Who occupies Box Five ?
I do not know .
I have seen only the cloaked figure of a man who hides his face and will not speak !
Is it the Phantom ?
The Phantom !
The Phantom is up from the cellars again !
We saw him for an instant ... a gray shadow ... and he was gone !
He had no nose !
Yes , he did , it was enormous !
That man came out of the cellars ... just after we saw the Phantom .
Could it be that he ... ?
Joseph Buquet has really seen the Phantom !
Let 's ask him ...
His eyes are ghastly beads in which there is no light ... like holes in a grinning skull !
His face is like leprous parchment , yellow skin strung tight over protruding bones !
His nose ... there is no nose !
Have a care , Buquet ... ghosts like not to be seen or talked about !
Come , I 'll show you where I saw him ... in the scene-dock of the third cellar .
I saw him there !
A flash of shadow , and he was gone !
My daughter , Carlotta has been insulted !
Mlle Carlotte ,
Christine Daaé will sing the role of " Marguerite " , Wednesday night !
Any jealous attempt on your part to interefere with the performance will prove disastrous to your career .
The Phantom
" No ghost will frighten Carlotta !
Wednesday night found Mlle.
" What is this I hear about Christine favoring some mysterious admirer .
" Don 't worry , my dear Brother - nothing shall interfere with our love .
" I hear alot of rumors , Raoul-be careful ! "
" At last you have realized your ambition , my darling , and now we shall be married . "
" I can never leave the Opera , Raoul .
From hidden places beyond the walls a melodious voice , like the voice of an angel , spoke to her .
" Christine tonight I placed the world at your feet ! "
" To you I have imparted the full measure of my art .
You will triumph - all Paris will worship you ! "
But I warn you , you must forget all worldly things and think only of your career - and your Master ! "
" Soon , Christine , this spirit will take form and command your love ! "
" Call for me when you will .
I shall be waiting . "
In Mlle. Carolotta 's correspondence there appeared another letter , edged in black !
Mlle Carlotta If you appear tomorrow night you must be prepared for a great misfortune , and therefore I advise you to be " ill " The Phantom
" Christine Daae 's friends are plotting again !
But my daughter shall sing tomorrow night , come what may ! "
My dear Managers - The role of " Marguerite " shall be sung again tomorrow evening by Christine Daae , instead of Carlotta The Phantom
Encouraged by her mother , Carlotta defied every warning , and the following evening appeared as - " Marguerite ' .
" So far so good - for a house with a curse on it ! "
I cannot explain , but you must never intend to see me again .
" Beware !
She is singing to bring down the chandelier ! "
" Christine I have come for you - '
Walk to your mirror , my dear - - have no fear ! "
" Christine , it is I - your Master ! "
" Look not upon my mask - think rather of my devotion which has brought you the gift of song . "
A black lake , hidden from man and the sun , leading to the Phantom 's rendezvous .
" I have brought you here - - five cellars underground - " " - because I love you ! "
" For long weary months I have awaited this hour ! "
" So that which is good within me , aroused by your purity , might plead for your love . "
" That is where I sleep . "
" It keeps me reminded of that other dreamless sleep that cures all ills - forever ! "
" You
- Your are the Phantom ! "
" If I am the Phantom , it is because man 's hatred has made me so . "
" If I shall be saved , it will be because your love redeems me . "
" Men once knew me as Erik , but for many years I have lived in these cellars , a nameless legend . "
Another Phantom Tragedy
Christine Daae Disappears
The night passed - a night of vague horrors - - tortured dreams- -
Christine
My dear Christine You are in no peril as long as you do not touch my mask .
You will be free as long as your love for the spirit of Erik overcomes your fear .
" Since first I saw your face , this music has been singing to me of you and of - love triumphant ! "
" Yet listen - - there sounds an ominous undercurrent of warning ! "
" Feast , your eyes - glut your soul , on my accursed ugliness ! "
" Oh , mad Christine , who would not heed my warning ! "
" If you love me , as you say , let me go .
I promise to your slave forever ! "
I shall prove tlo you the debth of my love .
You may return to your world for the present .

Although I gave my word never to see you again I must .
I will be at the Bal Masque tomorrow night , but not alone beware !
One night each year , all Paris mingled , forgetful of caste- - the merry. mad Bal Masque de l 'Opera .
Into the midst of revelry , strode a spectral figure , robed in red .
" Beneath your dancing feet are the tombs of tortured men - this does the Red Death rebuke your merriment ! "
High above Paris on the roof of the Opera !
Are we alone , Raoul ?
Can anyone overhear what we say ?
I have seen him , Raoul !
I have seen the Phantom ! "
He is a monster - a loathsome beast !
You must saveme from him , Raoul !
Mlle. Carlotta , under the spell of his curse will never sing again .
Tomorrow I take her place in Faust .
I shall be at the stage door .
We will flee to England .
She has betrayed me !
Not that way - this way !
That was the Opera ghost !
- ERIK- Born during the Boulevard Massacre Self educated musican and master of Black Art
Exited to Devil 's Island for criminal insane
ESCAPED NOW AT LARGE
This is your man . Monsleur le Prefect
- The Phantom of the Opera ! "
At nine o 'clock the following evening a mysterious barouche stopped on the rotunda side of the Opera .
Wait for me at the west gate .
I have heard his voice once more , Raoul .
He knows our plans - - everything . "
Believe in my love , Raoul .
Save me from that monster - oh , save me !
My barouche is waiting outside .
We leave immediately after the performance !
Dry your tears , dear , and hasten - - you must make ready for your performance !
Come quick !
The strangler 's work again !
It was there !
I saw the body dangling in the air !
My brother - - poor Joseph , he knew too much about the Phantom !
The Punjab lasso - the strangler 's cord !
Assassin !
Fear for his brother 's safety , brought Comte de Chagny to the Opera house that night .
I think i can take you to Christine Daae - if you do exactly as I tell you .
Who are you that knows the Phantom 's secrets - and betrays them ?
I am Ledoux of the Secret Police .
I have studied this Phantom for months .
I found his hiding place deep within the torture chambers where he himself was confined during the second Revolution .
Keep your hand up - the strangler 's noose coils quick !
Your hand up - it is a matter of life or death
The discovery of this trap-door cost Joseph Buquet his life .
I am a messenger from the shadows
- - turn back ere ye perish !
You lied to me !
Do you think you and your lover could cheat the Phantom ?
Ungrateful fool !
You have spurned the spirit that inspired you
- - the spirit that made you great !
Now , you shall see the evil spirit that makes my evil face !
No Longer like a toad in these foul cellarswill i secrete the venom of hatred for you shall bring me love !
We should be within his hiding place , now .
We have fallen into the room of many mirrors the old torture chamber !
I am human like other men -
- I will not be cheated of my happiness !
Raoul ! Raoul !
My Brother - where are you ?
It seems we have callers .
Christine ! Christine !
Can you hear me ?
Your voice sounds near -
Try to find a door that will lead to us .
Look about you - try to learn where he keeps the keys .
The callers have departed .
I have discovered the Phantom 's hiding place
- tonight my brother will be avenged !
Did you hear voices ?
Perhaps we have more callers .
Heat - intolerable heat !
Fools - do they think they can match their wits against Erik ?
What do you offer for their lives ?
Your answer. quick - they can survive but a few moments !
Gunpowder !
You have your chance of saving him . Will you be the bride of Erik , or do you prefer to watch your lover die ?
Will you be the bride of Erik , or do you prefer to watch your lover die ?
If you turn the Scorpion - you have said ' Yes ' and spared de Chagny .
Turn the grasshopper - - and the Opera House is blown to a thousand bits !
I 'll do anything you say , if you will only save them !

The day before Christmas ...
And how is Hector McDonald , my Grandma 's little parrot seller ?
Don 't let her tease you , Hector .
Little Willie darling heard your voice .
He wants you to take him bye-bye .
You 're just an old darling , Hector .
I won 't tease you any more .
You 're makin a play for that guy !
Since when do you own me ?
If you tip that boob off to who we are , I 'll lay some lilies under your chin !
If you don 't stop yelling , you 'll tip him off yourself .
I 'll get a Mrs. O 'Grady .
I think you 'd better show the parrots .
They talk so well for you .
Echo , the ventriloquist , could make wooden dummies talk ... now watch the jolly parrots .
Isn 't it wonderful how the parrots always talk to your Grandma ?
That house , where you called about the parrot , was robbed last night .
This is Mr. Arlington .
The parrot you sold me doesn 't talk .
Here 's another parrot that won 't talk .
All right , I 'll come over .
I 'm sure when the bird sees me it will feel more at home .
The lady from the bird store , Mr. Arlington .
may I leave him here ?
He might cry if he sees the ...
B-I-R-D
Take mine , darling ... and Granny will get you some red beads just like those .
He 's always been so fond of beads !
Christmas Eve and then , Echo says to my , " Granny will get you some red beads just like those " !
Yes , and before morning Granny will have those pretty red beads .
Hector 's out there with a Christmas tree for little Willie .
Didn 't I order you to stay away from that guy ?
I wasn 't with him !
I met him on the corner headed for here !
Wait for me in the kitchen .
You go back to bed , Mrs. O 'Grady .
Rosie and I will trim the tree .
Get rid of him !
we 're gonna pull that Arlington job tonight .
Oh , I 'm mad at Granny !
She won 't stay in bed !
Perhaps she wants to help us trim the tree .
Yes , she 'd love to do some trimming .
That guy bossin me ...
me and my strength !
He 's too jealous to leave her with that boob .
Come on ... we 'll turn this trick alone !
I 've a secret I want you to share .
I 'm going to ask Rosie to merry me .
But I 'm not going to give her the ring until tomorrow .
You and your strength ! You 're yellow , you big stiff ... or you 'd come with me .
You heard me !
You 're yellow !
JOHN ARLINGTON MURDERED IN HOME BY JEWEL THIEVES .
'Oh , spare my life ' , said Mr. Arlington , ' spare my life ' !
You ... filth !
Don 't you realize that you 've murdered a man ?
That 's why I said we 'd never carry a gun !
Was there anybody beside yourselves know the rubies were here in the house ?
Ther was on old woman from a bird store who saw the rubies .
If you don 't want no part of these , because of how we got ' em ... then me and the Kid wll take ' em .
You 're gonna put ' em back in the safe with the rest of our stuff !
I 'm from Police Headquarters .
Oh , yes .
Isn 't it terrible ?
Mr. Arlington was one of my best customers .
You were at Mr. Arlington 's home yesteday , weren 't you ?
Did the man you saw with Mr. Arlington look as if he would commit such a crime ?
The reason I ask is because sometimes the least little thing gives us a clue .
I hate to see anybody tease a baby .
I don 't like to take his toys from him .
Let 's finish our talk in the store .
You sold a parrot to Mr. Arlington . Who delivered it ?
Oh !
So you delivered it yourself ?
You forget easy , don 't you ?
So long . I 'll see you later .
That dick has a line on us ... we gotta think fast !
He 's got a hunch Hector turneed this trick .
Let 's plant the jewels in the boob 's room !
That 's it !
Make him the fall guy !
That 's what we hired him for , isn 't it ...
in case we got in a jam ?
Christmas night ...
Don 't you think my savings are enough for us to start on ?
If I loved a man , he wouldn 't have to have a dime !
Oh !
If you loved a man !
Then why have you let me go on hoping ?
Aw , I 've just been kidding !
Oh , Hector , I tried so hard to let you know I love you ...
I 've been a crook ... a pick-pocket !
But you 're not going to be any more .
I did some pretty bad things myself ... when I was young .
Gee , but you 've made this a great Christmas , Rosie .
Gee , but you 've made this a great Christmas , Rosie !
Ain 't you the kidder ?
No , Echo , I 'm on the lovel .
I love him !
Thanks .
What are you going to do ?
You 'll find out soon enough !
Extry !
Extry !
Arlington murderer arrested !
What a bonehead I was to overlook that !
McDonald 's alibi , that he was at Mrs. O 'Grady bird store , will , be investigated by the police .
That means more investigation ... but there ain 't goin to be no Mrs. O 'Grady when they get here !
Yes there is goin to be a Mrs. O 'Grady ... that dick saw me here ...
You guys can get out of your make-up ... but I can 't !
¡ And I ain 't going to the chair alone !
And neither is Hector McDonald going to the chair !
Now , laugh that off ...
you big stiff !
What are you going to do ?
You 'll find out soon enough !
Regan is on his way to O 'Grady 's bird store .
Here 's one thing stronger that you ... and I might need him .
It was Spring before the grim machinery of the law worked around to the case of Hector McDonald .
Does the defendant 's attorney intend to produce the alleged witnesses , Mrs. O 'Grady and her grand-daught ?
127er 00 : 59 : 51,540 - - 00 : 59 : 56,050 We 're making every effort to locate them .
While in a secluded cabin in the mountains ...
In his prison cell he sits .
How about just us two dividing the stuff ?
Maybe I got a better palan .
You can save him , Echo .
And , if you will , I 'll stick with you .
I 'll never see Hector again .
Yes !
You 'd stick with me ...
but you 'd go on loving him .
... and the minute he 's free , you 'd double-cross me and go back to him .
Don 't you understand ... I 'll do anything to save him !
I love him , Echo ... I love him .
I 'd even take that from you .
After that , you don 't want to change your mind about sticking with me ?
He would always have Rosie ... if he saved Hector .
This was the thought that took Echo secretly to the city .
Your Honor , I object !
He is mis-stating the evidence !
Objection over-ruled !
Have you lawyer put you back on the witness stand . When you get there keep repeating the Lord 's prayer .
Move your lips But don 't utter a sound .
Have faith in miracles . Mrs. O 'Grady .
It 's Mrs. O 'Grady 's handwriting ...
and she 's not here !
Your Honor , may the defendant take the stand again to give new evidence ?
In a case so serious as his , with a man 's life at stake , the court cannot reasonably deny your request .
Speak louder !
Your Honor , and gentlemen of the jury ...
There was an old woman who was a man ...
and two others ... the Unholy Three ...
First , it was an old woman and her grand-daughter . Now , the old woman is a man !
What next ?
That wasn 't me talking !
I didn 't say a word !
... and it must be remembered that defense has failed to produce a single witness to confirm the prisoner 's story !
You mean ... you want me to go with you ?
There 's a fortune for just us two to split . What do you say ?
Do you think he 's guilty ?
Will he get the chair ?
I 'm Echo , the ventriloquist ...
Grandma O 'Grady of the ' Unholy Three ' !
Your Honor , I want to make a full confession !
The Law can be kind ...
And Echo 's confession won freedom for both himself and Hector .
Dear Hector :
I 'll never see you again ...
I can 't explain ... but always summber I love you , Hector ...
I love you .
Good Bya .
Rosie .
Echo , you remember what I promised if you saved Hector ?
Well ... I 'm here .
Aw , what 's the use of us kiddin , Rosie .
We don 't love each other .
You run along to Hector .
Do you really mean that , Echo ?
Good-by , old Pal !
That 's all there is to life , friends ... a little laughter ... a little tear ...

Great was the might of the African Sorcerer
In the city of the Caliph they were celebrating the ruler 's birthday
The Great Caliph
" A magic horse , Exalted Caliph , which flies through the air "
Princess Dinarzade , the Caliph 's daughter
Prince Achmed , her brother
" I will not part with this horse for mere gold ! "
" So choose any of my treasures "
" May I have whatever I desire ? "
" I swear it-by the Beard of the Prophet ! "
The Story of Prince Achmed
" How can one bring the horse back down to earth ? "
" The lever at the head drives it into the air ... "
" ... and the lever at the tail brings it to earth "
" Does the Prince know this ? "
Far from his homeland he landed on one of the magic islands of Waq Waq
The Prince was young , and brave and eager for adventure
" Who are you , maidens ? "
" We serve the Princess Peri Banu , ruler of the spirit land of Waq Waq "
" Stay with us , handsome stranger "
On a neighbouring island lay a magic lake ... where every night the exquisite Peri Banu and her attendants bathed
" Give back my cloak of feathers ! "
" Come with me to my beautiful homeland "
Thus was the Princess Peri Banu taken from the land of spirits
The horse carried them to far away China
" Do not be afraid of me "
" I am yours to command to the end of time "
" You do not know the power of the spirits of Waq Waq ! "
" They will kill you ! "
" Allah 's mercy will protect us if you will be my wife "
Meanwhile , the Sorcerer searched for his magic horse
" We will find our home and you will forget all about Waq Waq "
" I will follow you ! "
" The Prince sends you this garment "
" He bids me lead you to him "
Adventures in China
The Emperor of China
The Emperor 's Jester
Hither the Sorcerer brought Peri Banu to sell her to the Emperor
The Emperor smiled upon Peri Banu
" Kill her , or take her to wife ! "
" Now , my brave Prince , I shall return to your sister "
In this mountain dwelt the Sorcerer 's greatest enemy the Fire Mountain Witch
" How dare you come to my magic mountain ? "
" The African Sorcerer brought me hither "
" He is my greatest enemy ! "
" And we are friends "
The Bridegroom
" Help me free Peri Banu "
" I fear no spirits ! "
" With these weapons you can conquer the spirits "
The Bride
Far below , at that moment , the wedding of Peri Banu
" We must stop the wedding "
The spirits of Waq Waq look for their mistress
" Take me to Waq Waq "
THE GATES OF WAQ WAQ OPEN ONLY TO THE ONE WHO THE MAGIC LAMP OF ALADDIN POSSESSES
Aladdin and the Magic Lamp
" I am Aladdin "
" Where is the Magic Lamp ? "
" Do you not have it ? "
" I will tell you "
" I was a poor tailor in the city of the Caliph "
" One day I was visited by a mysterious stranger "
" Behold Dinarzade , the daughter of the Caliph "
" You shall have her , once you do something for me "
" He led me to a high mountain "
The Magic Lamp
" Fetch the Lamp "
" Give me the Lamp ! "
" First let me out ! "
" Then die !
I have other ways to obtain the Lamp ! "
" I languished long in the dark cave until I succeeded in lighting the Lamp "
" What is your command , O Master ? "
" I am your servant , I and all the Spirits of the Lamp "
" Take me home "
" Now I knew I could win the Princess Dinarzade "
" In a single night I built her a splendid palace "
" Next morning the astounded Caliph visited the enchanted building "
" So she became my wife "
" The Caliph is my father , Dinarzade-my sister "
" Tell me , what happened further ? "
" One day everything vanished - the palace , Dinarzade and the Lamp "
" I fled before the fury of the Caliph "
" I set out to sea "
" A fearful storm blew up "
" And so you found me "
" Do you know who did this to you ? "
" The African Sorcerer ! "
" He loved Dinarzade "
" Hurry , Achmed , and free Peri Banu "
" The spirits want to kill her , because she left to follow you "
" The Sorcerer has stolen the Magic Lamp "
" Only the Lamp can open the gates of Waq Waq "
" Kill the Sorcerer and the Lamp is yours ! "
" Kill him ! "
" I will try "
" Your enemy is dead ! "
The Spirit Battle of Waq Waq
The spirits rose up against their faithless mistress
" Prince Achmed stands before the gates ! "
" Bring out Peri Banu ! "
" Summon the Spirits of the Lamp , Aladdin ! "
Yet the spirits of darkness came before him
Aladdin was overwhelmed
" The Lamp ! "
The Witch intervened
Now legions of benevolent spirits streamed out of the Magic Lamp
" Behold !
The palace ! "
" Return and seek happiness in the land of mortals "
" Dinarzade must be in the palace "
The towers of the Caliph 's city soon appeared before them
" Aladdin 's palace has returned ! "
Meanwhile , the call to morning prayer sounded from the minarets
Buster Keaton in " Battling Butler "
" Alfred , your father thinks a hunting and fishing trip in the mountains might do you a lot of good . "
" Yes - get a camping outfit - - go out and rough it .
Maybe it will make a man out of you if you have to take care of yourself for a while . "
" Arrange it . "
And so Alfred went out to rough it , leaving the city behind - there was no other place to leave it .
" There doesn 't seem to be a thing here to shoot . "
" Isn 't she pretty ? "
" This is my papa and brother . "
" Have you any more brothers or fathers ? "

" Shall I arrange it ? "
" Mr. Butler would like to marry you . "
" That jellyfish couldn 't take care of himself - - let alone a wife . "
" We don 't want any weaklings in our family . "
" Weakling ! You don 't know who he is . "
" What 's he doing here - training ? "
Advice to the Lovesick by Beatrice Faircatch I have outlined the following proposal , with the answers you may expect :
He - " I 'm crazy about you . " She - " This is so sudden . " He - " You 're the only girl I ever loved . " She - " Give me time to think . " He - " No , I must know now . " She - " Have you ever proposed to any other girl ? "

" I have . "
" When are you going to fight again ? "
" When I 'm drafted . "
" I mean , who do you fight next ? "
" Yes . "
" Sir , it 's time to take your liniment . "
" These people will never know the difference - the champion will win and no one will ever hear of Battling Butler again . "
" If you 're going to fight tomorrow you 'll have to hurry to catch the train . "
" Arrange the train . "
" In this corner we have Battling Butler . "
Butler 's trainer and manager .
" - the Lightweight Champion . "
" The Alabama Murderer challenges the winner . "
" I 'm champion . "
" That means you cannot go back to the mountains , sir . "
" You 're wrong , I 'm going back and tell her the truth .
I 'd rather lose her that way . "

" That means you have to leave right away . "
" Arrange it . "
" I 'll hurry and pack my things . "
" I 'm sorry , but you can 't go . "
" I want you to know me as I am - - not as the brutal , blood-thirsty beast that I am when fighting . "
" Promise me you will never come near the training camp or to see me fight . "
" Where do we go from here ? "
" We 'd better go to Butler 's training camp , sir , so that you can answer her letters from there . "
SILVER HOT SPRINGS Hotel Register Alfred Battling Butler Wife .
" Drive carefully .
These country folks may not be used to city speed . "
Alfred Battling Butler Wife . Alfred Butler and Man .
" How 's your heel ? "
" He 's all right . "
" Let 's go out for a little road work . "
Eight miles later .
" I 'm glad you came to see me - - now you must go right back home . "
" I won 't go home !
I 'm going to stay right here and help you train . "
" Compliments of Mr. Butler . "
" That woman says she 's married to you , too . "
" - - so you see , sir , it would wreck his home if she knew the truth .
Won 't you be a good fellow and fix it for him . "

" I 'm through - get him in shape the best you can . "
" Don 't you think it advisable , sir , to give this up ? "
" No , Martin , I 'd rather be killed by the Alabama Murderer than have her know . "
" Put up your hands . "
By dinner time the only thing Alfred had on his mind was his stomach .
And so for three weeks Alfred trained and starved and suffered and ached and bled and groaned and hoped and prayed and - and then came the storm .

THE END Subtitle by Reza Fa
SECRET OF A SOUL a Psychoanalytic Film
Inside every person there are desires and passions which remain unknown to " consciousness " .
In the dark hours of psychological conflict these " unconscious " drives attempt to assert themselves ... . ... Mysterious illnesses arise from such struggles , the resolution and cure of which form the field of psychoanalysis .
In the hands of the " psycho - analytically trained " doctor the teaching of university professor Sigmund Freud represent an important advance in the treatment of these types of psychological illnesses .
The events in this film are taken from life .
They do not deviate in any important factual way from the actual medical case history .
" HELP ! "
" Last night ...
with a razor ... ! "
" Come ...
Papa 's expecting us ! "
Woman Gruesomely Murdered
" I 'm from the homicide department .
We 'd like to know if you observed anything relevant to the crime committed last night in the house nearby . "
" No ... we just heard the cries for help this morning ! "
Meanwhile ... a surprise was waiting by the hearth .
" My friends !
I am finally swimming toward home Sumatra lies behind me , and in a short while I shall be with you I am sending these 'guest present ' on ahead . "
The Dream
Sincerely Your Cousin Hans
" I dreamt terrible things ...
It was horrible ... ! "
" Your wife says that her cousin has arrived . "
" You must excuse me ...
I cannot eat with you . "
" I can 't touch the knife ! "
" You left this key lying in the café ! "
" Is there some reason you 're reluctant to enter your house ? "
" Sorry , it 's part of my job . "
" My friend left his house last night , greatly agitated and has not yet returned .
We 're very concerned ... "
" We fear an accident ...
since the murder in the neighboring house my husband has been completely distraught ... "
" We 've received no reports of any accidents Incidentally , the murderer was arrested today in Munich ! "
" ... and worst of all last night I felt a sudden compulsion to kill my wife whom I love more than anything ... ! "
" Do you know of no one who can help you ? "
" You mean Dr. Orth .
He lives just across the way . "
" I didn 't expect that we would meet again so soon . "
" I 'm coming to you because I 'm totally distraught !
... ... Tormented by inexplicable fears ... !
... It is impossible for me to touch a knife ... ! "
" We do know of such illneses ... and also of the possibility of their cure . "
" But that 's not all ... ! "
" I am happily married and yet ... yesterday evening I was overcome with an almost irresistible urge to kill my wife ...
isn 't that crazy ... ? "
" No ... but it may be a sign of serious psychological illness ! "
" There 's no reason to despair . "
" Perhaps I can help you .
There is a method called psychoanalysis that I like to apply with such illnesses . "
" I 've reserved a room at a hotel .
Believe me , it 's better that way . "
" I 'm taking charge of your husband 's treatment . "
" It is better during the treatment period , which will last several months , that your husband does not live at home . "
" That is everything , doctor ! "
No ... that is by no means everything .
You can be cured only when we have worked together to uncover the ' unconscious ' psychological conflicts which led to your illness ! "
" You will start by telling me everything you see in your mind 's eye ! "
" Don 't hold back anything because you think it is unimportant or nonsensical ! "
" Thoughts will come up that you may not wish to express Tell them to me anyway . "
" A few day ago ... in the morning in my wife 's bedroom ... I suddenly heard ... "
" HELP ! "
" Last night ...
with a razor ... ! "
" The impressions of that morning shook you greatly psychologically Had you recently quarreled with your wife ? "
" No ! "
" I grew up with my wife ... Marriage to her has given my life its meaning . "
" We were deeply in love , and wanted children ... but ... "
" Did something ... happen ... to cause you to give up hope of progeny ? "
" I don 't know ...
but lately I have been plagued by terrible fantasies I have seen my wife in shameful situations ... ! "
" What are the characteristics of this man who has appeared to you in these fantasies ? "
" Wait a minute ... ! "
it 's my childhood friend my wife 's cousin . "
" Did your wife give you a reason to be jealous of her cousin ? "
" He is my best friend .
Shortly after our wedding he left us ...
to go to the tropics I was never consciously jealous of him ...
" As he took his leave from us ... I felt a strange emotion stirring in me ... "
" Then , years went by .
On the day before the outbreak of my illness we received a letter from him that he was returning ... "
Months passed of arduous work by doctor and patient Finally today ...
an important new memory rose to consciousness in the parlent .
" On the night before the outbreak of my illness there was a bad storm . "
" I had terrible dreams that night ! "
" Since we have learned to interpret it the dream has become the most important door to our knowledge of the unconscious ! "
" The images are muddled ... "
" I don 't want to look at them ! "
" You may not give in to this resistance ! "
" Arriving today at 10 : 30 a.m. ... Cousin Hans . "
" When I got the telephone message that our cousin had arrives ... "
" That is a typical mistake to make when receiving news that is ' unconsciously' unwelcome . "
" In the dream I stood before an Indian idol ... "
Sincerely Your Cousin Hans
" Why is this exotic image in your dream ? "
" In the dream , a small Italian city one I saw frequently on our honeymoon emerged before my eyes A bell tower grew steeply up out of the ground ... "
" The laughing of these three women 's heads was terrible ! "
" Did you recognize the women ? "
" These humiliations hit you in your most vulnerable spot ! "
" Then , in the dream , I stood before a prison cell and looked through the bars . "
" What did you see ? "
" In your nightmare , the small wound on your wife 's neck flowed together with the crime in the nearby house for this reason you saw yourself condemned as a murderer . "
" These dream fantasies led , in your consciousness to a morbid aversion to touching a knife . "
" So this psychological illness kept you from killing your wife ! "
" Were you finished with your dream of the trial ? "
" No ...
I saw water ...
turbulent , dark water ! "
" It has long been known that dreams of water signify ' imminent ' or 'wished for ' birth ... ! "
" She gives the doll to her cousin ! "
" Did you ever experience anything similar in your childhood ? "
" Back then she gave 'our ' doll to her cousin ! "
" The pain that you experienced when your wife gave ' our doll ' to her cousin has remained awake in your childless marriage ! "
" In the dream I got into a furious rage ... "
" Have you notices what you 're holding in your hand ? "
" I am able to touch a knife again ... "
" I 've got a lot to apologize for ! "
Epilogue
THE END english subtitles transcribed by . : Norgen ( norgen @ centrum.cz ) : .
Soon after its premiere , the film Metropolis was severely truncated and alterations were made .
From that time onward , more than a quarter of the film was assumed to have been lost .
Then , in 2008 , a virtually complete version of the film was discovered in Buenos Aires .
What had been preserved was , however , a heavily damaged copy of the film that had been printed to 16mm film stock , lacking the full frame of the picture 's original aspect ratio .
A considerable amount of the film reconstruction was able to be completed and the correct sequence of its editing established by means of this Argentinian material .
Spanish intertitles have been translated into German with the aid of the censor-cards .
In order to display in their correct position on the image the cropped elements taken from the 16mm negative , the missing portion of the frame has been marked by black .
The intertitles appear with their original graphic treatment .
Those titles which appear in a different typeface ( like the one used here ) have been added to summarise the content of still-missing scenes as far as is necessary to facilitate an adequate understanding of the storyline .
Shorter gaps are indicated by small segments of black leader .

Epigraph :
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART !
Shift change .
Deep beneath the earth lay the City of the Workers .
As deep beneath the earth as the City of the Workers lay , so high above it towered the complex known as the " Sons ' Club " , with its lecture halls and libraries , its theatres and stadiums .
Fathers , for whom every revolution of a mechanical wheel meant gold , had bestowed upon their sons the wonder of the Eternal Gardens .
Which of you ladies shall today have the honour of entertaining Master Freder , Joh Fredersen 's son ?
Look !
These are your brothers !
Look - !
These are your brothers !
Who - was that ?
But this was what happened to Freder - the son of Joh Fredersen , the master of Metropolis - as he sought out the girl :
To the new Tower of Babel - to my father - !
Why is it , Josaphat , that I learn of this explosion from my son , and not from you - !
Details - !
What were you looking for in the Machine-Halls , Freder ?
I wanted to look into the faces of the people whose little children are my brothers , my sisters ...
Your magnificent city , Father - and you the brain of this city - and all of us within the light of this city ... - ... and where are the people , Father , whose hands built your city - ?
Off where they belong off where they belong ... ?
... in the Depths ... ?
And if those in the Depths one day rise against you ?
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine , Grot , - with an important message ...
There were two more copies of those damnable plans , Herr Fredersen in the pockets of two men who met with an accident today at the M-Machine ...
How is it , Josaphat , that these plans were brought to me by Grot , rather than by you ?
Apply to the G-Bank for your remaining wages ...
Father , do you know what it means to be dismissed by you ?
It means : To be sent below !
- Father - below !
Into the Depths - !
Do you know what it means to be dismissed like that by Joh Fredersen ?
Would you like to come with me , Josaphat ?
Go home , Josaphat , and wait for me ...
I still have a long way to go tonight ...
Into the Depths , - to my brothers ...
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed of my son 's every move ...
Brother the Machine !
ME .
Listen to me ...
I want to trade my life with you ...
Josaphat .
99th Block . House 7 , 7th Floor .
Wait for me - both of you ...
Josaphat .
In the middle of Metropolis , there stands a strange house that the centuries had overlooked .
The man who dwelled within was Rotwang , the inventor .
Hel
Born to bring me happiness and a benediction to all mankind .
Lost to Joh Fredersen .
Died giving life to Freder , Joh Fredersen 's son .
A mind like yours , Rotwang , should be able to forget ...
Only one time in life did I forget something :
that Hel was a woman - and you a man ...
Let the dead lie , Rotwang ...
She 's dead for you as she is for me ...
For me she isn 't dead , Joh Fredersen - for me she lives - !
Do you think the loss of a hand is too high a price for recreating Hel - ?
!
Do you wish to see her - ?
!
Now , Joh Fredersen - ?
!
Isn 't it worth losing a hand to have created the man of the future - the Machine-Man - ? !
24 more hours of work - and no man , Joh Fredersen , will be able to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal - !
The woman is mine , Joh Fredersen !
Hel 's son was yours !
And what brings you my way , Joh Fredersen ?
I need your advice - as usual , when all my experts fail me ...
Can you decipher for me these plans that for months have been getting discovered in the pockets of my workers ?
... at two ... once my shift ends !
She has summoned us again ...
Father - !
Father - !
Will ten hours never come to an end - ? !
!
- it 's a blueprint of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs deep below the lowest levels of your Metropolis ...
I should like to glean what my workers are doing exactly in those catacombs ...
Today I shall tell you the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOWER OF BABEL ...
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TOWER OF BABEL
Come !
Let us build a tower whose zenith shall reach unto the stars !
And at the tower 's zenith we shall write :
Great is the world and its Maker !
And great is Man !
... but those who had conceived of the Tower of Babel could not build the Tower of Babel .
The task was too great .
So they paid wages to outside hands ...
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel knew nothing of the dream of which the head that had conceived it had been fantasising .
The hymns of praise of one man became the curses of others .
The same language was spoken , but these men did not understand one another ...
Great is the world and its Maker and great is Man
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator .
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART !
And where is our Mediator , Maria - ?
Wait for him !
He will surely come !
We will wait , Maria ... !
But not for much longer - !
Oh Mediator , have you finally come ...
You summoned me - here I am !
Rotwang , give the Machine-Man the likeness of this woman ...
I shall sow discord between them and her !
I shall destroy their belief in this woman -
Leave me alone now , Joh Fredersen ...
You 'll find the way back without me ...
Now you shall also lose the last remaining thing you still had from Hel ... your son ...
Until tomorrow , in the cathedral !
END OF THE PRELUDE
INTERMEZZO
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit who preaches :
" Verily , I say unto you : the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh ! "
The monk 's hand points to the Bible , in which it is written :
" And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns . And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , having a golden cup in her hand . And upon her forehead was a name written , a mystery :
BABYLON THE GREAT , the Mother of Abominations ofthe Earth .
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood ofthe Saints . "
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen - him and his city and his son - !
GLUTTONY
AVARICE
PRIDE
LUST
ENVY
ANGER
SLOTH
Had you come earlier , you wouldn 't have frightened me ...
I now beg of you : stay away from me and my beloved ... !
Where is the one whose clothes you are wearing ?
Josaphat .
99th Block . House 7 , 7th Floor .
Would you please wake Georgy up ?
He must lead me to the Workers ' City at once ... No. 11811 , get back to the Machine and forget that you ever left it - understood ?
I have to have someone who 's faithful to me , Josaphat , - otherwise , how shall I attain the end-goal of my path - ?
I must go on , Josaphat , - must now , on my own , seek out the person to whom Georgy was supposed to lead me ...
Tonight , Josaphat - tonight when I come back ...
Josaphat .
99th Block . House 7 , 7th Floor .
So , what price are you demanding for leaving this residence tonight ?
You still don 't seem to have grasped who sent me here ...
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS
This man doesn 't want his son to find you still here tonight !
In three hours ' time I shall be calling for you !
Come !
It is time to give the Man-Machine your face !
Where is Maria - ?
!
She 's with your father ...
I 'm telling you , she is with your father - !
" She is the most perfect and most obedient tool that a man has ever possessed !
Tonight you shall see how she holds up before the eyes ofthe upper hundred .
You shall see her dance , and if only one single person recognises the machine in her , I will call myself a bungler who never succeeded at anything !
C. Rotwang "
" C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening . "
I want you to go to those in the Depths in order to annihilate the work of your prototype !
" C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen to be his guest this evening . "
Verily , I say unto you : the days of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh ... !
All Seven Deadly Sins , on her behalf - !
Death overtakes the City - !
END OF THE INTERMEZZO
The Revelation of St. John Avalun Publishing , Hellerau
I escaped from the Thin Man wearing this attire ...
But for ten days your father 's bloodhound has been making the Workers ' City unsafe ...
The only thing keeping the workers in check is their expectation for the Mediator promised unto them ...
Even stranger things have been happening , Freder ...
On that evening when you fell ill once the best of friends ...
because of that woman the other man ...
on that same evening the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned ...
but night after night in Yoshiwara ...
And this woman , at whose feet all sins are heaped is also called Maria ...
That same woman that those in the Depths regard as a saint - ?
!
Many now go to the City of the Dead , to a woman they have judged to be as true as gold .
The Mediator is not likely to miss that occasion ...
Whatever happens tonight :
it is my express order to allow the workers to do as they please ...
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths use force and do wrong so that he can claim the right to use force against them ...
When you spoke to your poor brothers , you talked about peace , Maria ... today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen incites them to rebel against him ...
She will destroy their belief in the Mediator !
You know I 've always talked about peace ...
but your Mediator hasn 't come ...
You 've waited long enough !
Your time has come - !
... but I 've tricked Joh Fredersen !
Your clone does not obey his will - only mine alone !
Who is the living fodder for the machines for Metropolis - ?
!
Who smears the machine-joints with their own marrow - ?
!
Who feeds the machines with their own flesh - ? !
Let the machines starve , you fools - !
Finish them off - ! !
Do them in - these machines - ! !
You aren 't Maria - !
!
!
YOU ARE NOT MARIA - !
Maria talks of peace , not murder - !
This is not Maria - ! !
Joh Fredersen 's son - ! !
Do him in , the dog , in his white silken hide - ! ! !
Get your women , your sons , out of the Workers ' City !
Let no-one stay behind !
Death to the machines - ! ! !
In the attic of his home ,
Rotwang displays for Maria his ever-growing intoxication with his triumph over Fredersen :
" - and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen - !
For I concealed from him that his son wants to be the Mediator of your brothers - and is in love with you - ! "
Maria isn 't the only one listening to Rotwang .
On the other side of the attic 's window , Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping ...
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang 's attic .
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him .
Maria is free .
... faithful after all ...
Come , Freder !
We still have to go through the Workers ' City .
Women and men , let no-one miss out on today - !
Death to the machines - ! !
Not one man - not one woman has stayed behind - !
Leave the machines - !
Let them race to their death - !
To the Heart-Machine - !
DANGER
Open the gates !
You have to open the gates !
If the Heart-Machine perishes , nothing in the Machine-District will be left standing - ! !

Buster Keaton in College
On the sunkist slopes of the Pacific , where land and water meet - -
High School Graduation Day , where the next step is either go to college or go to work .
A few drops of rain couldn 't dampen a mother 's enthusiasm on her son 's Graduation Day .
Mary Haynes - winner of every popularity contest in which the boys were allowed to vote .
Jeff Brown - Star athlete , who believed so much in exercise that he made many a girl walk home .
" I didn 't think you would call for me in the rain .
" Young man , it 's time you graduated .
" I know you are going to be as popular at Clayton College as you were here . "
" It is my pleasure to present this diploma to our most brilliant scholar . "
" - and your scholastic record richly merits this honor medal . "
" Ronald will now speak on the ' Curse of Athletics ' . "
" The secret of getting a medal like mine is - - books not sports . "
" The student who wastes his time on athletics rather than study shows only ignorance . "
" Future generations depend upon brains and not upon jumping the discus or hurdling the javelin . "
" What have Ty Ruth or Babe Dempsey done for Science ? "
" Where would I be without my books ? "
" Your speech was ridiculous .
Anyone prefers an athlete to a weak-knee 'd , teachers ' pet . "
" When you change your mind about athletics , then I 'll change my mind about you . "
" Mary is going to enter Clayton ... I wish I could go . "
" I 'm afraid we can 't afford it , dear . "
" I can work my way through . Other boys do . "
So the following term , Ronald arrived at Clayton , and was met by ...
" I need another clerk as good as he is . "
" You can commence tomorrow . "
" Well , if it isn 't the student prince . "
Your principal writes me what an excellent student you are . "
" A boy like you can make this athlete-infested college a seat of learning once more . "
" You boys will do well to follow the example of this young scholar . "
Sunday found Ronald taking " fizzical " exercise .
" You play third base for the second team . "
" You forced two men out and you 're out too . "
WANTED Colored Waiter
" Bring me something you can 't stick your thumb in . "
Clayton 's wonder track team training for the intercollegiate meet .
" Don 't get too interested in that campus clown . -
- You 're supposed to be going with me . "
" You take an awful lot for granted . "
A call to the Dean 's office meant only one thing - GRIEF
" You have been a miserable failure in all your studies and I know the reason why . "
" I took up athletics because the girl I love thinks I 'm a weakling . "
" I love her and would do anything to please her . "
" I understand , my boy .
The same thing happened to me , but I was stubborn .
" Here 's a list of the men eligible for the rowing crew . "
" Coach , I 'd like to have you make this young man coxswain of the crew . "
" His size and weight are perfect and he has brains . "
" Clayton can 't lose the boat race now .
" Boys , get out the smelling salts - -
" It 's the Dean 's orders .
" - unless something happens to the poor boy . "
The day of the race .
" Hey , coach - nothing has happened to Mama 's boy ! "
" Don 't worry - you 're coxswain .
Give him this and he 'll wake up just in time for the football season . "
If you were seen in my room it would mean expulsion for me ! "
" That 's just what I want .
I was expelled this morning and thought I would like to take you with me . "
" I 'm going to stay here until we are discovered - then you might change your mind about marrying me . "
" Boys , we 've got to win !
If we don 't , rowing will be a thing of the past at Clayton ! "
" Is Ronald our coxswain to-day ? "
" Certainly not .
The rival crew , ready for their most important race of the year .
" Go on , they are waiting for you .
" Hurry - Jeff has me locked here in my room , and he - "
" Young lady , do you know what this means ? "
" Yes - it means we are going to be married . "

The recent death of " Prof. " Powers has left his daughter Mary with the problem of carrying on the medicine show .
Flash " , I 'm sorry I let you persuade me to keep on with the show .
Forget it , Mary .
It wouldn 't be a show without you .
Besides , everything 's going to be O.K.
Sheriff Jim Hickory and his two oldest sons have made the family name famous throughout the country .
Harold , the youngest Hichory , was born on April Fool 's Day .
The stork that brought him could hardly fly for laughing .
We 'll be leaving for the meeting directly ...
how about my Sunday shirt ?
If anything happens to that shirt , young man , I 'll whale the life out of you .
Hank Hooper , Harold 's sworn enemy ever since Harold sold him a dozen door knobs for fresh eggs in the dark .
Well , I see the town raised the money for the dam all right .
It will be a big thing for Hickoryville .
And a bigger thing for you ... eh , Sheriff ?
Son , how many times have I told you we don 't want any more trouble with these Hickorys ?
Where is this metropolis of Hickoryville ... and who signs the permits for the shows there ?
Sheriff Jim Hickory ...
but he ain 't got any use for medicine shows ... he run the last one out of town .
You stay here , son ...
the town meeting 's no place for boys .
Hi , Sheriff !
I 've brought this show all the way from New York just to play your wonderful city .
Sheriff , I 'd like you to autograph this little permit .
STOP !

How does that sound to you ?
Now you boys can sign it .
Goin ' to the show ?
That big medicine show in the village .
Who gave them permission to play here ?
I thought I 'd mail our letter .
Did you give them permission ?
As you seem to be taking over the duties of sheriff ...
go down and stop the show .
This medicine is not only good for man and beast but is recommended as a furniture polish and for cleaning harness .
My father sent me down to stop the show ...
if you don 't mind .
Now folks , on the count of three , this trick will prove that the little sheriff is out of sight .
Now folks , we will again be entertained by our little beauty !
If you don 't stop the show , I 'll have you arrested .
Where 's your authority ?
One moment , Sheriff , I 've got a little present for you ... first .
I 'm giving you 24 hours to get out of here !
I 'll get the key , Mr. Hickory ...
The kid is as much at fault as anybody .
I 'll attend to him when we get home .
Will these do for tonight ?
Would you get me a glass of water , please ?
Wouldn 't you rather have some hot coffee ?
It 's the wind .
Me and mama have come to take the girl home .
She can 't stay here where there 's no womenfolks .
It ain 't decent .
I suppose I 'd better go .
Will you go with me to the celebration for the dam tomorrow ?
Good night , Mary ...
I 'm going to sleep in the barn .
Next morning ...

The Act Over .
" What 's the matter ? "
" You hardly got a laugh ! "

Time brought many changes to the Circus ;
New Hopes and New Ambitions .
His New Ambition .
" Never mind the rope . "
" You 'd better try and be funny again or you 'll go ! "
The next performance - and not a smile .
" I 've had enough of this ; "
" You get one more chance . "
" Where 's Rex ? "
" Rex , the tight-rope walker , hasn 't shown up . "
" Is Rex here ? "
" You can do the act , can 't you ? "
" You 'll do it or quit ! "
" I 'll do it ;
find his clothes ! "

" You follow her ! "
" He 'll kill himself . "

THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC
A film by Carl Th . Dreyer
At the Bibliotheque de la Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world :
The record of the trial of Joan of Arc , the trial that ended in her death .
The questions of the judges and Joan 's responses were recorded exactly .
Reading it , we discover the real Joan , not in armor , but simple and human ... a young woman who died for her country . And we are witness to an amazing drama :
A young , pious woman , confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges .
I swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ... nothing but the truth ...
In France I 'm called Joan ... in my village , I 'm called Jeannette .
How old are you ?
Nineteen ...
I think .
Do you know the Lord 's Prayer ?
Who taught it to you ?
My mother .
Will you recite it ?
You claim to be sent by God ?
To save France ... it 's why I was born .
So you think God hates the English ?
I don 't know if God loves or hates the English ... but I do know that the English will all be chased from France ... except those that die here !
You have said that St. Michael appeared to you ... in what form ?
Did he have wings ?
Did he wear a crown ?
How was he dressed ?
How did you know if it was a man or a woman ?
Was he naked ?
Do you think God was unable to clothe him ?
Did he have long hair ?
Why would he have cut it ?
Why do you wear men 's clothing ?
If we give you women 's clothing , would you wear it ?
When the mission that God has entrusted to me is over , I will again dress as a woman .
So it is God who orders you to dress as a man ?
And what reward do you expect from Our Lord ?
The salvation of my soul .
You blaspheme God .
This is disgraceful .
For me , she is a saint .
Has God made you promises ?
That has nothing to do with your trial .
Shouldn 't we let the judges decide that ?
Shall we put this question to a vote ?
So !
What has God promised you ?
Perhaps that you will be delivered from prison ?
When ?
I know neither the day ... nor the hour .
Since she couldn 't be made to confess easily , we will have to be clever .
Go find a letter bearing the signature of King Charles .
Write the letter that I will dictate .
I have great pity for you !
Do you know the signature of your King ?
I have a letter from him to you .
I can 't read .
To our beloved Joan ...
I am preparing to march on Rouen with a mighty army .
I send you this devoted priest , have confidence in him .
Just as Jesus is the son of God , you claim to be the daughter of God ?
Will you now recite the Lord 's Prayer ?
God has told you that you shall be delivered from prison ?
By a great victory !
God has promised you that you will go to Heaven ?
So you are certain of being saved ?
Be careful , it 's a dangerous answer .
Since you are sure of your salvation , then you have no need of the Church ?
Are you in a state of grace ?
Well ! Respond !
Are you in a state of grace ?
If I am , may God keep me there .
If I am not , may God grant it to me !
Father ... permit me to attend Mass .
Joan , if we permit you to attend Mass ... will you stop wearing men 's clothes ?
So , you would rather dress as a man than attend Mass ?
These shameless clothes ... abominable to God ...
You are no daughter of God .
You are Satan 's creature !
Go prepare the torture chamber .
She really looks like a daughter of God .
In the torture chamber .
Look at your judges .
Don`t you feel that these learned doctors are wiser than you ?
But God is even wiser !
Listen , Joan , we know that your visions do not come from God ... but from the devil .
How do you know a good angel from an evil angel ?
You have knelt before Satan , not St. Michael !
Don 't you see that it 's the Devil who has turned your head ... who has tricked you ... and betrayed you ?
I think she 's ready to abjure !
The Church opens its arms to you . If you reject it , the Church will abandon you and you will be alone ... alone !
Yes , alone ... alone with God !
Even if you part my soul from my body I will revoke nothing ... and if I say something , later I will say it was forced from me !
Not for anything in the world do I want her to die a natural death .
She is very weak .
She has a fever ... we must bleed her .
Be careful , she could end her own life ... she 's very crafty .
Bring the Sacraments .
Is there something you wish to tell us ?
I fear to be in great danger of death ... and if I die , I ask you to bury my body in sacred ground .
The Church is merciful ... it always welcomes the misguided lamb .
Joan , we all want what 's best for you .
Look , I have sent for the Sacraments .
I am a good Christian .
Don`t you know it is the Body of the Lord that you refuse ?
Do you not see that you outrage God by your obstinacy ?
I love and honor God ...
with all my heart .
You claim ... that I am ...
sent by the devil .
It 's not true ... to make me suffer , the devil has sent you ... and you ... and you ... and you ...
There is nothing left to be done ... alert the torturer !
Let us try one last time to save this lost soul ...
It is to you , Joan , that I speak .
It is to you that I say that your King is a heretic !
My King is the most noble Christian of all Christians .
The arrogance of this woman is insane .
France has never seen such a monster .
I have never wronged anyone .
If you do not sign , you will be burned alive ...
See the torturer who awaits .
You don 't have the right to die .
Your King still needs you .
Joan , sign ...
and save your life !
Joan , we have great pity for you .
Sign , Joan !
In the name of the Lord .
Amen .
Since you recognized your errors , we exonerate you from the bonds of excommunication .
But because you have greatly sinned , we condemn you ... to perpetual imprisonment with the bread of sorrow and the water of anguish .
You made a good day 's work :
you have saved your life and your soul .
She has only made fools of you !
Long live Joan !
Go find the judges !
I take it back , I have lied ...
Hurry !
I have committed a great sin ... I have denied God ... to save my life . But , Joan , before the people you have confessed that you were inspired by the devil .
You still believe you were elect by the Lord ?
That answer is equivalent to death .
I acknowledged from fear of the fire .
Have you anything else to tell us ?
We have come to prepare you for death .
Now ... already ?
Which death ?
At the stake .
I 'll bring the last Sacrament .
Tell me , how can you still believe that you are sent by God ?
His ways are not our ways .
Yes , I am His child .
And the great victory ?
My martyrdom !
And your deliverance ?
Death !
Will you take confession ?
May the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ keep thy soul ... in everlasting life .
Be courageous , Joan .
Your last hour is close .
Dear sweet God , I accept death with a good heart ... but do not let me suffer too long .
Will I be with You tonight in Paradise ?
Jesus !
You have burned a saint !
The flames sheltered Joan 's soul as it rose to heaven .
Joan whose heart has become the heart of France ...
Joan whose memory will always be honoured by the people of France .

Schigolch !
You 've come a long way
We haven 't seen each other for ages
Do you still dance ?
You 've forgotten ewerything .
You should have stayed with me
In the old garret ?
I 'd have run away
Chief Editor Dr. Schön looks after you nicely but he can 't guarantee our future
You deserve to appear before a big audience .
I 've brought along just the man for that
Rodrigo Quast .
He wants to stage a variety act with you
Dr. Schön is coming !
I 'm getting married
Won 't you kiss me , just because you 're getting married ?
Our relationship is the talk of the town .
I 'm risking my position
Don 't you understand it 's all over between us ?
You 'll have to kill me if you want to be free of me
He was my first ... patron
One does one 's best
End of Act One Act Two
The Minister of the Interior , Dr. von Zamikov , wishes to announce the marriage of his daughter Charlotte Marie Adelaide to Dr. Ludwig Schön
I warn you again :
Dr. Schön 's behaviour makes this marriage impossible
Father , I 'm not bothered by what people say
Here are the costume designs for your revue , Alwa
What is Lulu doing ?
Father must give her up .
His wedding cannot be postponed any longer
The famous Rodrigo Quast wants to do a big variety act with me .
We 're rehearsing
Alwa is my best friend .
He is the only one who wants nothing from me
Or perhaps you want nothing from me because you don 't love me ?
Dear Geschwitz , you must design such a costume for me
Is she really this beautiful ?
I forbade you to come here !
I haven 't come to see you
Alwa
Please get me Volume K of the dictionary
Very well .
Come and see me tomorrow
Why don 't you marry Lulu , Father ?
One doesn 't marry such women .
That would be suicide
What did she want ?
She wants to be in variety .
Someone wants to do a trapeze act with her
No trapeze !
Use her in your revue .
My newspaper will guarantee its success
One thing more : beware of that woman
End of Act Two Act Three
Nonsense !
Wouldn 't you rather do the trapeze act with me ?
I 'm not going on !
Bring her to her senses !
We 'll do our variety act after all
I 'll dance for the whole world , but not for that woman
Tell them to start
Where is Lulu ?
Smoking forbidden here !
Satisfied , Alwa ?
Now I 'll marry Lulu .
It will be the death of me
End of Act Three Act Four
I 'd be a right scoundrel if I didn 't lay a rose on my little Lulu 's bridal bed
Father , I 'm going away tonight ...
for a long time
He 's my Father !
If only you 'd come with me
I can 't live without you any longer
You 'll miss your train
Take it
Kill yourself !
Kill yourself , so you don 't make me a murderer as well !
End of Act Four Act Five Your Honours .
I have painted a picture of a tragic life
Members of the Jury . Look at this woman
Have I not shown that this woman did not commit murder ?
Her husband was the victim of tragic circumstances
Did not the son of the deceased speak in her defence ?
No , this unfortunate is not a murderess .
You must acquit her , she is innocent
Your Honours .
Members of the Jury The Greek gods created a woman :
Pandora . She was beautiful , charming , versed in the art of flattery
But the gods also gave her a box containing the evils of the world The headless woman opened the box and the evils were loosed upon us
Counsel for the Defence portrays the accused as a persecuted innocent I call her Pandora , because she brought evil upon Dr. Schön
The arguments of the Defence do not sway me .
I demand the death penalty
Prosecutor ! Do you know what would have become of your wife if she had spent her nights as a child drifting around cafés ?
... sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter with the four and a half months already served ...
Fire !
Fire !
End of Act Five Act Six
Passport . :
How dare you come here ?
Where else can I go but home ?
If you feel at home where my father bled to death ...
Is that the District Court ?
I want to speak to Prosecutor Von Bodungen
This is Alwa Schön .
Have you any news of the escapee ?
We 'll go away together .
Countess Geschwitz will lend me her passport
Passport . : Countess Augusta Geschwitz
I have the lady 's baggage
" 5,000 Marks Reward'
Received with thanks . Marquis Casti Piani
Marquis Casti Piani
May I prove my friendship by giving you good advice ?
Do not go to Paris , there are so many prying eyes .
Come with me . I know a place where people are hospitable ... and discreet
End of Act Six Act Seven
Lulu has been living here for three months
A fine hotel .
Hospitable and discreet
What 's wrong ?
It 's how we live
I 've just got engaged .
I 'm going to stage a fantastic variety act with my fiancée
But we need 20,000 francs to stage it
You must give me the money
Ask Alwa , perhaps he has won today
If I could carry on playing I 'd win it all back
That boy gets everything
You should only play when you 're sure of winning
How much ?
300 pounds
The German police would give me 250 pounds
300 , then .
I 'll go and book a cabin
He 's acting as if he wants to buy me
I need money urgently .
You can 't give me any .
The Egyptian will pay me 50 pounds more than the German police .
I 'm securing your future .
The police will never find you in his Cairo establishment
Get ready quickly .
You 're leaving in an hour
I won 't be sold .
That 's worse than prison
I need money .
If you aren 't ready in an hour I 'm calling the police
Alwa , you must win , you must .
Otherwwise I 'm lost
If I don 't have the 20,000 francs by tonight I 'll report you to the police
Money ... everyone wants money
Cry , my child , cry
Rodrigo will report me to the police .
I 'll show him !
I know how we can all get out of this mess
Countess Geschwitz fancies you and she has money
Be nice to her , then I 'm sure she 'll cough up
Only you can save me
Rodrigo is madly in love with you
Throw yourself at him , he 'll do anything for you .
Otherwise , he 'll report me
Calm down , you 'll soon have your money
Police !
Police !
Police !
Hurry !
I 'll find a boat !
We must find a ship to take us to London
End of Act Seven Act Eight
We only take in order to give .
Brother , how can I help you ?
No one can help me
It 's funny how you can get booze on credit , but not bread
Why put on the paint ?
We like you as you are
What a pity !
I wanted to eat Christmas pudding once more in my life
Warning to the Women of Londonl
For some time now a man has been trying to lure women and girls to dark places in order to murder them
Women and girls should not go out alone at night
I have no money
Come on , I like you
You 're under the mistletoe , you must let yourself be kissed

You 've got so many flacons , you are worse than my daughter .
Wait here until it stops raining .
Do you know what ?
Let it rain , you can spend the night in my house .
Hurry up , Andrea , I must go to work .
You know that I am afraid of strangers , Father .
Don 't be silly , this man is no thief !
Where would you go ?
There is no hotel in our village .
The storm must have cut off the wires .
I know you shall never come back ...
And ...
What 's the matter ?
Would you mind if I leave , Father ?
Do you want to visit your aunt ?
Very well then , go .
Why do people forget so quickly ?
Why do people forget so quickly ?
I yearn for you though I know you will never return .
I do not dare to die .
It would kill my father if I told him .
I am so helpless !
I cosset it inside of me , even if I feel that my life has reached its end .
I do not know why I write this letter , but I feel relief in knowing that you have not thought about me once .
My poor husband is waiting for me at the theatre .
What will you tell him about where you were ?
With my lover !
You would never say that !
Your key !
Who is that gentleman ?
Where does he live ?
Tell him to wait !
You can say whatever you wish !
I know you are lying !
I would not like to be in her shoes .
You 're impossible , you would even delude a saint !
Did your " little daughter " write ?
It is said he will soon be a grandfather !
They say she tied that man who spent the night at your house .
No one will dare touch the chastity of my daughter !
Your child was stillborn .
Perhaps it is better for you this way .
How some men handle their love affairs .
You see , you were here a few days longer and bed and board costs money .
Wandering aimlessly .
I am sending you some money , do not take everything so tragically .
But you wanted to go the other way .
The man who was to come for the blood transfusion is not here .
Maybe I ...
Do you know how you got injured ?
Your wife saved you your life .
My wife ?
Yes , your wife .
Don 't you remember ?
You brought her here in your car .
Could you bring my wife here then ?
I am sorry but I can deliver this piano model only in a few weeks as I have just sold the last one .
My wife .
I can wait a few weeks for the other piano .
Dangerous friendship .
You were not home , because you knew I would come .
He is a fine man .
I hope he will make a good impression on you .
... And in the evening In the morning In the morning I ask you to reject my husband 's invitation .
Forgive me , I should have done that myself .
... I know what pain I have caused you .
You may laugh at whatever I say to apologise to you .
Have you forgiven me ?
Yet in the evening ...
I love you and I am jealous of you because you love your husband .
Andrea , I want you to ...
Do not lie to me , he is the man who had your picture !
Who ?
That annoying man !
I do not know him at all !
I will keep an eye on that gentleman !
You must come with us tomorrow , we will be most pleased if you join us .
If you only knew what I think of him !
And what I think of you !
Not even an angel could put up with you !
I love you so much because you are not like other men , you are not jealous .
I am not jealous , because I trust you .
I have a terrible headache .
I am so tired .
... I almost forgot .
I will give you back your key , you will need it for someone else .
On the " trip " .
On the " trip " .
Don 't you think that leading a simple family life is most fortunate ?
Why don 't you get married then ?
It is quite simple and easy .
That is what you think !
... I think you will lose .
Do you want me to lose ?
We did not have time to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow .
It is my wife 's wish .
It is so nice in the south at this time of the year .
Yes , it is nice , indeed .
I hope to see you soon again !
What kind of a comedy is this !
Why aren 't you sincere , Andrea ?
I was never more sincere as today !
I think our trip will do you good , you will calm down .
I am calm , but you are jealous , and you are running away like a coward !
How " love " ends ...
Give this letter to my husband at 5 o 'clock .
Very well !
This is the end then !
You shall never see me again !
Was anyone here ?
Will you believe me if I say that no one ?
To loyalty - to all women !
I swear your wife is not in the room !
Liar !
The past that shall always be the past .
Shall we go ?
Yes , let us go !

Hypothetical Account of the Gold Content In the Mountains of the Moon
I maintain , after many years of comparative analyses , that primitive moon-rock contains more gold than the earth 's mountains .
One day , the first spaceship will fly to the moon , to bring its gold back to the earth !
Laughter , gentlemen , is the argument of idiots against every new idea - !
The progress of the world will not fail due to learned ignoramuses lacking in fantasy whose brains work in inverse proportion to their calcification - !
Professor - I 've decided to go ...
But not without me , Helius - not without me - !
Now your idea will triumph after all , Professor ...
Naturally Windegger will go along ?
What - ?
Windegger won 't - ?
Your collaborator and best friend ?
Friede Velten , student of astronomy , and Hans Windegger , Chief Engineer of Helius Hangars are engaged .
Dear Friede !
Best wishes to you and Hans !
Don 't be upset that I can 't come tonight to your engagement party !
Please accept the flowers as a substitute .
Yours , Wolf Helius .
He doesn 't even know anything about my decision - no-one does - except for you ...
I tell you , Helius , more people than you and I know of your plan -
- and the fellow whom I threw down the stairs before is one of them - !
Three nights ago -
So you think someone knows of my plans and is thus also interested in your moon-gold theory ?
Helius , don 't be angry - it 's my life 's work - go home -
I can 't rest until I know the manuscript is in your safe !
Dear Helius !
I write to you in incomparable bliss and you should be the first to know that Friede has agreed to be my wife .
Perhaps I took her a bit by surprise , but she said yes !
Come tonight to the engagement party at Friede 's apartment !
I am ridiculously happy !
Windegger
Fresh violets , sir ?
Wolf Helius , Bergstr . 86-3 To be delivered in person
Mr. Helius isn 't home ...
Please ... let me wait for Mr. Helius anyway .
Mr. Windegger sent me ...
To be delivered In person
Dear Helius !
Accept this poor soul , if you can , and give him work and a chance to make a life - he won 't disappoint you .
Warmest regards , Windegger
Drive to the nearest police station - don 't hold things up with long explanations - just bring some sort of officer here to me !
God in Heaven :
You must have some idea when you last phoned - !
Did you leave the flat unattended - ?
Only for a moment , when Gustav came to get me ... but then there was that man whom Mr. Windegger had sent - !
Would you allow me to use your telephone ?
My phone isn 't working ...
Christ , madame - someone has to pick up - there 's at least half a dozen people sitting around that phone - !
I 'm only the foreman of Helius Hangars - but if you keep working like this , you , Miss Friede , will soon be the forewoman of us all !
I was supposed to have sent you somebody with a letter of recommendation - ? !
I 'm begging you , Hans , get over here ...
I can 't tell you over the telephone what this is all about ... just , please , come ...
You can be assured , Hans , that I would not call you away from your engagement party if it weren 't absolutely necessary ...
We 'll be there right away , Helius !
Allow me to introduce myself - :
Turner ...
If you go flying down those steps again , Mr. Turner ,
I won 't be standing at the bottom to catch you ...
Believe me , Mr. Helius , there 's no wiser way to pass the time till the arrival of Ms. Velten and Mr. Windegger than to have a chat with me ...
First , a small request ... tell your chauffeur it 's no longer necessary to inform the police ...
The police have already been informed , Mr. Turner ...
Just a measure of caution , Mr. Helius , - as well as this ...
Also a measure of caution , Mr. Turner ?
I now grasp the phenomenon , Mr. Turner , how you haven 't been whiling away in prison all this time - !
You do flatter , Mr. Helius !
Perhaps you can also reveal to me , Mr. Turner , where the stolen manuscript - and the contents missing from my safe are located - ? !
Five of the wealthiest and cleverest minds who wish to keep the earth 's gold-reserve under their control -
One of the most interesting documents , madame and sirs ...
To prove the accessibility of the moon ,
Helius sent the unmanned trial-rocket H. 23 filled with magnesium , moonward - the explosion of which , upon impact , was viewed and photographed from the earth !
Thanks to the competence of our representative
I can show you something completely different - things that Helius himself has thus far not made available to the scientific community .
Cinematographic images of the surface of the moon by H. 32 during its first orbit of the moon . The unmanned register-rocket H.32, equipped with automatic imaging-instruments .
The rocket-jet .
In its nose-cone is located the egg-shaped register-chamber with the automated imaging-instruments .
The imaging-instrument , linked to a clockwork .
The mirror tele-objective .
Schematic depiction of the H.32 's trajectory .
Gravitational Field of the Moon
Zero-G Zone
Trajectory of H.32
Necessary starting speed 11,200 metres per second
First image of the moon , 36 hours after liftoff :
Distance of the rocket from the moon : Approx . 40,000 km .
At an altitude of approx . 1000 km H.32 flies over the moon-crater Eratosthenes -
- in its depths the astronomer W. H. Pickering , director of Mandeville Observatory , Jamaica , believes to have observed swarms of insects .
The objective 's eye sees what no man 's eye has ever seen :
The opposite side of the moon turned away from the earth .
Cryptic , monochrome planes of colossal dimensions -
Vegetation ?
Fog ?
Water ? -
- all seem to confirm the theory of Prof. Peter Andreas Hansen
- of the Seeberg Observatory near Gotha - that on the opposite side of the moon exists an atmosphere and , therefore , life .
Why lose more time ?
I for one want the moon 's riches of gold , should they actually prove to exist , to fall into the hands of businessmen and not visionaries and idealists !
At this moment our representative is making
Mr. Helius aware of our intentions in a very concrete manner ...
You have only two choices , Mr. Helius :
Either make the trip to the moon in our employ -
- or not at all ...
If we don 't come to an agreement , Mr. Helius , five minutes after my departure , your hangar , along with the nearly completed spaceship , will be reduced to a heap of rubble ...
What would you gain , by killing me off , Mr. Helius ?
- at the most , a travel companion who is less considerate !
You still don 't get the picture , Mr. Helius ... we 'd rather annihilate all of your plans than let you shut us out of the operation ...
Tell your clients , Mr. Turner , that I do not aim to found upon the moon a criminal-colony ...
Give me 24 hours to think it over ...
Will your ... plans be seriously affected by the theft , Helius ?
Don 't worry about the plans - !
I have duplicates of everything , safe in my desk 's secret compartment !
Hans dear , if I were you , I wouldn 't be so sure about that !
Why did you conceal from us , Helius , the fact that you now actually want to take on the voyage to the moon ?
You 've called me your good comrade so often at work - in the laboratory - in this very room ... now you want to lie to me , Helius ?
I didn 't mean to lie to you , Friede -
I just wanted to spare Hans the conflict between his love for you and his sense of duty towards the work we 've been doing !
But do you really believe , Helius , that Hans would ever be capable of letting you down ? !
Oh no , Helius ! You won 't make the trip to the moon without Windegger ...
- and not without me - !
Have you forgotten , Friede , how those fared that dared this trip to the moon before us -
IN MEMORY OF ... TO THE BOLD PIONEERS OF SPACE NAVIGATION
WHO DID NOT RETURN FROM THEIR JOURNEY INTO OUTER-SPACE
Friede - don 't you get it ? !
I just couldn 't stand to know you were in danger - God in heaven - and what danger indeed - !
He 's decided to travel to the moon , Hans ...
So when do we start - ?
And who will go with us ?
Ask Friede ...
Friede ... you want to go with me - ?
... in exactly 24 hours ...
Mr. Helius , the 24 hours for consideration were up 61 minutes ago ...
The explosion is of no concern , Mr. Helius - it 's nothing but a small accentuation of my offers ...
The price of this first warning , Mr. Windegger , is the hangar :
Just a shack ... the second one will cost the lives of men ... the third , the spaceship ...
Don 't force me , Mr. Helius , to take stronger measures :
Choose the lesser of two evils - : Me !
I give you my word , Mr. Helius , the very hour that we come to an agreement , you 'll get your stolen material back , complete and in perfect condition the Spaceship " FRIEDE " ( " Peace " ) is ready for launch ...
... at moonrise the spaceship will soar into outer-space only to land - if God sees fit - 36 hours later upon the opposite side of the moon at this moment bells will ring - the sirens of all the factories , trains and ships
In this final hour I must once again warn all of you ...
You , Manfeldt , and you - Mr. Turner :
I 'm leaving out Windegger :
And as for you ... Friede - !
Friede ... in this last minute ... - I 'm begging you -
Don 't beg me , Helius !
Helius , in this last instant , do you want to shame me as a woman ?
... the whole world 's eyes are directed upon us ... - ... the whole world 's ears are listening to us ...
Everyone to their stations ... We launch in 50 minutes - !
... the whole world 's eyes are directed upon us ... - ... the whole world 's ears are listening to us ...
Just now Just now the Just now the spaceship
Just now the spaceship has reached the launch pad because the spaceship is built too light to stand freely , it 's submerged in a water-basin in which it floats upright ...
From the moment of launch till attaining the necessary speed of 11,200 km per second ...
... there will be 8 critical minutes in the battle with the increase in speed , with G-force , which has a fatal effect upon human organisms when it goes over 40 metres per second ...
... after these 8 minutes , during which we 'll feel an intolerable burden pulling our bodies back to earth , we 'll be victors in the battle with gravitational force ... or -
... and if we aren 't able to maintain our speed of 11200 ... then we 'll hurtle - and hurtle - further - and further still -
- irretrievably lost in outer-space - never again ... never again ...
I 'll be the one to pull the stop-lever , Windegger !
60 seconds to go - ! 20 seconds to go - lie still - take a deep breath - !
10 seconds to go - !
NOW
Launch-rocket depleted !
Full-throttle on middle-rocket !
Win-degger ... jet-tison ... middle ... - ro-cket ...
Turn ... back !
Maybe this chap is dead ? !
I think Josephine needs a brandy !
I think Mr. Turner needs one even more - !
Don 't you see , someone is stowed away in the cargo hold !
Okay , you wretched scoundrel , how did you get in here ? !
I 've devoted my whole life to moon-issues , Mr. Helius !
Moon Vampire
The Mystery of the Deadly Moon-Rays
The earth ... where is our earth - ! ?
The sun is rising on our earth ...
Logbook of the Spaceship FRIEDE
Turning the spaceship 's black side toward the sun ... to absorb warmth . -
All 's well on board .
227,000 km from earth . Stopping the last jets , flying without propulsion . Weightlessness on board .
Have entered the moon 's gravitational field . - Are within 9000 km of the moon .
Through the directional boosts mentioned above weight regained on board .
Turning the spaceship with the jets in direction of destination to fire brake boosts to prevent premature crash on the moon . -
Are about to reach the side of the moon facing away from earth .
We 're seeing it again , Hans ... we 're seeing it again !
And when are we finally going to land ? !
If we had a spark of reason in us , we wouldn 't ever land - !
You 're just afraid - you wimp - !
Tell him he has no right to jeopardise all our lives for the sake of his ambition !
By God now is not the time for arguments , Hans -
Shut the window-hatches - !
Full brake-power - we 're plummeting - !
Hold on tight - !
The ignition cable probably isn 't going to fix itself !
The moon awaits !
First though we have to do an air-sample , to tell whether we can breathe outside !
Do what you want !
I 'm only interested in how I 'll get back out of here !
I 'll tell you just one thing , Friede , as soon as I have the spaceship ready to launch again , I 'll fly back to earth - and neither Helius nor Manfeldt will stop me - !
Do you really aim to stab Helius in the back ?
Do you really aim to stab me in the back ?
Now Helius has no choice but to prepare right away for the trip back - !
But Helius is convinced that we 'll find water with the divining rod !
You know what the only thing is that we 'll find on the moon - !
- Death !
Professor , please , help me with the air-sample !
For God 's sake , don 't open it - !
If he opens the outer door and outside there 's no breathable atmosphere , then we 're done for good !
He 's taken the divining rod with him !
It 's as if the rod is pulling him forward !
Mingo would follow this trail , Mr. Helius !
The main objective should be to look for water !
I have enough to do , to get us ready to launch again !
May I volunteer to look for Professor Manfeldt and , at the same time , water ?
Atmosfere breathable , not yet analised .
Törner on the trale for 3 hours of Manfeldt searching for water .
Since when is Gustav your secretary ?
I can 't stand it anymore ... I 'm going to look for Manfeldt - !
From Miss Friede ... so you won 't go hungry !
Professor - !
Professor - ! Professor - !
Don 't let him into the ship ! Don 't let him into the ship !
Is there anyone in the world to whom we should relay your last regards - if we get back to earth ?
The oxygen containers - the shot hit the oxygen containers - !
What does this mean , Miss Friede , with the oxygen containers ? !
Let 's pray to God it means nothing !
We 've lost more than half of the oxygen !
That means : One of us can 't go back to earth - !
One of us has to stay on the moon - !
Yes , Windegger : One of us !
Do you know what this means - do you ? !
To stay here - alone on the moon - just because you didn 't want to listen to me - you and him !
Short one loses - long one wins ... and we draw three times ...
You draw - !
So draw then - !
Would it be easier for you , Hans , if I stayed with you on the moon ?
I have only one desire : To get back to earth - !
Let 's drink to a happy homecoming to earth - for all of us to a happy homecoming - for all of us , Hans !
The base-camp is ready , Mr. Helius !
Now you must prove , Gustav , that I can rely upon you !
I 'm staying back here on the moon ...
- and you will guide the spaceship away from the moon !
Do you want Mr. Windegger to perish - ?
And Miss Friede , who loves him - ?
The enormous shock of the launch will naturally wake the sleepers - and then Mr. Windegger will take over the command ...
I am convinced that you won 't let me down just as I haven 't let you down .
I shall wait calmly and with confidence that you 'll come to get me .
Farewell !

The family has decided -
Ww .
Bolke :
Dear Father ,
Dear Osdorff , I am so unhappy .
Your nephew still doesn 't want to obey , Herr Count .
I 've tried everything with you , every school and every trade :
you 've failed at all of them !
Now I 've had enough !
See how far you get on your own .
In the reformatory one lived according to the house-rules .
And so the housekeeper became the lady of the house .
Thymian 's Room
NURSERY
Count Osdorff resolved to help Thymian .
Dear Osdorff : I am so unhappy .
What did I actually do that I am treated so strictly and cruelly ?
... because Meta has father wrapped around her finger . I beg you to go to him .
Perhaps then I 'll be able to go home again . Yours , Thymian
I 'm afraid to write to Father :
Meta is so mean ... -
I heard that your uncle has thrown you out -
- go now to Thymian . You belong together :
the outcast and the lost-girl .
Go to her - Tell her something nice - !
Here the pharmacy won 't be auctioned off to you just yet .

Even the strictest discipline cannot repress the girls ' desire to look pretty .
PUNISH ERIKA

The Count claims to come on behalf of your father .
No-one at home wants to know anything more about you :
Meta has married your father .
Steal the key , and I 'll help you further .
I 'll wait for you tonight in front of your house !
I know where we can stay .
I want to go to my child .
I 'll write down for you where l can be found .
I 'd like to see my child , Little Erika Henning -
She happens to be dead -
He just took her away .
Where you headed , luv ?

Erika and Count Osdorff are received with open arms by the proprietress of the establishment .
And what 's more , he leaves his regards !
Oh , be reasonable , little one :
you don 't even have a shirt on your back !
If your friend helps you , you 'll be outta this whole mess !
Me ?
! I 'm penniless , and my uncle won 't give me anything more !
I want to go to work !
What are you able to do , my poor little thing ?

Dance Lessons by the beautiful Thymian Henning
Little child , how did you end up here ... ?
... I tell you , you 'll bitterly regret this !
That 's Dr. Vitalis - he always wants to save us but in the end he joins us .
You look like you 're at a funeral , dear friend : try and be a li 'l happy !
Today 's your birthday ?
I know how I 'll help :
Once a year the pharmacist takes his wife out on the town .
So here you have the seamy side of the big city .
And what can you win with the lot ?
Yes , Thymian , now you are a lost-girl - - just as we 're all lost !
Three years have passed since the painful meeting between father and daughter .
After a brief , trying illness , my beloved husband , the pharmacist Karl Friedrich Henning
passed away yesterday , on the 17th of June , 1929 .
INHERITANCE NOTICES Thymian Henning , as legal heir to Herr Henning 's estate , is requested to attend the reading of the will , which will take place in the house of the deceased .
Money will enter the house - over a short course - by way of a dark lady !
Why , you 're rich !
Yes , I could start another life -
For another life - you need a new identity !
He should marry her !
Countess Thymian Osdorff :
You insist on exercising your right to take over the pharmacy ... . ... and drive your friend 's poor widow out of her home ?
Countess , Herr Meinert has redeemed the mortgage of 45.000 marks that you inherited from your mother ... and thus becomes the sole owner of the pharmacy .
Filthy slut !
The money !
Where 's all the money ?
- l gave it to my little sister , so she doesn 't end up like me .
And me ?
Am I to blame in the end ?
I , his uncle , bear most of the blame .
I should never have repudiated that helpless lad !
May I attempt to repay you with the debt I owe him ?
We 're now in Swinemünde .
Uncle Osdorff is so kind to me .
My former life often seems like an ugly , terrible dream .
Cousin Osdorff - !
My niece - Countess Osdorff :
Little Thymian , you don 't recognize me any more ?
Dear Countess , I hope you 'll let me take care of you .
I 'd like - for us to leave !
We beg you , dear Countess , to work with us in our society for saving wayward young girls .
Countess Thymian Osdorff is invited to the board meeting and to examine our institution on 19 August 1929 .
Our youngest member - Countess Osdorff .
Today we have an especially difficult case .
A young girl has once again been entrusted to us ... . ... who has struck down our every educational measure by repeatedly running away .
How we 've worried about her -
Fabulous !
My dear , try the soup they make here !
Yet she constantly turns away from the blessings of our home -
I know this house and its " blessings " -
Your ignorance won 't help her - l want to try , for l was once what she is .
A little more love and no-one would be lost in this world !

Once upon a time ...
Eight years later .
Around three o 'clock in the morning ... .
Sixteen years before .
In the spring ... ..
Be careful , Sterling don 't let those Javanese sell you any jungles for tea plantations .
Phyllis , will you tell Mother !
Tell Mother !
I 'll write !
Isn 't this romantic ?
It 's going to be our second honeymoon !
Come and have a last look at San Francisco .
I live in the center of the largest tea district in Java .
Since you are dealing in tea , Mr. Sterling , why not make my home your headquarters ?
Any big game in Java ?
I 've always had a secret ambition to shoot a tiger .
If you will honor my house with a visit , I shall be happy to arrange a tiger hunt .
That would be great .
I 'll tell Mrs. Sterling .
Oh , you are married ?
I 'd like you to meet my wife .
Dear , I want you to meet Prince de Gace .
I 'm sorry , but this is very important .
I 'll be right back .
Will you have some thing to drink ?
I never drink .
Will you dance ?
I never dance .
Don 't you like dancing ?
My wife loves to dance , too .
Your country has always interested me , with its worship of the great God business .
The East is a country of the senses warm , mysterious , like the kiss of a lover .
You are like the orchids of your country , you have the same cold enchantment .
In Java the orchids grow wild and their perfume fills the air .
And the women of Java do they grow wild , too ?
Not wild , but natural .
They do not pretend to be cold
The heat , the everlasting heat strips everyone of all pretense .
It would be fascinating to learn whether your coldness is only a pretense .
I am furious !
The steward just told me my hunting outfit is not on board !
Don 't worry , Mr. Sterling .
I can supply you with hunting equipment .
I am afraid of your Prince
This gun business gets my goat !
John , didn 't you notice anything strange in the Prince 's attitude toward me ?
There 's something strange about all foreigners !
He said . I was like an orchid ...
He said : Java strips women of all pretense
And then , he took me in his arms and kissed me .
I had a terrible nightmare !
- JAVA- A land of magic beauty , cursed with heat relentless heat
But you were just saying you wanted a nice , cold drink !
I won 't accept anything from him ! "
He 's a fine chap , what 's the matter with him ?
I just don 't like him !
And I begged you not to accept his invitation !
Don 't be unreasonable , Lillie !
Why don 't you like him ? "
You know I 've always wanted to shoot a tiger . "
It 's the heat .
It 's just the heat , dear .
He says your beauty is more dazzling than the sun .
Reminds me of the Army !
Your room .
Your personal maids !
A little arrangement for lowering the temperature
Good Lord , a double-bed !
Now , Mr. Sterling i will show you your room .
Your personal maids .
Pardon , Madame .
Dinner is at eight . "
What a fascinating costume !
I trust Madame has enjoyed the evening .
What in Heaven 's name have you got on ?
You look silly , dear take off that junk and go to bed .
Great eastern company about to bid tea propertiers you are interested
I advise close deals immediately
I 've got to cover six plantations it 's no trip for you !
Why can 't you stay here , like a sensible woman ?
Because I want to be with you .
The Prince is going with us .
I think Mrs. Sterling would enjoy it more if the top were down .
You would have the top down !
Now I suppose you 'll catch cold !
Top up now , sir .
We 'll have to wait for Mrs. Sterling .
You can 't travel in that condition .
You 'll have to stay here and we 'll come back for you .
But , dear , I don 't want to stay here alone .
I just told him if anything happened to Mrs. Sterling , I would cut his throat .
Your husband thought you would be safer if I remained with you .
Why have you shut yourself away from me all day ?
You were afraid afraid of yourself !
You wanted to come out hours ago
Where is Mrs. Sterling ?
Mrs. Sterling went to her room after supper .
I thought you were never coming back !
Why are you so excited ?
I was so worried about you .
Have you lost anything ?
I just wanted to say good-night .
Then there is nothing to keep us in Java any longer , is there ?
I don 't want to leave Java until I 've killed my tiger .
The jungle ...
My pipe .
I must have left it in my hunting coat .
Did you find it ?
I have a head-ache I think I 'll go to bed .
Did you hear that ?
Did you ever try to get one at night ? "
It 's exciting enough by daylight , on the back of an elephant .
I am afraid , he knows ...
Don 't be afraid .
I 'll see that he knows nothing !
The tiger must be very near camp .
I just heard him again .
Let 's try to get a shot at him .
This is ridiculous !
I 'm going back !
It 's empty !
You ...
What right had you to do this ?
What right had you to take it for granted I loved him , was faithless to you ?
You are blind blind , blind !
The doctor says he 'll be all right in a few days .
I hope you 'll forgive me , but you see I loved you , too .
John , you blind , foolish . Darling , will you never understand you are the only man I love ?
Is this a carjacking ?
- Are you carjacking me ?
- I 'm the devil .
Before you were born , your mom and I sold your soul to the devil .
- You gonna tell Andi ?
- I 'm not gonna tell Andi !
If she knows , she 'll never go out with me .
You could make her go out with you , Damien .
You 're just gonna bring escaped souls back to hell .
That 's cool , right ?
- How am I supposed to capture ' em ?
- This will help ... a vessel , hand-crafted in the bowels of perdition by the iniquitous and the vile .
- That 'll work .
- A word of caution ...
I don 't accept failure .
You finally found the one thing that you 're good at .
You sent an escaped soul back to hell .
- Come on , come on .
- All right !
Those are huge on you .
- All right , feel that ?
- Nope , not a thing .
This is gonna work great .
- All right !
Now run , rabbit .
- All right , wait , give me a head start .
Steady ...
Oh , Sock !
- Below the waist !
- What did you say ?
Say ... let 's try again .
Here , here .
This 2 pants thing doesn 't work !
You sure about that ?
Let 's try again here .
Sock , you 're makin 'me mad !
Wait , wait .
Oh , my god , mom !
- You 're back !
- Hi , sweetheart !
Oh , ribs , sweetie !
Ribs , ribs .
Oh , sorry .
How was Vegas ?
Mom , did you see me shoot Ben in the butt ?
I did .
Good shootin ' , Bert .
- Very good shot .
- Hey , Ms. Wysocki .
Um , mom ... Who 's the , uh , cowboy ?
Um , Bert , there 's something I have to tell you .
Uh , this is Morris .
And we have some wonderful news .
Will you stop checking the time ?
Am I that boring ?
No , I told you I have to leave in 10 minutes .
I 'm gonna be super late .
And it 's definitely not boring .
I 'll tell you when 10 minutes is up .
What ...
Hey , what ?
Oh , my gosh , this is beautiful !
You were gonna give it to me as a present ?
That is so sweet !
Yeah .
Yeah , you ... you like it ?
I love it .
It 's perfect .
Put it on .
There you go .
Oh !
Thank you , thank you , thank you !
- What 's up ?
- Sock , what are you doing ?
I need you to get rid of this , OK ?
Sock , are you all right ?
My mom came home from Vegas today .
You shot your mom with a BB gun ?
No , Sam , of course not .
I might have shot an Asian cowboy , though .
What ?
Yeah .
And I think I punched him in the eye .
I don 't know .
It 's all a big blur .
- Will you rub my head ?
- Yeah .
Thank you .
That feels good .
Sock , what the hell is going on ?
My mom get married .
And now I have nobody , except for you two .
Would somebody get me a six pack ?
It 's what my mom would have done .
Oh , hey , you 're up .
Sock , why is my alarm clock going off at 4 : 30 in the morning ?
Yeah , I couldn 't sleep , either .
But , um , since we 're both awake , do you want to talk ?
Do we have to do this now ?
Can you believe she married a guy named Morris ?
Morris , Sam .
I mean , I don 't even think he 's a real cowboy .
You know , I mean , how long has she even known this guy , a week ?
Now she 's going to shack up with a total stranger .
Yeah , good idea , mom .
She 's absolutely going to regret this .
Oh , blue tie .
Definitely better than the red .
Sometimes , if you love somebody enough , you have got to let them hit rock bottom .
Even though I might want to kick Morris ' ass to the curb right now ,
I 'm not gonna do it .
I 'm gonna stand strong , and I 'm gonna be firm .
Hello ?
You know , my mom and I are a team , and teammates do not go out and get married behind each other 's backs .
That 's one thing I know .
So I 'm gonna take the one thing away from her she loves the most ... me .
I 'm not gonna move back in until she admits she made a mistake .
I can 't do it .
I can 't work .
I 'm too upset .
Sock , come on , it 'll be good for you .
It 'll take your mind off of things .
OK , but I need a push .
Sam , I am a wall of misery , all right ?
You 're gonna have to do a little better than that .
Let 's go .
Sock ?
!
Oh , my god , Sock , are you OK ?
Hey , did you just fly in here ?
Sam moved me with his mind .
The devil must be screwing with me .
What do you think it means ?
It might have something to do with the soul .
That ... was wicked .
Let 's do it again .
Ben , help me with the tree .
Sam , get back over there .
Hey , do you know where Sock is ?
I need him to fake a seizure for me .
That is an unusual request .
Yeah , well , Ted saw Sock fall into the Christmas tree .
He 's terrified of a workman 's comp lawsuit .
Terrified Ted is always a good time .
- Sock 's in house wares .
- Great , thank you .
There 's something about the sea air .
- You know ?
- Yeah .
Maybe it 's because all of life came from the sea .
It 's primordial .
Clean , fresh .
And almost entirely covers up the stench of that decomposing corpse down there .
- Who is that ?
- A vagrant , I think .
No one of consequence .
Where 's its head ?
Removed , and partially eaten by one Phillip Carmona .
Hell 's latest overachiever .
- Eaten ?
- Yeah .
In life , Carmona was a cannibal .
Had a predilection for eating the brains and the heart .
- So the soul ate its heart , too ?
- No , I don 't think so .
He got scared away .
Look , he always finishes his meals and he always eats at night .
Now you just follow the corpse , you 'll find your soul .
Excuse me a moment .
What 's up ?
You 're gonna be sorry when I 'm famous , Rachel .
Rachel , how can you date an accountant ?
- Great titles , man .
- Thanks .
They 're about my ex .
Her name was Rachel .
Really ?
Not a nice girl , I take it .
She left me for following my dream , the dream of rock and roll .
You 're probably drinking a lot more than usual .
You gotta numb the pain , bro .
Jerry Belvedere .
AR for popblast records .
Ryan Milner .
My stage name 's Ryan .
- No last name .
- Ryan .
You know , Ryan , I bet you and I can make a deal that 'll be extremely beneficial to the both of us .
Mr. Belvedere , can I talk to you for a second ?
What are you doing ?
What does it look like ?
You 're setting that guy up so you can buy his soul .
Duh , Sam .
Come on , just leave him alone .
He 's pathetic enough as it is !
Oh , wow , Sammy , maybe you 're right .
If I 'm hearing you correctly , you 're basically calling me a morally bankrupt , evil being .
Yes , more or less .
Then this makes perfect sense .
Hey , uh , I gotta get going .
Wait , wait , wait , is that her ?
Cady ?
Yeah , yeah , she 's just ...
We 're gonna hang out .
Oh , OK , well , bring her over here .
What 's the big deal ?
I mean , we 're friends , right ?
So , why can 't I meet your girlfriend ?
I mean , unless you 're trying to hide her from me .
- Why would I do that ?
- Too late .
- Hi , cutie !
- Hey .
- Hi , I 'm Cady .
- Hi .
Uh , Andi .
I 've heard a lot about you .
- Yeah , all good things .
- Oh , good to hear .
That 's a nice necklace .
Oh , thank you .
Sam got it for me .
Yeah , actually , he showed it to me ... once .
Andi used to play soccer in high school , like you .
- You guys ... did that ...
- Well , enjoy your lunch .
And your necklace .
She hates me .
- No , she doesn 't hate you .
- Come on , Sam , it 's obvious .
Did you guys have a thing ?
Yeah ... Let 's sit down .
All right , this ... this is my fault .
All right , the necklace you 're wearing was actually one I had originally bought for her .
When ?
- Uh , a few weeks ago ?
- And then you gave it to me ?
Yeah , but to be fair , I didn 't plan on giving it to you .
I ... I just , I got caught when you found it and I made a rash decision .
I ...
So why did you keep it ?
I ... I don 't have an answer .
That 's weird , Sam .
- Cady ...
- Don 't follow me .
Next time I buy a present for a girl ...
I need you to punch me in the junk .
- That 's the only way I punch .
- Not now , Sock !
- What 's the problem ?
- Cady 's mad at me ,
Andi 's all pissed off .
I don 't ...
Will you listen to this guy ?
Oh , wah , I have 2 chicks fighting over me !
What am I gonna do ?
Why am I so loveable ?
Shut up .
Enjoy it , Sam .
Or at least , you know , try and flip it into a three-way .
- That 's what I 'd do .
- Hey , this guy Ryan 's pretty lame .
This CD is for all the dreamers who dream of the rock and roll dream , so dream on .
I gotta ...
I gotta side with the devil on this one .
- Some people just belong in hell .
- No , I feel bad for him .
The devil 's gonna sucker him into a deal and he 'll be just as screwed as I am .
What can you do ?
I mean , if the guy wants to sell his soul to the devil ,
- it 's not your problem .
- But I could at least warn him .
If somebody had stepped in before my parents sold my soul ...
Whatever .
Devil says something about the soul eating after dark .
- Don 't we have to get to the morgue ?
- No , we have time .
We can stop
- at the marina along the way .
- Then can we swing by my mom 's house , too ?
I kinda want to egg her bedroom window .
Well , this is where he was .
Maybe he 's playing in another spot .
Yeah , but know where ?
I mean , we can 't look on every corner ...
I think I know where he might be .
Looks like the devil got to him first .
Pike Arena ?
That 's huge .
Damn it .
Devil said follow the body .
Carmona only feeds at night .
Pretty good , right ?
- Look it .
- Jose Miller .
Not bad , yeah .
How 'd you get Josie to give you her ID badge ?
It 's part of some memory trinkets I stole from her .
She took so much and gave back so little .
So Jose Miller it is .
Well , as long as that thing gets us into the morgue ,
- where the body is , who cares ?
- It 's almost 6 : 00 .
We need to be ready when the soul comes back to feed .
Let 's see what we 're saddled with this time .
Nice .
A spear gun .
Very James Bond .
You say this job isn 't cool .
Evening , lieu-tective .
Just gotta get these experts in for a dental match on a certain Jonathan Deere .
All right ?
So he always finishes his meal ?
Yeah , we gotta find the headless body .
Which one do you think it is ?
It 's gonna be this one .
Yeah , well , Carmona didn 't come back for seconds .
Excuse me .
What are you doing here ?
Oh , uh , we 're from , uh , downtown .
Downtown branch , and we 're actually taking over the case .
It 's a jurisdictional thing .
- Juris ... jurisdictional .
- What case are you talking about ?
Actually , that is a need to know .
We wish we could do something about it , but we can 't .
It 's just ... whoa .
This ID is expired .
And the picture is pasted on .
What ...
- OK , but could I possibly have the ID back ?
- Get out of here .
- I 'm calling the police .
- No , I ... keep it !
I thought you said that jurisdiction thing always works .
Why do you always have to point out my flaws , Ben ?
So what do we do now ?
We 'll just stop the soul before he ever gets to the body .
There 's only 2 ways in .
Let 's seal up the doors so we know which way Carmona 's coming .
OK , good one .
All right , come on , Carmona .
Whoa , sorry . Oh !
It 's my mom .
Hurts , doesn 't it ?
All right , be cool . All right , be cool .
You guys , look .
Look , it 's him , it 's the soul .
It 's him .
Go , go , go !
On three !
1 , 2 , 3 !
Where is he ?
Where is he ?
Oh , damn it !
It 's locked , it 's locked .
Go , go , go .
Boy , you spook easily . Huh .
- It 's just rubber .
- So it was you , right ?
Use your words , Sammy .
What was me ?
This .
- You got Ryan a concert .
- Oh , wow , this came out pretty sharp .
Yeah .
The umlaut was my idea .
- You made him sell you his soul ?
- Not yet , but I will .
It 's a classic " first taste is free " gambit .
Ryan gets his gig , tastes a little fame , and then while he 's on that endorphin high ,
I slap that contract right in front of him .
- Never fails .
- That really works ?
We 're talkin 'about rock and roll , man .
The devil 's music . Comin 'down the crossroads .
Sell your soul for rock and roll , baby .
It 's not funny .
He 's gonna spend eternity in hell !
Oh , you 're right , you 're right .
It 's never a laughing matter , Sammy .
But , hey , let 's talk about you .
What 's up with that cannibal of yours ?
Why haven 't you caught him ?
- I don 't know where he is .
- Talk to the mother .
- Carmona has a mom ?
- Yep .
And you know moms .
- They love talkin 'about their kids .
- Even when the kid 's a people eater ?
Well , it 's just more to talk about .
Hi , Mrs. Carmona .
We were wondering if we could talk to you about your son .
Wait , wait , wait , you don 't understand !
Why don 't you vultures leave me alone !
But we 're not vultures , Mrs. Carmona .
My son didn 't do any of the things they said .
- He was a good boy .
- Oh , I 'm sure he was .
He was our favorite camp counselor .
You knew him at Camp Soaring Arrow ?
Yes , we did know him at Camp Soaring Arrow .
The memories are flooding in .
You know , toasting marshmallows and panty raids and learning how to use your ...
- Archery .
- Bow and arrow .
You like my son ?
Yeah , we thought your son was great .
- Would you boys like some pie ?
- Sure .
Here 's the picture of Phillip in the school play one Thanksgiving .
He 's so cute .
- He 's the kid dressed in brown ?
- Oh , yes .
He played gravy .
Oh , here he is in the pee wee football .
And this is Phillip in his high school graduation .
Such a sweet boy .
- You and your son were close , huh ?
- He was my best friend .
That 's nice .
That 's how it 's supposed to be .
Yeah , it 's true .
Yep , you 're right .
So what was Phillip like away from camp ?
Where did he like to go ?
Was there any special place he liked to hang out ?
- Or hide out , maybe .
- Well , not really .
Mostly he liked to hang out with me .
Sometimes right after the sun goes down , I imagine I see him , out there at the end of the driveway , or over in the backyard .
The other night ,
I could have sworn I saw him sitting on the swing .
It seemed so real .
Bye bye , Mrs. C. Have a good day .
All right .
He just comes here to hang out with his mom .
Well , can you blame the guy ?
I mean , that ... that , my friends , is a real mom .
A beautiful , selfless , kind-hearted woman who built her entire life around her son .
Even though he was a crazy-assed convicted cannibal .
Gets me , right here .
Right ... right here .
Is it ... where 's your heart ?
On the left ?
OK , Ryan , sound check on mic .
- Tommy , how was that ?
- Great , Ryan , let 's take five .
All right .
Thank you , gorgeous .
- Hey , from the record company , right ?
- You 're friends with Jerry ?
Yeah , yeah , that ... that 's me .
- How ya doin ' ?
- Awesome .
Listen , Ryan , did you sign any contract or make any promises ...
I can 't believe it .
Tomorrow night , every seat 's gonna be filled .
Ryan !
Did you sign anything ?
What ... no , man .
I didn 't get any paperwork yet .
But don 't worry . When I do , I 'll sign it .
No questions .
No , no , I 'm trying to tell you to not sign a contract with ... with the record company .
- Dude , what are you talkin 'about ?
- This isn 't what you think it is .
Did Jerry mention anything about what you might sacrifice for this deal ?
But I 'll do anything .
Jerry is the devil , and he 's trying to get you to sell your soul , OK ?
Get out of here , man , are you crazy ?
How did you sell out this entire arena when nobody 's even heard you before ?
Maybe ...
- they like my songs .
- How did they even hear your songs ?
I mean , come on , doesn 't it bother you that this all happened so easily ?
He 's the devil , and if you go through with this , you 're gonna spend eternity in hell when you die .
- Who cares ?
- Who car ... are you insane ?
Hey , look .
Yesterday , I was nothing .
My wife left me .
My friends thought I was a failure .
But today , I 'm a rock star , man .
You got it ?
I 'm a rock star !
They were wrong .
They were all wrong .
I 'll worry about my soul when I 'm dead .
What do you want ?
I just wanted to see if this car had heated seats .
I always wanted to try heated seats .
- Please get out of my car .
- Fine , fine .
After the way you helped me out with Ryan , I owe you one , buddy .
How did I help you out ?
Well , you remember when I told you that that first time is for free gambit never fails ?
White lie .
Usually the sticking point is when I reveal that I 'm the devil .
You know , that freaks some people out .
But this time I mixed it up a little bit .
See , I had you deliver the news .
You 're utterly unthreatening .
When you say " devil " , it sounds sorta cute .
So now that he 's over the initial shock , I can step in and close the deal .
I just wanted to tell you that I appreciate it .
Just thanks again , buddy .
Hey , Josie .
You are coming with me .
Why were you at the coroner 's office ?
I got a call from my grandmother .
She thought my uncle Hector was hit by a car .
Turns out , he 's OK , the whole thing was a false alarm .
Write it down .
You guys just happened to go to the morgue the same night my old ID badge shows up .
Inexplicable , but true .
Why would I want to use your ID , Josie ?
I look nothing like you .
Where were you when you heard about your uncle ?
I was at Sock 's house playing nintendo .
- You sure about that ?
- Positive .
Nintendo at Sock 's .
Ben was racking up points .
He almost didn 't take the call about uncle Hector .
And you didn 't use my ID to get into the morgue ?
Why would I use your ID ?
I look nothing like you .
I ... sorry , I ...
Uncle Hector , Nintendo , I look nothing like you .
- Booya .
- " Booya . "
What does that mean ?
That means you 're not gonna fool us with any of your lawyer mumbo jumbo legalese .
What would I want to trick you about ?
What is it that you 're so excited to be throwin 'in my face ?
The truth .
I get very excited about confirming the truth .
It sets me free .
The truth that you three tell in exactly the same words ,
- exactly the same way .
- Yep .
Why ?
I 'll find out what you 're up to .
Then I 'll show you " Boo-yah . "
Oh , do it .
I dare ya , show me your booya !
- Hey , I wasn 't sure you 'd come .
- Yeah , me , either .
- Thanks for the flowers .
- Yeah , of course .
I don 't know what to say to you , Sam .
You don 't have to say anything .
I 'm a jerk .
You saw that necklace and I freaked out .
I 'm sorry .
I should have just told you the truth .
It wasn 't about the necklace , Sam .
What do you mean ?
Look , I can get over the fact that you bought a present for another girl .
It 's just ...
I don 't know that you can get over it .
Yeah , I can .
It just seems to me like maybe you still have feelings for Andi .
And if you do , just tell me .
Yeah , I 'm gonna be sad , but
I 'm not a consolation prize .
Cady ...
I don 't think that about you , all right ?
I 'm with you .
Not her , OK ?
- OK .
- OK ?
Oh , come on , man .
Just answer the phone .
It 's like 6 times she 's called already .
Seven .
Just talk to your mom !
What if she 's trying to apologize ?
She 's not calling to apologize , Sam .
All right , she 's calling to get me to accept her dumb decision about Morris .
And I don 't accept him .
I reject him .
Right , until she rejects him , too ,
- we got nothin 'to talk about .
- What if she never rejects him ?
I mean , have you thought about that ?
I mean , you might not have a choice here .
I do have a choice , Ben .
I have a very good choice .
- Sock , what are you doing ?
- Starving , Sam .
I 'm gonna go in there , I 'm gonna talk to Mrs. Carmona .
Sweet little Mrs. Carmona , see if she has any more pie .
What about the soul ?
The soul 's supposed to show up any minute now .
Hello ?
Mrs. Carmona .
Hi , it 's Sock .
Remember me ?
I was just , uh , driving by , and I thought I smelled some of that delicious pi ...
Pie ?
Oh , no .
Mrs. C ?
You ... sicko , sociopathic , bastard .
- How could you ?
- I was hungry .
All she had was pie .
She loved you ... through everything .
She supported you completely !
And you killed her because you didn 't want to eat delicious pie ? !
Come here !
No , no !
You could have eaten anyone !
She was loving , and sweet , and you chewed her up like she was nothing !
Nothing !
I 'll go get a table .
- I 'm sorry .
- I 'm sorry .
Listen , I should never have given anyone that necklace .
That was a mistake .
No , listen , I 'm the one that should be apologizing , OK ?
I was a jerk .
I deliberately provoked that fight , OK ?
I should have just ... kept my cool .
Good .
We both can admit we 're awful people .
I don 't think I 'm awful .
What was that ?
Nothing .
We just ... cleared up the whole necklace incident .
We 're all going to be friends , yay .
Do you want to be friends ?
'Cause that 's not what it sounds like .
You know what , you need to let that go .
He 's seeing somebody else .
I 'm not getting in the middle of that .
I wouldn 't let you get in the middle of it , Andi .
That just serves as further proof that we can 't trust a word out of Sam Oliver 's mouth .
Liars .
All three of ' em .
You 're just mad ' cause they outsmarted you .
They did not outsmart me . And I 'm not mad .
- I 'm furious .
- Yeah .
- Would you look at this ?
- Promotional coasters .
The devil 's really doin 'it up .
OK , guys , can we get a toast here ?
To Mrs. Carmona .
Loving mother who deserved much better than being eaten .
You 're right .
You 're right .
I gotta say , cannibal soul , scariest soul we 've ever captured . Hands down .
- Oh , really ?
- Yes .
Cannibal soul vs. fire soul , fire soul wins every time .
Well , maybe from a distance , yeah .
But , you know , get them in a cage match , cannibal soul gets in close , face is gone .
OK , cage match .
Cannibal soul vs. crazy dog monster soul .
That 's interesting , man .
I like that .
And cannibal soul wouldn 't eat the dog , 'cause it 's a dog , obviously ,
- and it 's not a man , so ...
- But , I don 't know , Benji .
If I got hungry enough , I would definitely eat a dog .
Would you eat a man ?
It depends on what man we 're talking about .
I mean , if we 're talking about George Clooney , then , yeah .
Because he 's gorgeous and I hate him .
So that proves my point right there . Scariest soul of all time ,
- cannibal soul .
- Yeah , I agree .
How bad do you think he 'd scare this guy ?
- Doh , Sam !
- Sorry .
- That hurts .
- Sorry .
Come on , come on , come on .
OK , OK , OK .
Safety meeting first .
Sam , make sure you release the soul from the vessel .
- Sock brings Ryan down here .
- Bet your ass I will .
I 'm gonna dangle this bacon .
I 'm gonna make sure that guy turns into a crazy eating thing .
Rock star poops his pants out of fear , refuses to sign his soul over to the devil , we all go home happy .
All right , bring it .
Yo , Ry-on .
Is that how you say it ?
Ry-on ?
- Rian .
- Rian , all right .
Hey , listen , Ryan ,
I came to the show tonight with 10 very open-minded young ladies who are just dying to meet a real star . You . - Well , let 's go !
- All right .
There 's a star right here !
Just under here .
Hey , Ryan .
Where are ... all the open-minded ladies ?
We 're about to show you what 's going to happen if you sign your soul away to the devil .
You see him ?
He 's actually an escaped soul from hell , and in a second , he 's going to turn into a monster .
You guys are nuts .
- No , whoa , whoa .
- Come on , let me out .
Listen to me .
You sign that contract , you 're gonna spend the rest of eternity with monsters like this .
- Why isn 't he eating the bacon ?
- We should have cooked it .
Benji , get it right in his face .
You 're making us look bad .
That 's Canadian back bacon !
Don 't be a jerk !
These people kidnapped me .
You need to call the police .
- Shut up , and eat the bacon !
- Hey , hold on , relax .
- Everybody just relax , all right ?
Move out of the way .
- You don 't scare me .
Performing in front of thousands of people tonight , now that 's scary .
By the way , did you catch the show ?
I thought it went really good .
- I need you to move .
- Fellas , listen .
Tonight , the audience and I were like one .
We connected .
Just like I 'm gonna connect with you , because my music has a simple message ...
Oh , sweet muscular Mary !
Oh , my god , my hand !
- My hands !
- Sock , call 9-1-1 !
I 'm gonna go after it !
- No , don 't ...
Sammy !
- My hand !
Well , that worked .
Hi .
Brought you flowers , ' cause ...
Didn 't know what else to get you .
Hey , they put it back on , that 's great .
Yeah , great .
- You ... in pain ?
- I can 't feel my hand , bro .
In here , wreckage .
Listen , Ryan , I want to apologize .
Things got way , way out of hand back there .
And I ...
Dude , what are you talkin 'about ?
- Your hand .
- I was in shock .
I don 't remember what happened to my hand .
I don 't remember anything after the second encore .
Doc says a bear probably chomped it .
Listen , Ryan ...
About the contract ...
Dude , I can 't even get Jerry on the phone .
I killed at that concert last night , and today , nothin ' .
Like I don 't even exist .
You 're right , man .
He is the devil .
Now I got nothin ' .
Rachel !
- Are you OK ?
- What are you doin 'here ?
I called her .
You came back ?
You forgive me ?
Actually , I just wanted to make sure you weren 't gonna die or anything .
So ...
OK .
No , wait !
I 'm out of the life , baby .
I can 't rock out no more .
I don 't need crowds of adoring fans anymore , Rachel .
I just need you .
Concert of one .
I just don 't know if I can believe you , Ryan .
You 've told me a thousand times you were gonna give up rock and roll for me .
Yeah , but now I have no feelings in 4 out of my 5 fingers .
- Really ?
- Yeah .
- Really numb ?
- Bear chomp .
- Mum .
- Bert .
- Morris .
- Howdy .
I 'm just gonna get this all out , OK ?
Cards on the table .
I may ... have reacted poorly ... before .
I thought that you were being impulsive by getting married , and I wanted you to see that you were making a mistake .
OK , but now I can see that maybe that is something you need to be happy .
So I am willing to accept Morris into this family ... and forgive you
for marrying him without my blessing .
- OK ?
- Thank you , bert .
Great .
All right , let me go unpack my schnibs .
Oh , Bert , you can 't unpack .
No , I have to .
I have a ton of laundry for you to do .
No , Bert ...
Only Morris and I are going to live here now .
- What ?
- Bert ,
- you 're a man now .
- Yes .
You 're 25 .
You need to leave the nest .
No , mom , that is not you talking right now .
That is him , all right ?
You are not my dad , guy !
This isn 't Morris talking .
Now , this time apart has made me realize that we 'd both be happier if there was some distance between us .
It 's hard , but I know it 's what 's best for us .
It 's what 's best for you .
You listen to me .
I am going to go into my room and give you a few minutes to cool off .
When I return , you 'll have come back to your crazy senses .
You turned my room into a pottery studio ?
- Hi .
- Hi .
- Oh , um , sorry .
- No , no , no problem .
OK . Thank you .
Uh , Sam said you wanted to talk to me .
Yeah , listen ,
I just feel like you and I got off on the wrong foot , and , I don 't know , I kinda feel like I 'm getting this ... vibe , I guess from you , like , who is this chick hanging out with my friend Sam ?
I don 't blame you , 'cause ... ' cause you don 't know me .
Right ...
So let me tell you this story .
When I was in high school ,
I had this boyfriend , and we were madly in love .
And then he suddenly dumped me for this other girl .
Totally broke my heart .
So I ...
Well , I didn 't take it very well .
Yeah , I got this giant knife and I went to this girl 's house and was gonna find her , but she wasn 't there , so I just slashed her tires .
But I 've been through therapy , and I have found a way to control my emotions , pretty much .
So anyway , hope that lets you know a little bit more about me .
And one of these days , I 'd really like to hear one of your stories .
There you go .
Hey , big shot .
Hey .
That 's you ,
Mr. Big shot .
Feelin 'pretty good about yourself , huh ?
- You really put one over on me .
- I don 't know what you 're talking about .
Oh , Ryan 's soul .
I had it all lined up .
Primed to take it , then you stole it right out from under me .
You beat me to the punch .
I underestimated you , Sammy .
Big time .
You 're quite the sly fox .
Oh , come on .
I know you want to gloat about it right now .
Admit it .
I won 't be mad .
Yeah , it feels pretty good .
Send an evil soul to hell , save a good soul from being damned , I like it .
Yeah , there you go , see ?
Plus , you got the best of me .
Now , don 't tell me that doesn 't give you a rush .
Yeah , it does .
I guess you can 't win ' em all .
Oh , yeah . I guess not .
You said you wouldn 't be mad !
No , this isn 't me mad , Sam .
This is me disappointed .
You should see me when I 'm mad .
It 's really something .

Today you 're much nicer .
Professor , send me a postcard when you 're there .

Hold still !
Your boys should see you like this .
Let 's get back to work !
Actually , you 're a pretty handsome man .
Does it hurt ?

You 're all right again ?
Excuse me , Professor .
Why are there no drinks being served ?
That 's sailor 's wallet is bursting .
So what ?
Send Guste !
Are you crazy ?
He wants you !
I don 't do that .
I 'm an artist !
What do you say to that ?
What ideas this girl has !
Good evening !
Here I am .
Just arrived form Calcutta .
From my cargo !
Let go and get out !
But I haven 't done anything .
Wretch !
Get out !
Your daddy ?
How dare you molest this lady ?
Do you have a subcription to " this lady " ?
Silence !
Miserable procurer !
Get out !
But Professor , you have no right ...
Miserable pimp !
Who do you think you are ?
This man ordered champagne !
I 'll pay for everything !
Get out !
He called me a procurer !
But Captain , don 't make such a noise !
You 'll have the police at my neck !
Yes , the police .
I 'll get the police , you crook !
He wanted to kill me !
It 's a long time since people fought over me .
I only did my duty .
Don 't get upset , Professor .
Let 's have a drink .
May I propose a very special ...
Excuse me , Professor , but the police are here .
They mustn 't find you here .
I have nothing to hide !
But we do .
They mustn 't see you .
I have nothing to hide !
We 'll have to open a boarding house in the basement .
The gentleman claims he was assaulted here .
He wanted to kill me ...
kill me !
Who did ?
Where is the rascal ?
Arrest this one , officer .
He attacked me on the stage !
Sure .
Leave me alone with that nonsense .
Where are you hiding , you rascal ?
What is it you want ?
I wasn 't even here .
Come here .
I 've finally got you .
Get out of here !
Your time has come !
Get out of here .
You too !
Brats !
That 's him !
He wanted to kill me , officer !
Excuse me , Professor ...
He insulted me .
This man wants to press charges against you .
Very well !
I will press charges , too !
What do you mean , " press charges " ?
Arrest him !
- Be quiet !
- Nobody 'll make me shut up !
We 'll see to that .
Off to the police station !
He tried to kill me .
" Procurer " , he called me !
I won 't put up with this !
I assume you realize the consequences of this incident for you .
Take that cigarette out of your mouth !
Do you hear me ?
Confess !
What did you come here for ?
The same as you , Professor .
Get out !
You haven 't heard the last of this !
Fine job , Professor !
Here , have a drink !
" Garbage " !
Miserable wretches !
You haven 't heard the last of this !
For God 's sake , what 's wrong , Professor ?
I 'll be all right .
I 'm better already .
Those hooligans !
You 've chosen a fine profession !
You shouldn 't get so upset .
Damn that bell !
What 's going on here ?
The place is half empty already !
Quit complaining !
Who brought the Captain in ?
All right , get going !
Come on out , Professor .
And listen .
It 'll make you feel better .
You gave me quite a punch ... but I 'm not the kind to bear a grudge .
I 'll get you some special medicine from my personal pharmacy .
Put this behind your necktie !
You really think this will help ?
Of course !
It 'll put some marrow in your bones !
Good ?
Now you 're presentable again .
Come with me .
- Come on out .
- Why ?
Don 't you want to hear Lola sing ?
A mysterious glimmer
A " je-ne-sais-pas-quoi "

Ladies and gentlemen !
I would like to introduce to you our very special guest for tonight ,
Dr. Immanuel Rath ,
Professor at the local college !
From head to toe l 'm programmed forlove Cause that is my world
And nothing else what can I do ?
It is my nature I can only love

Like moths around the light lfthey get burnt lt 's not my fault
" DO right AND FEAR NO ONE "
Professor !
Breakfast !
Morning , Immanuel !
Good morning .
Breakfast , Professor !
Come on , darling .
Coffee 's getting cold .
Take a seat .
Say , sweetheart , do you always snore like this ?
I 'm afraid I went a little overboard last night .
Bah , that little champagne ...
You can handle that .
Three .
You 're a really sweet one .
Good ?
Delicious !
See ?
You could have that every day .
Why not ?
After all , I 'm not married .
I have to go to school .
lmmediately !
Come here .
Hold still !
There ... so you 'll think of me .
What 's this ?
No goodbye ?
One more kiss .
Do you still love me ?
Yes , yes ...
Bye .
Watch out for the tram !
Morning , Professor !
Sit down !
Professor !
It smells like garbage in here !
I 'll have you all put in jail !
Miserable brats !
Leave the classroom !
into the schoolyard !
We 'll see to the rest !
Not without talent .
I can understand quite a bit ... but to put one 's future on the line for this kind of woman !
I beg your pardon ?
You 're talking about my future wife !
You 're joking !
I 'm dead serious .
And I forbid any further comment !
I 'm very sorry , but I have to report this matter .
Hurry up .
The train won 't wait for us because of you !
Come here .
Don 't you have anything to do ?
Why did I ever marry you !
I 've asked that myself .
Why are you standing around ?
You know the way !
How nice of you to come and say goodbye !
My dear Miss Lola , I ...
And those pretty flowers !
Thanks !
Don 't make such a sad face .
I 'll be back next year .
My dear Miss Lola , I brought you something else .
Will you accept this as a present from me ?
And may I at the same time ask for your hand ?
Will you marry me ?
God , you 're so cute !
I hope , my child , you realize the seriousness of this occasion .
Ladies and gentlemen !
Do you have to babble all the time ?
Here we go again !
My wedding was beautiful , too .
If I had only met you then ... maybe I 'd be the wife of a Professor now , too .
Now I only have this " magician " !
Yes , I am a magician !
He 'll do one of his tricks again .
I will now take the liberty to pull a few eggs from under the Professor 's nose .
You see my hand is empty !
Here , you can keep it .
Would you give me my small suitcase ?
You 're hopeless case !
Why did you pack these postcards ?
What a stupid question !
We sell them every night .
Not as long as I own a penny !
You never know ...
Better keep them .
watch out forblondes
There 's something special about them You can 't see it at first glance But something is there
A little flirting is alright
But remembershe 's a predator watch out forblondes
How 's the business ?
Two postcards ...
lgnorant bunch !
Who are you to judge them ?
You 'd do better to shave !
Look at yourself !
No wonder you do poor business !
Don 't look at me like that !
You 're not at the college anymore !
He has a point .
You really should shave .
Who do you think you are , calling them an " ignorant bunch " ?
After all , we live off them .
Yes , we live off them ...
" We live " ...
Leave , if you don 't like it .
I will ...
I 'll go ... I can 't stand it anymore !
Rather die like a dog somewhere than go on living like this ...
Give me my stockings .
Quick , my curling iron !
It 's far too hot !
Well , Professor , how are we today ?
How about a cigar ?
Havana with sumatra leaf wrap !
You seem to be in an especially good mood today .
I am !
I have every reason to be .
But you should be , too .
You 'll be my number one attraction !
Don 't make fun of the old man !
But your husband has become a big shot !
Look at the contract , sealed via telegraph .
And where ?
At the " Blue Angel " !
- At the " Blue Angel " ?
- Yes .
We 're going to your hometown .
There will be a big announcement .
Never !
I 'll never go back there !
You 'll change your mind .
Never !
Yes , you will !
For five years you 've lived off this woman ... and now that you have the chance to earn a few Marks yourself , the Professor says no .
Leave him alone .
He 'll go .
We 'll leave tomorrow morning .
That 's it !
Never !
Ask of me what you want but that ...
Don 't get nervous .
I won 't do it !
Never !
As you wish .
I 'd never thought I 'd be crawling back into this hole again .
My establishment ... a hole ?
My wife !
She hasn 't changed .
You haven 't gotten any slimmer , have you ?
You haven 't lost much weight , either .
Why should I ?
Business is going well .
What about you ?
The last three weeks were a disaster !
Goodbye , Director .
It 's " Goodbye , Master ! "
See you , but not in the next ten years , I hope .
Your joint 's okay for selling fish , not for a class act like mine .
Who 's that ?
One more week with him , and I could have closed down .
So many handsome men in one place ?
Don 't miss your train .
What do you know about love ?
Allow me to introduce myself :
Mazeppa .
Adelbert Mazeppa , strong man .
So what ?
I 'm a man of action .
I 'll stay because of you !
Not so fast !
We 've got plenty of time , haven 't we ?
I can wait .
Go home quietly .
It 's sold out !
watch out forblondes
There 's something special about them
You don 't see it at first glance But something 's there
A little flirting is alright
But always remember she 's a predator watch out forblondes
This evening will determine your whole career .
If everything goes well , you 've got it made .
You 'll do Berlin ,
London ,
New York !
Stop it !
He 'll get delusions !
We 're still at the " Blue Angel " .
Don 't be a killjoy !
Where 's the nose ?
You had it !
Who had it ?
Don 't let him make you nervous .
I know how you feel .
I felt the same way the first time around .
Shut up for a few minutes , will you ?
Chairs ... more chairs !
Even the mayor is here !
Then I 'll risk a glance , too .
Just don 't get nervous , Professor .
We 're completely sold out .
Everybody 's here :
your colleagues , your students , everybody .
Just don 't get nervous , Professor !
He 's right .
No reason to be nervous .
Keep calm !
Look at me , for example !
Now it counts .
When I see a beautiful woman , I go on the offensive .
I 'm known for that .
What 's wrong ?
Why do you look at me like that ?
Every time I 'm in a good mood you try to spoil it !
What 's going on here ?
Bad blood ?
Well , that happens in the best families !
Allow me to introduce myself :
Adelbert Mazeppa , strong man .
Why are you still here ?
Go out and do your number .
What 's wrong with the guy ?
Have a drink , my dear colleague !
That never hurts .
The guy 's a bit off .
Where are you hiding ?
What 's wrong with you ?
Lola , come down !
I won 't go on stage !
Have you gone crazy ?
Quitting minutes before the show !
What 's the idea ?
You don 't want to go on stage ?
You will go on stage !
Put the wig on !
What 's this ?
You don 't want to go on stage ?
I won 't have any of this in my place !
Ladies and gentlemen , I apologize for the delay ...
Does someone have a bellyache ?
But you 'll be compensated generously by the immediate beginning of this truly international number .
As a special feature on this act , I would like to introduce to you a man whom you all know for his pedagogical achievements ... at the local college .
Give us the Professor !
I can see you don 't need any further introduction ...
Of course , I am talking about our most popular Professor Dr. Immanuel Rath !
Come out now !
You 'll sabotage the whole number !
Ladies and gentlemen , allow me to introduce to you ...
August , my apprentice sorcerer .
You can see I 'm working without any special tools , just my bare hands .
What you can see here is an ordinary top hat .
With no false bottom , no secret chamber , no trap door .
This top hat ...
I will put on August 's head and instantly conjure up from under it a living dove .
I know you all think the dove has already been put there .
But no .
See for yourself . Empty .
Empty ...
All empty !
One more proof .
A dagger ...
Ladies and gentlemen , do not become alarmed if you see the gun in my right hand .
See ?
August has a bird .
This is disgusting !
Call the police !
Mr. Sorcerer , I 've run out of eggs ...
Would you be so kind to conjure some up for me ?
Of course .
From under August 's nose , I will now conjure up some eggs .
Pull yourself together , August !
You were a professor once !
You all think August has the eggs under his head .
But no !
The eggs !
Where are the eggs ?
Right away , ladies and gentlemen .
One ... two ... three ...
An egg !
Where 's the " Cock-a-doodle-do " ?
A genuine egg !
Lay more eggs !
If you don 't crow this time , I 'll kill you !
An egg !
A genuine egg !
Come on !
Crow !
I 'll kill you !
Crow !
Do your crowing !
What 's wrong with you ?
What do you want from me ?
Was that necessary ?
I don 't understand you .
A fine , well-educated man ...
All this because of a woman !
Relax now .
Everything will be all right .
From head to toe l 'm programmed forlove Because that is my world
And nothing else what can I do ?
It is my nature ... I can only love
Men swarm around me like moths around the light when they get burnt lt 's not my fault
From head to toe l 'm programmed forlove
Because that is my world And nothing else Subtitling :
You must get this amount or it will be serious.Your Father
" First call for lunch in the dining car " !
Your handkerchiefs are under your shirts .
Use a clean one every day .
Don 't stay out late at night
Don 't take up with strangers .
Remember we are depending on you to do your best .
Was that the first call for luncheon ?
Guess so .
It 's the first one I 've heard , ma 'am .
Maybe I made a mistake sending ' Lem to Chicago ... alone .
I raise wheat to sell , not to play with !
Every grain counts !
Give us this day our daily bread ... .
Get to work , Kate ... that fan 's for the files !
If the files are as hot as I am , they need it !
Can you beat it ?
He 's praying !
Betcha two bits he 's gonna take a chance on the hash !
I 'd like some corned beef hash and coffee , please .
You win !
It was my fault ... for putting ' em there .
Mother .
No .. pa is Scotch Ma is Canadian and I 'm plain American .
Lonesome in the big city , aint it ? What you doin ' here ?
I 'm down here to sell our wheat crop .
Well , old wheat king , how about some bread pudding for desert ?
I always do that at home . It makesMa 's work easier .
Living on a farm must be wonderful !
I 'm certainly glad to have met you ! I 'm glad too .
CROP ESTIMATE PUTS CORN PRICE UP , WHEAT DOWN .
No letter from Lem yet .
I 'm worried , Mother .
Lem 's doin ' what 's right ...
You keep forgettin ' our boy 's a grown man now .
maybe you 're right , but I can 't help thinkin' of him as a little shaver .
Just the same , if he don 't sell right , I 'll never be able to make both ends meet !
How does he rate a private breeze ?
How old is this fish anyway ?
Don 't ask me Mister ! Look in his mouth !
Figurin ' how much it 'll cost to take her out tonight , Buddy ?
I sold the wheat today ...
I hope Pop won 't be mad .
He sent you to sell it , didn 't he ?
But i didn 't get his price .
It was droppin ' so fast I was afraid to hold out any longer .
I 'd rather be deaf than blind , wouldn 't you ?
I can see you 'd be nice company .
What do you do with your evenings ?
You 'll never know !
You shouldn 't ' a done that ! Fighting over me !
I 'd fight anybody who tried to lay a hand on you !
I 'm going home ... . on the one o 'clock train .
Cut short the side order , Kate ... the boss is givin ' you the eagle eye !
There 's something I wanted to ask ..
I wanted to ask ... If you ... If you ...
Guess one place is good as another . It 's all a wash-out , If you ask me !
Give my love to the cows and the chickens !
I 'll wait a minute .
YOUR WEIGHT and YOUR FORTUNE .
If you marry the one you are thinking of all will be well .
I left something behind ... got to get it .
If we get married right away we can be home by morning .
Just married a sweet girl waitress in big resyaurant 69 00 : 30 : 55,050 - - 00 : 31 : 00,706 Know you will love her . Bringing her home tomorrow .
Good girls ain 't that free and easy about getting married . The boy 's been roped in !
Oh , Lem , it 's wonderful to have a home and a mother and father ... And a man of my own a real two-fisted guy ... to take care of me !
Ma ... this is Kate !
This is the prettiest bridal bouquet I ever saw ! You 're Marie , ain 't you ?
If I catch you playin ' with wheat again , I 'll whip you !
Father ... here 's Kate .
How much did you get for the wheat ?
Didn 't I tell you not to sell under $ 1.15 ?
If you 'd been tending ' to my business 'stead of your own , you 'd ' a waited .
Change your clothes and get to work !
The harvesters are comin ' in the mornin ' !
Don 't mind Father ... . he 's upset .
And he never can bear to be crossed .
I want to talk to you !
I 'd like to know what you expected to get out of marrying ' Lem .
What any other wife expects . I married Lem because I ...
.. I love him ..
Women like you love for what they can get out of it But you 'll get nothing from me !
You certainly smeared it that time ! Now I 'll never give Lem up !
...
I am going to make a man of Lem Tustine in spite of you !
... .. ... And if you think he 'll let me go away without him guess again !
My son does what I say and so will you !
I 'm master here !
Your ... father ... hit me !
I can 't strike my own father !
And this is our honeymoon !
I got some surprise for you !
Lem 's went an ' married a city girl !
Good looker ?
The old man 's like a mad bull ...
tryin ' to bust it up An ' last night , she slept in the bedroom alone ' an he slept in the loft !
I 'm gonna have first look !
Maybe I 'll help the old man bust it up ! .
Well , Pa-in-law , where 's the blushing ' bride ?
Get busy !
Do somethin' to earn your keep !
How do you like bein ' here ?
Bein ' here 's all right ...
I don 't think much of the company .
Don 't waste any more time ...
we got to get started .
Aw , she don 't weigh no 187 pounds !
I don 't want anything to eat .
Looks like you 've popped into a hornrt 's nest .
You said it !
There 's your chance , Mac ...
to check up on that weighing ' machine !
Kate ... we can 't go on like this ...
I didn 't think anybody could ever come between us ... ...
Kate , Let 's forget this quarrel and be happy .
I love you ... you 're my wife .
If you marry the one you are thinking of all will be well .
This aint the bridal suite .
You mind your own business !
that goes for all of you !
And if anyone wants an argument , I got two good ones !
Hailstorm Sweeps Canada
There 's a hailstorm comin ' !
We 'll have to work all night to save the crop !
Divide the men in two shifts , Mac ... double pay for overtime !
... double pay for overtime !
HAILSTORM SWEEPS CENTRAL CANADÁ
WHEAT CROP RUINED
I cut my hand on the machine .
Say , are you crazy ?
A girl like you buryin' yourself in a dump like this !
What 's the matter with you hicks ?
Don 't people ever fall in love out here ?
You didn 't look exactly lovin' when you ran out of that room tonight .
Why don 't you chuck all this ... come away with me when we finish the harvesting ' ...
I 'll treat you right ...
and that 's more than old Tustine will ever let Lem do !
I always knew you wasn 't a good woman !
I 'm goin ' to find Lem now ... and tell him what kind of wife he 's got
What 's the use of talkin' to that old devil ?
I know how to get even with him ...
The storm 'll be here in no time ...
I used to think the country was clean , that men out here were decent ...
But you 're all alike ... cheap sports !
You all talk big when you want something !
If that 's the way you feel about it , I 'll give you somethin ' more 'n talk !
I don 't want anything from you !
I can fight for myself !
You agreed to work all night !
We 've changed our minds .
We 're quitting ' now !
My father says he caught you and Mac planning to run away together .
Haven 't you anything to say ?
Not a thing ... you can believe it or not !
If I thought it was true ...
Yeah ?
What would you do ?
Run to Papa ?
I 'd smash Mac so 's he 'd never come hanging around my wife again !
You got to learn any man can get a wife !
But it takes more 'n a license and a wedding ring to hold her !
I guess our marriage was a mistake .
I 'll shoot the first man that leaves my farm !
Listen to me Kate .
I 've settled your score with the old man !
I 've called the men out ... and we 're leavin 'the wheat to rot in the fields .
I 'm leavin ' with the men in ten minutes and you 're comin ' with me ...
.. If you don 't I 'll say you put me up to ruining ' the wheat !
Are you comin ' ?
Yes ... yes .. but I 've got to have time to pack .
Here 's somethin ' Mac forgot !
We 're waitin ' for Kate ... she 's comin ' with me !
I thought I could help you by staying , then you believed that lie about me and Mac .
Mac tried to get me to go with him but I wouldn 't .
Maybe with me gone , They 'll work and save the wheat
I never loved anybody but you , Goodbye , Kate .
Father ... it 's Lem !
FATHER !
Son , you know I ...
I wasn 't meaning ' to shoot you .
There 's some things worse 'n shooting .
One of ' ems the hell .. ... you been putting Kate and me through .
... Now I 'm going to find Kate and take her away ...
where we can live our own lives .
I been wrong , Lem , and I 'm sorry Don 't leave us !
Let me find Kate and beg her to stay .
No ... I got to find her myself .
I won 't try to stop you again , boys .
You can go whenever you want to .
We ain 't goin ' to leave till your wheat 's in !
You 're on the wrong road .
There 's only more farms like ours that way That 's the road to the station .
Let me give you a lift , Kate .
Remember when we first came along this road how happy we were ?
When I got your note Kate , I went crazy ...
Father , here 's Kate .
Can you forgive me ...
Kate ?
Come back with us ...
to your home .
THE END
Now listen here , fat-head
We 're back home again and that 's because we did a little fighting And I know what you 're thinking
You 're thinking : Well , here comes us
The Foreign Legion
Each man a hero all the booze in the world made for us and the women thrown in
this time , you 're gonna behave yourselves like gentlemen even if it 'll kill you But you 're wrong .
Yes , I 'm talking to you you heard what I said !
Why don 't you get back in line ?
What are doing with your fingers ?
- Nothing ... yet - get in there
- all packed up , Sir. ready to land
- Thank you .
There you are .
I hope I haven 't forgotten anything .
Merci , Monsieur .
you 're very kind
Your first voyage to Morocco ?
Yes . I make the trip quite often .
perhaps I can be of some service ?
I 'd be happy to help you
I won 't need any help
You can always reach me at this address , Mademoiselle .
- Good evening , Officer - evening
Do you know who that woman is ?
A vaudeville actress probably just how do you figure that ?
we can 't even remember a day
We call them suicide passengers .
One-way ticket . they never return .
well the wanderer returns .
how are you ?
- When did you get back ?
- last night .
Alexander , I 'd like you to meet an old friend of mine , M. La Bessière .
- a citizen of the world - very happy
- You 're a Frenchman , aren 't you ?
- Yes . - Mrs. Marten .
- Aren 't you the painter La Bessière ?
- I paint when I find the time .
- He has all the time that he needs .
He would be a great painter if he were not so rich .
Colonel Buchard .
- Colonel .
- Charmed
- Won 't you join us ?
I 'd love to , but isn 't that César and his wife ?
- yes .
- see you later
It 's awfully nice to see you in Morocco again .
- I 'm very happy to meet you , even in this heat .
- yes it is hot . - and you Mme César ?
how have you been ?
- I 've been bored .
We 've missed you .
I feel greatly flattered .
your rich friend is very democratic
He can afford to be .
he 's always chosen his own friends as a young vicar with the captain in the German air-force before joining the legion
- And perhaps you can give me the history of his wife ?
- The less said about that , the better .
The house is packed
the house is packed !
This is a great night for you .
If you make a hit , you can stay here as long as you like .
now , you may have heard of me in Europe or not .
my house is patronized by the finest society in Morocco .
What was I going to say ?
Oh yes .
pick yourself a protector
It will give us prestige .
An officer in the legion .
They will tell you that the officers in the legion are not important . that the common legionnaire is the thing
They will tell you that Private so-and-so is a Russian Prince or an ex-General who joined the legion to forget his past .
The private in the Legion is a no bargain with 75 centimes per day . Don 't believe it !
Thank you .
Pick the officers !
They have the money .
Ladies and Gentlemen .
it is no small task , as you know ... to supply my establishment with new talent .
For some reason , the artists I engage don 't last very long .
It may be the heat .
I do my best .
I pay the highest wages in Africa . Mille grazie , signore e signori .
Anyway , I 'll open the program tonight with Mlle Amy Jolly , a newcomer whom I hope you will receive with your usual discriminating kindness
If I remember correctly , this audience shows its usual discriminating kindness by receiving its newcomers rather unpleasantly .
sit down , go ahead .
may I offer you this glass of Champagne ?
- May I have this ?
- Of course .
sing your number once and then sell the apples
That 's the most important thing Sell the apples !
10 % is yours , 90 % is mine .
you 'll make a fortune
Yeah .
Over my dead body damme los flores or go a casa
well , what 's keeping you , baby ?
what can I bid for my apple ?
the fruit that made Adam so wise
on the historic night when he took a bite he discovered a new paradise ?
and apple , they say , keeps the doctor away while his pretty young wife has the time of her life
with the butcher , the baker the candle-stick maker oh what can I bid for my apple ?
We meet once more , monsieur
I didn 't anticipate this pleasure so soon .
can I also have an apple ?
- but I have no change for that .
- I hardly expected you to have .
You are again very kind .
Mademoiselle , may I have the honour of your company after the performance ?
I 'm sorry . I have disposed for the rest of the evening .
- some other time perhaps ?
- of course
An apple , Monsieur ?
Madame ?
Don 't waste your time down there .
There 's no money in the pit !
isn 't there ?
Thanks for the flower , Mademoiselle .
can I offer you an apple , too ?
Lend me 20 francs
That makes 60
Two weeks pay is a lot of money for an apple .
You can have it for nothing if you like .
nothing doing .
I always pay for what I get .
I 'd sit down if I were you .
You 're pretty brave with women
What 's the matter ? Don 't you like brave men ? perhaps .
Your change soldier
Tom ?
well , if it isn 't Mme César
Tom , I must see you tonight ?
what do you mean tonight ?
what if your husband sees you tonight ?
He isn 't going to see me isn 't he ?
what if he does ?
César 's wife is above suspicion .
You may know something about ancient history , but I know something about husbands .
It 's you ?
What 's the matter ?
Were you expecting someone else ?
Can I offer you something ?
Cognac ? too hot .
got any gin ?
Yes .
- Cigarette ? - Thanks .
You made this place look very nice
It looks different now . how do you know ?
have you been here before ?
Well , I have been stationed in this town for a long time .
aren 't you drinking ?
No .
Well , to you
You can smell the desert tonight .
Hot , isn 't it ?
faded
You can go now , soldier .
you won 't have any trouble getting rid of me nothing like independence , isn 't there ?
well maybe I am independent .
With women
You evidently don 't think much of women
I tell you lady , it 's their fault , not mine
been in the legion very long ?
almost three years
Three years seems like 300 you sound tired of life
I don 't know whether I am or not
I was when I joined this outfit how about you , Mademoiselle ?
Long enough .
- tired of it ? - no
You 've a lot of pictures of that man . Is he your husband ?
husband ?
I never found a man good enough for that .
that 's just how I fell about women .
how long ago was that picture taken ?
why ?
that looks like a Russian sable .
that coat 's worth a load of shades . Do you still have it ?
don 't be absurd .
if I still had that coat I wouldn 't be here
What in the name of ten thousand purples did you come to a country like this for , anyway ?
I understand that men are never asked why they enter the Foreign Legion . That 's right .
They never asked me and if they had I wouldn 't have told .
When I crashed the legion I ditched the past .
There 's a Foreign Legion of women , too .
but we have no uniforms no flags
and no medals , when we are brave
No wound stripes when we are hurt
Look here , is there anything I can do to help you ?
No .
I 've heard that before .
Or do you think you can restore my faith in men ?
not me you 've got the wrong man for that
anybody who has faith in me is a sucker
You 'd better go now
I 'm beginning like you .
I 've said to women about everything a man can say .
I 'm gonna to tell you something I 've never told a woman before .
I wish I 'd met you 10 years ago .
- Good night .
- Good night .
And thanks
well , the night 's still young
There 's your key , lady . If I were you I wouldn 't hand it around .
I hear something
taking a walk ?
To get some fresh air ?
No , I was looking for you
It 's good that you found me .
This quarter isn 't safe at night .
I 'd better take you home
- 120 ?
- No , I wish I were
I only feel so light to you because your arms are so powerful .
well , we 'll get along a bit better this time
Look out !
you 'd better come here , there 's gonna be trouble
I give you one more chance :
Who were those two women ?
get your knee out of my hip !
Do you think the two women you are trying to protect are worth it ?
well I think one of them is .
mon Adjudant , M. La Bessière is here to take you to his club .
ask him to wait .
I 'll be through in a minute .
no , let him come in .
- I didn 't know that the military was quite so busy .
- Oh yes , we are busy
Sit down !
perhaps you can learn something about this country which you think is so marvellous
got a match ?
This little matter also involves someone you 're interested in .
I 'm properly curious bring in that woman
Mademoiselle , I think you know M. La Bessière
- very happy to meet you again , Mademoiselle .
- sit down
I 'm happy to meet you again .
It 's so nice of you to have come , Mademoiselle .
You were present at this affair at which the prisoner with his customary bravery severely wounded two helpless natives
Those natives were not helpless .
They attacked us .
Who was the other woman ?
I don 't know .
I 'd like to know , too
do sit down
The curious part of this is I 'm the only one that really seems to know who this other woman is
If you do know , you 'd better keep it to yourself
Captain César , don 't lose your temper
Return the prisoner to the guard-house
I appreciate your attempt to keep the name of my wife out of this
that 's alright , sir
You may go now , Mademoiselle
I 'll join you in a minute
You look charming this morning
What will they do to him ?
I don 't know .
personally I shouldn 't care to have Adjudant César as an enemy .
I seem to have the unhappy faculty of bringing trouble wherever I go
Nonsense you know , I carry some weight with César .
possibly I can help you .
Every time a man has helped me there 's been a price .
What 's yours ?
My price ?
A smile ?
I haven 't got much more
shall we go ?
Here , take your pass . You 're a free man .
door 's right open and you can do what you like . 'til 7 o 'clock in the morning .
- What 's the idea of all this ?
- you 're leaving for Amalfa-Pass tomorrow - not me , I 'm beginning to like this town .
Tell César , I 'm not going you tell him yourself , he 's going along this time .
- Who 's going along ?
- you heard what I said César is going along this time
So that 's what it is . that 's why he didn 't recommend a court martial .
He 's gonna get me out on the road and face me in the proper direction .
well you got a gun with you , haven 't you .
you can 't get away with murder all your life that 's right , Sergeant .
your argument is perfectly sound , but nobody is gonna use me for target practice .
I 'm through with the army anyway .
I 've been looking for the right kind of woman all my life and I think I 've found her .
so I quit , take this thing and spend a few weeks somewhere along the blue Mediterranean so you 're quitting , eh ?
well nobody 's stopping you
By the way , you happen to remember what the penalty is for desertion ?
There 's a 100 ways to dying , brother , and I 'm picking my own way .
Go on , get out of here
He 's in there
I 've never known such a fortune in my life
He 's a rich man to buy Morocco .
Don 't forget me ! you 've met him in my theatre .
Good evening
Your flowers are wonderful any news of him ?
I did what I could .
they will not court-martial him .
they 're going to transfer him which means of course that he will have to leave town .
do you love him ?
I don 't know .
I hope not .
I can 't accept this .
It 's worth a fortune .
anything of less value would be unworthy .
I 've got to change
I 'd like to take you away from here .
Would you ?
exactly what do you offer now ?
the conventional thing
My offer is highly respectable :
marriage
You 're a strange man
Do you find it so strange that I shall be fond of you ?
must I answer you now ?
I 'd sleep better tonight if you did .
I don 't think I care to take advantage of your tempting offer .
- then you 're in love ?
- No , I don 't think I am .
supposing you had never met a certain private in the foreign legion what would your answer have been ?
might have been the same .
I don 't know .
I 'm sorry to intrude , but I 'm leaving for the Sahara in the morning and I just came to say good-bye
I think you two want to be alone .
I understand you are leaving on a rather strenuous journey .
- May I wish you good luck ? - Thanks
- à bientot , Mademoiselle - à bientot
Will you be gone long ?
When will I see you again ?
Maybe never .
Something tells me I 'm not coming back this time .
don 't go .
that 's just what I was thinking .
I could desert and board a freighter for Europe tonight
Why don 't you ?
I would in a minute if you 'd go with me .
Will you ?
Yes .
I 'll be back . Wait for me .
If you can spare one of your hands , I would like to say goodbye , too .
Goodbye , Mademoiselle .
Why didn 't you stay last night ?
I had a few other calls to make .
Who are those women ? Those women ?
I would call them the rear-guard .
How can they keep feet with the men ?
They catch up with them , and sometimes they don 't .
And very often when they do , they find their men dead .
Those women must be mad .
I don 't know .
you see , they love their men
I don 't see why we have to keep getting down all day ? We only have to get up again .
anyhow , those walking bed sheets can 't shoot straight .
If you go on like this , why don 't you quit ?
anyhow , I thought you were going to desert ?
I 've turned decent , Sergeant .
decent .
What did you say ?
decent .
I 'm in love .
you 'd better not go in .
- What 's wrong , Lo Tinto ?
- What 's wrong ?
She 's been drinking , like a fish
And don 't send her anymore flowers in pots
She threw just one at me an hour ago
- Hello there
How do you like me now ?
you seem gay tonight .
Have you had good news ? Have you heard from Private Brown ?
Not badly written for a soldier
perhaps it was for the best
Give me a drink
Call my chauffeur , Lo Tinto .
You 're losing your headlines tonight .
good .
I 'm not losing anything .
She 's been no use to me for three weeks .
Legionnaire Brown
Legionnaire Brown !
well , I had the right hunch , didn 't I ?
that 's too bad , Brown wait a minute .
give me those 20 Francs you owe me .
you know , that lady-killer was no bad soldier at that
destroy that machine-gun
May I go too , sir ?
You 're not at all excited .
read on the night of our engagement dinner , while we 're all waiting for you ?
everybody 's here .
I never believed they would come .
On the contrary .
They 're delighted to witness the unconditional surrender of the most exacting bachelor in the world .
I know .
You want to thank me for making you happy .
You want to thank me for giving you those pearls this morning
You want to thank me for this and you want to thank me for that ...
Shall we go down now ?
- Anything wrong ?
- César was killed .
I received the news this morning .
Legionnaire Tom Brown will probably come back tonight .
- Is his company returning ?
- What 's left of it .
you don 't need to be concerned about him . dead or alive there 's still time to tell me .
do come , they are waiting
Mohammed
Pick up those pearls and take them my room please
Where is Tom Brown ?
Was he killed ?
Not so rough , Mademoiselle I 'm liable to fall apart
We left him in at Amalfa .
You can 't kill that long drink of water .
Is he badly hurt ?
well , we didn 't ' go down there for any entertainment
I gotta get some sleep
Alexander , don 't you think it unusually hot this month ?
No , I don 't think so
You always disagree with me
When I came to Morocco as a boy , it snowing in the summer have you heard that before , M. La Bessière ?
I wasn 't listening , Colonel .
what did you say ?
When I came to Morocco as a boy ...
What did I say ?
When you came to Morocco as a boy , it rained or something .
That 's it
I have to go to him .
They left him in Amalfa .
- Is he badly wounded ?
- I hope not .
please don 't disturb yourselves and sit down
I don 't mind your hearing this
why not let me send a telegram and learn the details .
if his condition is serious we can drive down tomorrow .
I 'm going now .
order the car and pack my bag
you see , I love her
I do anything to make her happy .
Is Legionnaire Brown here ?
There is no Legionnaire Brown here .
- Are you sure ?
- well it might be under some other name .
have a look
Hello , Mademoiselle
What are you doing down here ?
I 'm looking for Legionnaire Tom Brown
You won 't find him down here , diese verdammte Schweinehund
He make believe that he 'd been wounded , but they find out and put him in another company
Is he still in town ?
He is round the corner , at the Christine .
And don 't forget to tell him to pay me the 60 Francs that owes me
Who is this girl ?
It wouldn 't be any good if I told you .
you love her very much ?
Yep .
Poor boy
What are you doing in this part of the world ?
I heard you were wounded .
Not me .
I never felt better in my life .
- Are you married ?
- No !
Why didn 't you return with your company ?
aren 't you gonna marry that rich friend of yours ?
of course !
Are you sure ?
I don 't change my mind
well then I wish you all the luck in the world , Mademoiselle
Rassemblement Back to the barracks Antreten , Ihr Schweinehunde , raus !
it 's gonna be a thirsty march
Have you lost something ?
Can I help you ?
go on. beat it .
I forgot my knife .
You forgot to say goodbye , too .
We leave at dawn .
Come and see us off. will you ?
maybe .
- Goodbye , Mademoiselle - Goodbye
Goodbye , Sir
The scorpion is an arachoid species found in various parts of the world
Its tail comprises five prismatic joints
The pincers , recalling those of the larger crayfsh are instruments of aggression and information
Its tail ends in a sixth joint a sac from which poison is injected by barbed sting
A lover of darkness , it burrows under stones to escape the glare of the sun
Antisocial , it ejects the intruder on its solitude
Such lightning strikes , such virtuosity in attack
Even a rat , for all its fury , falls prey to it
Some hours later
Stop it !
Perhaps I just happened to fall ?
No . We saw nothing
is there any news , yes or no ?
Yes , the Majorcans are here
Quick , to arms !
To the rear !
What about Péman ?
I 'm done for
So are we , but we 're going
Yes , but you 've got accordions hippopotamuses , wrenches mountain goats , and ...
Bollocks !
Let 's go ... and paintbrushes
This stone , on the site where the Majorcans died marks the founding of the city of Imperial Rome
Once mistress of the pagan world , now secular seat of the Church
Aspects of its stoutest pillar , the Vatican
The landlord 's terms are very favourable .
We can move in at once
Longing to see you , very soon now .
Your loving cousin
But the hurly-burly of modern life has overtaken the Imperial City
Sometimes on Sundays ...
Various picturesque aspects of the great city
Bandaged ?
Yes , it 's been sore for over a week ls Daddy home yet , Mummy ?
Yes , he 's in the dispensary
Then he 'll dress for the party
We went out together this morning and engaged four of them
The little moustached one sang like the rest
Only a pianist is lacking
But our priest is a fine violinist I think the musicians we have will be enough
Six of them placed near the microphone will make more noise than sixty ten kilometres away I know sound gets lost in the open air but we could bring the guests in close
Get a move on . The Majorcans will be arriving at nine
Bastard !
Filthy swine !
Keep your trap shut !
Want us to work you over ?
Here 's a taste of the rough stuff !
Enough is enough ;
let me show you who you 're dealing with
Let 's have a look , then
The International Goodwill Society hereby appoints you its special delegate
This document testifies to our faith in you
We pray that you will prove worthy of this trust we place in you and successfully complete your goodwill mission
On your spirit of self-sacrifice and your proven valour depend many lives
Children , women , old men The honour of our Fatherland rests on the outcome of this noble enterprise
At his magnificent Roman estate , the Marquis of X prepares for his guests
The Minister of the lnterior is on the telephone
You scoundrel !
You are entirely to blame !
You compromised me , too
Do you realize that not one child survived ?
Many women and old men perished , too
You 're bothering me about a few brats ?
Filthy ruffian , you 've dragged me down with you !
Dishonoured me !
You can die for all I care !
Then listen to my last words ...
Has he gone ?
Are you sleepy ?
I was just falling asleep
Where 's the light switch ?
At the foot of the bed
Your elbow 's hurting me
Move your head closer , ; the pillow is cooler on this side
Where 's your hand ?
That feels so good
Let 's just sit here and not move
Are you cold ?
No , I was falling
I 've been waiting so long for him
What joy ! What joy in having killed our children
My love ... my love ...
Just as these feathers fell , but a long way away the survivors from the Château de Selliny emerged to return to Paris
120 days earlier , four godless and unprincipled scoundrels had , driven by their depravity , shut themselves away to indulge in the most bestial of orgies
To them , the life of a woman mattered no more than that of a fly
They took with them eight lovely adolescent girls to serve as victims for their criminal desires plus four women well versed in debauchery whose narrative skills would serve to stimulate their already jaded appetites whenever interest flagged
Here are the survivors of these orgies , leaving the Château de Selliny
First and foremost of the four instigators , the Duc de Blangis
How 's that ?
Gotta hand it to you , Rico .
The old bean 's working all the time .
- What 'll it be , gents ?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two .
All right , sir .
" Underworld pays respects to Diamond Pete Montana . "
- What 's that gotta do with the price of eggs ?
Diamond Pete Montana .
He don 't have to waste his time on cheap gas stations .
He 's somebody .
He 's in the big town doing things in a big way .
And look at us .
Just a couple of nobodies , nothing .
Is that what you want , Rico ?
A party like that for you ?
" Caesar Enrico Bandello .
Honored by his friends . "
I could do all the things that fella does and more .
Only I never got my chance .
And what 's there to be afraid of ?
When I get in a tight spot , I shoot my way out of it .
Why , sure .
Shoot first and argue afterwards .
You know , this game ain 't for guys that 's soft .
Yeah , there 's money in the big town , all right .
And the women .
Good times , something doing all the time .
Exciting things , you know .
The clothes I could wear .
And then I 'd quit , Rico .
I 'd go back to dancing , like I used to before I met you .
I don 't know .
I ain 't made for this sort of thing .
Dancing .
That 's what I wanna do .
Dancing ?
Women ?
And where do they get you ?
I don 't want no dancing .
I 'm figuring on making other people dance .
- Oh , I ain 't forgetting about the money .
- Money 's okay , but it ain 't everything .
Be somebody .
Look hard at a bunch of guys and know they 'll do anything you tell them .
Have your own way or nothing .
Be somebody .
- You 'll get there , Rico .
- Yeah .
- You 'll show them .
- You know this was our last stand in this burg .
We 're pulling out .
- Where are we going ?
- East .
Where things break big .
So I beat it east , like I told you .
That 's all there is to it .
I wanna run with your mob , if you 'll let me .
What do you say ?
You won 't be sorry for letting me in .
I 'll do anything you say . I ain 't afraid of nothing .
You think you 're a hard guy ?
There 's nothing soft about me .
Nothing yellow .
I don 't quit .
- You got an idea you 're good , huh ?
- Give me a chance to show you .
- What do you know about me ?
- Oh , I heard plenty .
How you run things this end of town .
About this here Club Palermo , how it 's your front .
I got told enough .
- I guess you 're good with a rod too , huh ?
- Quick with it and sure .
Well , that don 't go around here .
That 's old stuff .
This ain 't the sticks .
Yeah , I get you .
All right .
You stick around .
But , remember , I 'm the boss .
And I give all the orders .
And when we split , we split my way .
- And no squawks .
You get me ?
- Yeah , sure , Mr. Vettori .
- All right , come on in , meet the boys .
- Sure .
Oh , they 're 100 percent , all right .
Every one of them .
There 's Tony Passa .
Can drive a car better than any mug in the town .
Otero .
He 's little , but he 's the goods all right .
Bat Carilla .
Killer Peppi .
Kid Bean .
And this one here , Scabby .
What a smart guy he is .
Boys .
Come on , Tony .
Wake up .
I want you to meet a new guy what 's gonna be with us .
This is ...
Caesar Enrico Bandello .
Oh , Little Caesar , huh ?
Yeah , sure .
Where did you get the new dancer , DeVoss ?
Olga brought him around a few days ago .
Not bad .
- All right .
- I 'll say he is .
Well , I got hold of a real dancer for a partner , didn 't I , Mr. DeVoss ?
He 's an elegant dancer .
We 'll panic them after a few rehearsals .
Say , you 're not trying to sell him to me , are you , Olga ?
Well , young fella , I guess 100 a week ought to buy you .
That 's more than I generally start with .
That 's swell with me , even though it don 't buy no limousines .
Gee , thanks , Mr. DeVoss .
You 'll never be sorry for this .
Come , Joey .
So it 's you and me from now on .
Well , I 'm glad .
And I 'm not ashamed to tell you .
I guess you know by this time how I feel about you .
That 's all right with you , isn 't it ?
Or have you got another girl ?
A steady , I mean .
Hundreds of them , sure . Only ...
Only , what 's the difference ?
This is gonna be real .
- We 'll make it mean something .
- Yeah , Joey , let 's .
Because I need somebody .
Somebody like you .
Awful bad .
- You believe me , Olga ?
- I want to believe you .
What 's that ?
What you got there , Joe ?
What are you doing with that ?
Can 't you forget you 've seen it ?
It won 't make no difference . Not between us , Olga .
Don 't worry , baby .
It 's just a little good-luck charm I carry around with me .
Is that your racket ?
Maybe .
I suppose I got no right to ask you , Joe .
But now ...
Now that we got an understanding .
Couldn 't you leave it ?
No .
I suppose I haven 't got the right .
What would be the good of you asking , kid ?
Once in a gang ...
- You know the rest .
- I don 't want to know .
Only maybe ...
Maybe it could be different this time .
If we try .
I 've never seen the guy that could get away with it yet .
Black .
Seven .
Sam Vettori is still waiting for you in your office .
All right , I guess I 'll have to see him .
I wonder what he wants here .
Hey , Ritz .
You 'd better stick with me .
I 'll need you in there .
- That Sam Vettori 's a no-good lug .
- You said it , boss .
Better let me go first .
Cut that .
Hello , Arnie .
Surprised to see me in your swell joint ?
Maybe I won 't be after you tell me what you want here .
Oh , I 'll tell you , all right .
Diamond Pete asked me to come up .
He 's coming up too .
- Pete Montana ?
- That 's who .
Well , if Pete wants you here , it 's got to be all right with me .
- Hello , Mr. Montana .
- Hello .
Hello .
- Hello , Arnie .
- Hello , how are you ?
- Hello , Vettori .
- Hello , boss .
Cigar ?
Thanks .
Thanks , Arnie .
Sit down , boys .
I got something to tell you .
A message from the Big Boy .
Now , listen .
Here 's the lowdown .
- The Big Boy says ...
- Just a minute , boss .
Hey , you .
Nobody asked you to be butting in here , did they ?
- Screw , mug .
- You ain 't giving me orders .
- You 're a fresh guy , huh ?
- Take it easy , Rico .
You go out there and wait for me .
Jake with me , boss .
Now , listen , boys .
Watch this guy McClure what 's head of the new crime commission .
He 's putting the screws on , and make no mistake about him .
Now , the Big Boy wants me to tell you guys to put the chains on your gorillas for the next few months .
Because if any of them go too far , it 'll be just too bad .
I 've never seen nobody the Big Boy couldn 't get to .
He can fix anything .
That 's why he 's the Big Boy .
This bird McClure will be pie for him .
- He 'll twist him around his little finger .
- Don 't kid yourself .
Nobody 's squaring nothing with McClure .
Not even the Big Boy .
Small jobs , that 's different .
We could spring guys for them .
But shooting ?
No , sir .
It 's guys like this torpedo of yours that cause all the trouble .
Who , Rico ?
He 's all right .
He 's a little quick on the trigger , but that 's because he 's new .
Yeah ? Well , it 's us that 'll swing for him if he shoots at the wrong time .
Now , remember what I told you .
Come on .
So long .
And you .
You take it easy with that cannon of yours .
Did you hear me ?
Yes , Mr. Montana .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night .
Do yourself a favor , will you , Rico ?
Leave your gat home on the piano the next job you pull .
Yeah , park it next to your milk bottle .
Hey .
Run your own mob , Arnie .
I 'll take care of mine .
Yeah , I 'll park it .
I don 't need no cannon to take care of guys like you , Mr. Lorch .
Yeah , we gotta be careful .
Little Arnie 's interested in this here nightclub .
- If it ever gets out who pulled the job ...
- They 'll never get wise to us .
They 're careless , but they 've never been tapped .
Yeah , but I don 't like the whole business .
Neither do I , Sam .
Honest , I don 't .
I couldn 't sleep last night .
I was up worried .
I don 't want to take any chances .
Not now the way they 're closing down on us .
What 's the matter , Tony , getting yellow ?
No , but , geez , none of us wanna hang , do we ?
You 'd like to quit , wouldn 't you ?
You 'd like to run out on us .
- You 're yellow , you dirty ...
- Wait a minute , Rico .
Where do you get that yellow stuff ?
You want to know who 's yellow , I 'll tell you .
Joe Massara , your pal .
- That 's why he didn 't show tonight .
- He 'll be here .
Just because ...
I know all about that stuff .
I 'm gonna give him 10 minutes more .
Then we 'll see .
Now , listen , Sam , Joe 's all right .
He 's the best front man in the world .
Why , he can go to a swell hotel and order a suite , a suite , and it 's all right .
Without Joe , we can 't pull the job , and you know it .
What 's that paper ?
It 's this layout I 've been figuring out with Scabby .
- What , this nightclub job ?
- Yeah .
Well , let me see it .
And until I say different nobody 's gonna plan for this mob but me .
You get me ?
He 'll learn .
Now , come here , you guys .
Now , get this .
Hello , Joe .
Hello , Rico .
Come here .
I told you to be here at 8 : 30 .
Oh , well , you see , I ...
I was busy .
I was rehearsing , and ...
- Oh , you know how it is .
- Yeah , I know how it is .
They 've been saying it , only I didn 't believe them .
They 're crazy when they call you yellow .
Tell them they can go to ...
Say , what 's the big idea of the rush anyway ?
It 's a little job we need you for .
A little job at the Bronze Peacock .
What do you mean ?
Are you trying to kid me or something ?
How can I take the chance ?
They 're all my friends , they all know me .
That 's why , they 'll never suspect you .
Now , don 't stall , Joe .
I ain 't stalling .
You gotta get me out of this , Rico .
You gotta .
I don 't want to ...
Well , don 't you see , I 'm working steady now , and ...
- Can 't a guy ever say he 's through ?
- You 're gonna be in on this , and you 'll like it .
The time is to be sharp midnight on New Year 's Eve .
I won 't .
I can 't .
I can 't , don 't you see ?
I ...
Well , gee , I ...
- I 'll be working New Year 's Eve .
- Now , listen , Joe .
This is the joint where you 're working .
And don 't you be forgetting it , either .
Come on in .
Well , maybe it ain 't so hot .
- Maybe we can 't buck Little Arnie .
- I can .
You 're too good , that 's what .
Hello , Joe .
You were in a big hurry about getting here , weren 't you ?
- Maybe this kind of work ain 't to your liking .
- Joe 's all right .
He 's in with us .
Yeah , I 'm in with you .
Well , let 's see , now .
Here 's the way I dope this thing out .
I , Sam Vettori , not you , Rico , or nobody else .
- That 's plain , ain 't it ?
- Sure .
Only , who stands here ?
You kind of forgot that , didn 't you ?
Hey , I 'm boss on this job , not you .
Right here .
Smart guy , Rico .
He 's got plenty of brains .
I tell you , I 'm afraid , Otero .
I 'm afraid .
You 're crazy .
Rico 's coming with us .
Come on now , buck up .
And you , Joe .
You 'll be in the lobby and give us the high sign if everything 's on the up and up .
You get me ?
Yeah , and if we get in a jam , you 'll have to take a chance with the rest of us .
Hey , quiet , quiet .
Holy Moses , it 's Alvin McClure .
The crime commission buzzard .
Hey , DeVoss .
Come here .
What is it , Arnie ?
What is it ?
Bring McClure over here , I want to buy him a lemonade .
- Not tonight , some other time .
- Go on .
Do as you 're told .
Go on , De Voss , bring him here .
As you wish .
What can I order for you ?
- Good evening , Mr. McClure .
- Good evening , DeVoss .
- Quite a party .
- Thank you .
Delighted to have you with us , folks .
Mr. McClure , a Mr. Lorch , a financial backer of mine would like to meet you .
- May I bring him over to your table ?
- Lorch ?
Lorch ?
- You mean the man they call Little Arnie ?
- Yes , but ...
- You say he 's a financial backer of yours ?
- Yes , but ...
I didn 't understand that a man of his type was connected with this place .
I 'm sorry , DeVoss , but you might inform Mr. Lorch that we 're leaving .
I came to this place under a misapprehension .
- Now , Mr. McClure ...
- I 'm sorry , folks but we 'll have to go somewhere else .
You like my hair this way , Joey ?
Sure .
I used to wear it ...
Where are you going ?
- Just to get a package of cigarettes .
- Hurry back , darling , it 's almost 12 : 00 and I wanna be with you for New Year 's .
I 'll be back in a minute .
- What can I get you ?
- A Victor Noble .
Stay where you are .
Oh , help !
Oh , God !
Open her up , Tony , this ain 't no picnic .
What 's the matter , Tony , losing your nerve ?
Come on , let 's go .
Let 's go , we gotta get out of here .
Come on .
Happy New Year .
Why , Joe ...
Joey .
What is it ?
What 's the matter ?
Nothing .
It 's all right .
- The joint 's been held up , that 's all .
- Held up ?
They ...
- They shot McClure .
- Joe .
- Now you know .
- It was you .
- No .
No , it 's a lie !
I ... - You shot McClure .
No , I didn 't , I swear .
It wasn 't me that shot him .
It was ...
I don 't know who .
But it 's our hips for this job , all right .
Maybe ...
Maybe everything will be all right , Joey .
Maybe he wasn 't hurt badly .
But you 're through with that bunch .
You don 't belong , Joe .
You 're not that kind .
You 'll never go near them again .
Olga you can 't go back on a gang .
Well , everything come off all right ?
Tell me .
Everything was all right .
Only I had to take care of a guy .
- Who was it ?
- McClure .
McClure .
You shot McClure .
A million guys in this town , and you had to pick the crime commissioner .
What did I tell you , Rico ?
Didn 't I say to make it clean ?
Didn 't I say no gunplay ?
Think I 'm going to let a guy pull a gat on me ?
Any more of these cracks , and this is my last job .
The head of the crime commission .
The Big Boy can 't do us no good this trip .
They 'll get us dead sure now .
- What am I gonna do ?
- Why don 't you go and give yourself up ?
You 're slipping , Sam .
And Tony , what about him ?
Where is he ?
Getting rid of the car .
Tony got nervous .
He 's like a big baby .
What a fine pickle we 're in .
You and that rod of yours .
Flaherty 's downstairs , a couple of dicks with him .
They 're coming right up .
Stay where you are , all of you .
They won 't know nothing unless they picked Tony up .
Give them the shaft .
I 'll be in here listening .
Happy New Year , boys .
Say , there 's a lonesome touring car down the street .
I was wondering if you happened to know anything about it .
How should I know anything about it ?
- Ain 't it got license plates on it ?
- Yes , but they 're phony .
It was stolen on the north side tonight .
Oh , I got a good café business .
I don 't know nothing about automobiles what 's been stolen .
Well , you might if some of the bright young men around here had anything to do with it , wouldn 't you ?
- Wasn 't there anybody in it ?
- Yes , one guy .
But not when we got there . He beat it .
But we got a good description of him , though .
I 'm telling you , I don 't know nothing about it .
Well , come on , fellas .
As long as Vettori doesn 't know anything about it .
Oh , say , have you heard the news , Vettori ?
No , what ?
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure over at the Bronze Peacock .
McClure ?
No , that 's terrible .
Some guys are sure careless with the lead , all right .
What a tough break for Arnie .
It 's gonna be a tough break for a lot of birds .
Well , so long .
Oh , I forgot to wish you fellas a merry Christmas .
Tony , I can 't figure him .
The kid 's a great driver .
- Oh , he must 've lost his nerve .
- I 'll take care of him .
- Let 's see the color of that money .
- Just a minute , Sam .
I got my own ideas of a split .
And you can take it or leave it .
- We ain 't begging you .
- Yeah , well I bossed this job and I 'm gonna get my split .
How 'd you boss this job ?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire ?
Well , that don 't go no more , not with me .
We 're done .
- I 've been taking orders from you too long .
- You 'll keep on taking orders too or you 'll get out of here so fast ...
- Maybe it won 't be me that gets out .
No ?
Well , maybe the boys have got something to say about that .
What about it ?
So , that 's it , huh ?
Yeah , that 's it , all right .
You can dish it out , but you 're getting so you can 't take it no more .
You 're through .
Well ?
Well , the split 's okay with me , Rico .
How about you boys ?
No hard feelings , Sam ?
We gotta stick together .
There 's a rope around my neck right now , and they only hang you once .
If anybody turns yellow and squeals my gun 's gonna speak its peace .
What 's the matter , Antonio ?
Why you don 't sleep ?
- You sick , maybe ?
- Yeah .
- Oh , what ...
- No , can 't a guy get up when he wants to without answering a lot of questions ?
You stay out late nights , you drink lot of wine .
- Leave me alone .
- Oh , listen , Antonio , I ...
I have some spaghetti for you on the stove .
If you feel better , eat some .
Yes ?
It do you good .
You used to be a good boy , Antonio .
Remember when you sing in the church ?
In the choir with Father McNeil ?
You in white .
Remember ?
Father McNeil .
The church was beautiful .
You little boy with long hair .
The tall , big candles .
Flowers .
Remember , Antonio ?
Don 't leave me , Ma , do you hear ?
You don 't have to go now , do you ?
Can 't you stay a little while with me ?
Please , don 't go away .
- Please .
- Oh , Antonio .
Oh , my baby .
I no go , I stay .
Antonio .
Oh , my boy .
I 'll be all right , Ma .
- You 'd better run along , do you hear ?
- Yes .
You run along .
Take good care of yourself , will you ?
And give my love to Miss Manccia , will you ?
Father McNeil .
Hey , Tony .
Where you been ?
I 'm looking all over for you .
Rico wants you to come and get your split .
What 's the matter , Tony ?
Don 't you want a split ?
Are you crazy ?
I 'm not crazy .
And I don 't want no split .
Listen , Tony .
Rico knows you lose your nerve .
Now , he wants you to be a man .
You better not turn yellow .
Get away from me , Otero .
Leave me alone !
Listen , kid .
I 'm trying to tell you for your own good .
Come with me and get your split .
Hey , Tony !
Tony , where you going ?
I 'm going to see Father McNeil .
Rico !
I found Tony , but it 's too late .
He 's crazy !
Crazy !
I tell him to be a man , but he shakes his head and goes to the priest .
Well , I guess that 's that .
We ain 't got any time to lose .
Come on , Sam , get a car , and let 's go .
Not me ! Take ...
Take Scabby .
- Scabby 's no good .
- No . I 'm not .
- Can you drive , Otero ?
- Sure !
All right , let 's go .
We 'll use the black roadster .
There he is .
Tony !
Did you see all them wreaths ?
That hearse is sure decked out pretty .
Well , this was no time to be tight with money .
Tony deserved a swell send-off .
- Poor kid .
- Yeah , but Rico 's wreath beat them all .
It was big .
And all it had on it was " Tony . "
- Not even Rico 's name .
- Yeah .
Rico 's no braggart .
Tony looked like he was asleep .
Didn 't look a bit changed .
Beats me how they do it .
Got a match ?
Look , Rico .
There 's Flaherty , the bull .
Things must be getting pretty hot .
What 's he want ?
He 's just stalling .
They ain 't got a thing on me .
Gee , we 're moving slow .
We got plenty of time .
The banquet won 't start until 8 .
Yeah .
Too bad Tony won 't be there .
Yeah , that 's the goods , all right .
That 's the fanciest I 've ever seen , Sam .
Look at those little turtledoves down here .
Friendship and loyalty , huh ?
- Well , how do you like that , Sam ?
- Pretty good , Rico .
Otero told me I don 't look good in a derby .
What do you think ?
- Looks just like you .
- I thought so .
I guess I 'll stick to them from now on .
" Compliments to a true pal .
Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal Mr. Sam Vettori . " Well , that 's nice .
I appreciate , Sam .
That 's swell of you .
What 's the matter with you birds ?
Don 't you know how to act at a banquet ?
What do you think you are , a lot of gashouse yaps ?
Well , cut the chatter .
Scabby 's gonna make a speech .
Well , folks you all know what we 're here for so what 's the good of me telling you all about it ?
Rico here is a great guy !
Sure , and ...
Well ...
Say , Rico I don 't know how to talk fancy , but ...
This here watch is for you , see ?
- From the boys !
- Come on , everybody . Clap , like .
Speech !
Oh , no , no , no .
- Speech !
- Oh , well .
All right .
You birds want me to make a speech ?
Here it goes .
I ... I want to thank you , fellas , for this here banquet .
It sure is swell .
The liquor is good , so they tell me .
But I don 't drink it , myself .
And the food don 't leave nothing to be desired .
Well , I guess we 're all having a swell time and it sure is good to see all you gents with your molls here .
Yeah .
Well , I ...
I guess that 's about all .
And I wish you birds wouldn 't get drunk and raise Cain because that 's the way a lot of birds get bumped off .
Yeah .
Lay off that stuff .
I know what I 'm ...
A couple of newspaper guys out there want to take a picture .
What do you say , boss ?
Well , what do you think of that , huh ?
Sure .
Send them in .
Tell them to make it snappy .
- I 'll see you later .
- Oh , don 't go away .
- We 're going to have our pictures taken .
Well , what do you think of that ?
15 years , he hasn 't ...
Come on , boys , make it snappy .
Come on , now !
Quiet , everybody !
We 're gonna get mugged !
There you are .
Now , hold it .
Hold it , still !
- Look at the guys over there .
- That was a bad play you made then , Rico .
That flashlight .
- They might pick you up on that .
- Well , what do I care ?
Don 't I want folks to see what the boys think of me ?
Hey , Rico , what become of that pal of yours , that dancer guy , Joe Massara ?
He didn 't come .
He ain 't been around in a long time .
He didn 't quit on you , did he , Rico ?
Bad business to quit on me , Sam .
One guy tried that on me once .
Now , you mind your own business and let me tend to my own .
What does that bull want in here ?
- I 'll show him where he gets off .
- Careful , Rico .
Who invited you here ?
You 're getting up in the world , aren 't you , Rico ?
The downstairs is open to anybody , even cops .
But the upstairs is private .
Thanks , but I like to keep my eye on you , Rico .
You see , I 'm your friend .
I like to see a young fellow getting up in the world that 's all .
So long .
Hurry back .
I will .
Oh , say ...
Somebody threw a brick through Meyer Blum 's window last night .
Do you happen to know anything about a diamond-and-platinum watch that was stolen , do you ?
If you hear anything about it , let me know , won 't you ?
Banquet , eh ?
Rico got far too far .
So now , he 's got to stop .
I 'm saying he 's got to stop !
Oh , Arnie , are you fellas going to start another scrap ?
What 's the use of my paying heavy dues for protection if there 's no peace ?
- Don 't worry .
There 'll be peace soon enough .
I 'm saying he 's got to stop , so he 's gonna stop .
He 's been cutting in on my territory and that 's all wet with me .
Look .
I 'm sitting here , see ?
I 'm sitting here quiet smoking a cigarette , see ?
But a couple of my boys ain 't sitting here .
They 're out looking for Rico , and they got their gats with them too .
Catch on ?
And when they find him , it won 't be no banquet that Rico gets .
It will be a wake !
Arnie , you know best .
I 've never met Rico .
Phelps , 2284 .
Hello , Otero .
This is Joe Massara .
I just found out something . This is hot .
Tell Rico to look out .
Little Arnie 's gang is out to put one in him .
What 's the matter ?
- Where is Rico ?
- You got me .
He ain 't showed up yet .
Come on , quick !
We got to find him !
I want 10 of these .
Gee , you taking all these papers , Mr. Rico ?
Why , sure .
Ain 't I got my picture in them ?
Here .
- Thanks !
Come again !
- That 's all right .
Fine shots you are !
Oh , no !
So somebody finally put one in you .
Yeah , but they just grazed me .
The old man will be glad to hear it .
He takes such an interest in you .
Tell him the cops couldn 't get me no other way , so they hired a couple of gunmen .
If I wasn 't on the force , I 'd have done the job cheap .
Did you ever think how you 'd look with a lily in your hand ?
No , I never did .
I 've been in this game a good many years , and I put the cuffs on a lot of mugs .
Someday , you and I are gonna take a ride , Rico and when we do , I 'll have the cuffs on you too .
No buzzard like you will ever put any cuffs on Rico .
Come on , boys .
I 'm gonna get that swell-headed mug if it 's the last thing I ever do .
Boss , I 'm sorry .
I should have been with you .
They thought they hit the target , boss , but bullets just bounce off of you .
It was Little Arnie , Rico .
Joe Massara got the tip , and he called up .
We couldn 't find you in time .
Joe , huh ?
Well .
I didn 't think he cared enough .
Well , that was white of him , all right .
I ought to give him a chance on my next job .
There .
Guess I didn 't study medicine for nothing , did I ?
Thanks , Scabby .
I 'm going to see Little Arnie tonight .
If he 's looking for trouble , why , that 's what we got the most of .
I want Killer Peppi , Otero , Kid Bean and Bat to go with me .
Listen , handsome , open up , or you 'll tell nobody nothing no more .
Tell him we 're all right , and don 't act nervous .
These fellas are all right .
Come on , stick them up .
Lock that door .
Where 's Arnie ?
In the office ?
Bat , stay outside that door and don 't let anybody in .
Kid , you keep them covered .
Peppi and Otero , follow me .
Come on , you .
Give him the knock .
Come on !
Put them up !
Put them up !
Come on !
Hello , Arnie .
- How 's business ?
- What 's the game ?
I don 't know what this is all about , but it 's a private row .
- You guys better beat it .
- Ain 't nobody gonna leave this room .
You guys are invited to this private party .
Suppose we don 't want to stay ?
I wouldn 't stop you for the world .
Only these boys of mine have itching fingers .
Sit down , gents .
Arnie you ought to have better sense than to hire a couple of outside yaps especially bad shots .
Come on .
What is it ?
Let 's have it !
Arnie you 're through .
You hire these mugs , they miss .
Now you 're through .
If you ain 't out of town by tomorrow morning you won 't ever leave it except in a pine box .
I 'm taking over this territory .
From now on , it 's mine .
You 're growing , Rico .
So this is what you 've been after all the time ?
I seen it in your eyes the first time I met you .
You 're no good , Rico .
If you think you can muscle in on me like you did on Sam Vettori , you 're off your nut !
I suppose you forgot all about Pete Montana , huh ?
How 's Diamond Pete going to stop me ?
He may be your boss , but he ain 't mine .
Sam didn 't feel that way about him .
- Sam knew who gave orders .
- Sam was too soft .
Diamond Pete could scare him , but I ain 't no Sam .
Sam is through .
Now you 're through too .
Nice stickpin you got there , Arnie .
Nothing phony about my jewelry .
Arnie you better quit this racket .
You can dish it out , but you got so that you can 't take it no more .
You 'd better take your hats and beat it .
The first thing you know , you 'll be arrested for firing a rod in the city limits .
Well I guess that 's about all .
Pleasant trip , gents .
Come on , boys .
Oh , thanks , boys , for the artillery .
- Well , boys .
What do you think of it ?
- Scabby , you 're in the wrong job .
It 's perfect .
That means you have a new partner .
Little Caesar .
Everybody 'll laugh at Scabby 's story .
Gee , boss .
You gave Arnie an awful walloping .
Rico ...
Now you 're famous .
You see , Otero .
There ain 't no use in being scared of any of these big guys .
The bigger they come , the harder they fall .
Yeah .
I ain 't doing so bad in this business so far .
Well , now .
You look great , boss .
Yeah , but it feels terrible .
You 're getting up in the world , Rico .
None of us ever been invited up to eat at the Big Boy 's dump .
And nobody ever crashed the gate except Pete Montana .
See what I mean ?
Now , you don 't want the Big Boy to think you ain 't got no class .
They rig you up better than this in the stir .
If you think I 'm going out in this , you 're crazy !
You look fine , boss .
- Go on .
Take a peek at yourself .
- Oh , I don 't know .
All I need is a napkin over my arm .
Now , don 't you look fine ?
Yeah .
I guess maybe I don 't look so bad after all .
Oh , hello .
- Hello , Big Boy .
- Hello , Rico .
Oh , yeah .
Yeah .
Thanks .
Thanks very much .
Well , you 're rather lit up tonight , aren 't you ?
Yeah .
I thought I better put on a monkey suit .
That 's right .
You may as well learn now .
Yeah .
Well ...
Some joint you got here .
It 'll do .
I bet all this trick furniture set you back plenty , huh ?
Well , they don 't exactly give it away with cigar coupons .
Well , I 'll tell the world .
Boy , it sure look ...
Oh , look at that .
- Do you like it ?
- Oh , I think it 's elegant .
That cost me $ 15,000 .
Fifteen thou ...
Boy , them gold frames sure cost plenty of dough .
Well , will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy ?
Oh , no , thanks .
I never touch the stuff .
No ?
- Cigar , then ?
- Oh , yeah .
I 'll have one of those .
Thanks .
Thanks very much .
- Sit down , Rico .
- Yeah .
Thanks .
Now , listen , Rico .
I 'm gonna talk to you , but you 're not gonna hear a word I say , see ?
This is inside dope , and if it gets out , it 'll be just too bad for somebody .
You know me .
All right .
Get this .
Pete Montana 's through .
Yeah ?
Well .
- And I thought he was such a big guy .
- He 's through .
Suppose I were to tell you that from now on you were Pete Montana .
That you were to take over his territory in addition to your own .
Would you shake on it ?
Would I ?
Would I ?
All right .
It 's set .
I 'm doing a lot for you , Rico , but when I get you planted I 'll expect plenty of service .
Well , you 'll sure get it .
Permit me , then , to drink to the new boss of the North Side .
Thank you .
Otero , what did I tell you , huh ?
I knew it was coming .
I knew he had his eyes on me all the time .
And let me tell you something , Otero .
It 's not only Pete Montana that 's through , but the Big Boy himself .
He ain 't what he used to be .
Pretty soon , he won 't be able to take it , and then watch me .
Sure , boss .
Pretty soon , you 'll be running the whole town .
Otero , you said a mouthful .
There 's a guy by the name of Massara out there .
He wants to see you , sir .
- I 'll see him in a minute .
- Yes , sir .
What 's Joe want here ?
He hasn 't been near any of us for months .
I sent for him .
I heard somebody in Detroit got to Flaherty and told him to start working on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock if he wanted to find out who shot McClure .
Gee , boss , you 're wise to everything before it happens .
Yeah , I don 't miss much .
I 'll soon find out if Flaherty 's been working on Joe after I have a little talk with him .
Gee , Rico , what a palace .
Oh , hello , Joe .
Yeah , it 'll do .
But what do you expect ?
Ain 't I got 20 grand tied up in it ?
- Hello , Otero .
How are you , baby ?
- First-rate .
Sit down , Joe .
Sure I 'm good enough to sit in such a swell chair ?
Come on , now .
Cut the comedy .
Sit down .
Screw , Otero .
- I want to talk with Joe private .
- Sure .
See you later , Joe .
- Cigar , Joe ?
- No , thanks .
Well , will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy ?
No .
Well , it surprise you to hear from me ?
Kind of .
I thought it would be kind of nice to have a little talk together like old times .
Certainly is nice to see you , Rico .
Especially like this .
- You 're looking good .
- You 're looking good too , Joe .
Living easy , kind of , huh ?
- Not that easy .
Dancing 's no cinch .
- Yeah , but you ain 't complaining .
- No .
No , I ain 't complaining .
- That 's good .
Yeah .
Dancing 's all right for a sideline .
It gives you a swell front .
But it ain 't my idea of a man 's game .
What 's the difference , Rico ?
As long as I ain 't kicking , why should you kick ?
Who 's kicking ?
Only why should a young guy like you be wasting his time ?
And I kind of took pride in you , Joe brought you into the gang , pushed you ahead .
But now you 're getting to be a sissy .
We got to go into that again ?
Can 't you just forget about me ?
I don 't want to forget , Joe . You 're my pal .
We started off together , didn 't we ?
We 've got to keep going along together .
Who else do I got to give a hang about ?
I need you , Joe .
I 've got the biggest chance of my life .
The Big Boy just handed me the whole North Side but it 's too much for one man to handle alone .
I need somebody , a guy like you somebody I can trust .
- Can 't be me , Rico .
I 've quit .
You didn 't quit .
Nobody ever quit me .
You 're still in my gang , you got that ?
I don 't care how many fancy skirts you 've got hanging on to you .
That jane 's made a softy out of you .
- You lay off Olga .
- I ain 't laying off .
I 'm after her !
One of us has to lose , and it won 't be me .
There 's ways of stopping that dame .
- You 're crazy .
Leave her out of this !
- She 's through , out of the way .
- You 're lying .
You wouldn 't dare !
- I wouldn 't ?
- I 'll show you !
- Rico , listen .
We 're in love with one another .
Don 't that mean nothing ?
Nothing .
Less than nothing .
Love .
Soft stuff !
When she 's got you , you ain 't no good for anything .
We ain 't out of this yet and we don 't want no softies spilling things !
I won 't spill anything , if you 're scared of that .
- You think I want my neck stretched ?
- Well , you know too much .
I ain 't gonna take any chances .
You 're hanging around with me , see ?
No , I 'm not .
All right .
You go back to that dame and it 's suicide .
Suicide for both of you .
Just stick here .
Hello ?
Oh , hello , Big Boy .
No .
No , I don 't want that guy .
I don 't trust him .
Yeah .
I got a kid by the name of Joe Massara who 'll help me .
Yeah .
All right , goodbye , Big Boy .
Oh , Joe ...
- Joe .
- Olga .
- We 've gotta go .
Hurry !
- Joe , what 's the matter ?
Didn 't you hear what I said ? Hurry !
Hurry !
- Yes , Joe .
Oh , you 're ill .
- I 'm all right .
- Rico .
- What did he do to you ?
Oh , didn 't I know it ?
He , Rico ...
He said you and me got to quit .
He 'd kill you unless I stuck with him .
I ran away .
We 've got to get out of here .
Anywhere .
As long as we get away !
No .
- No ?
You 're not coming ?
- No .
That 's not the way .
But , Olga , you don 't know that guy !
- Olga , you 've got to !
Please !
- No .
Sit down , Joe .
- We 've got to think .
- I don 't want to think or sit down .
- You 're coming .
- Don 't you see ?
It would be no use !
Where ?
Where would we go ?
Where would we run to ?
There 's no place he wouldn 't find us .
There 's only one thing for us to do .
Flaherty .
You 're crazy .
You think that would save us ?
Flaherty ?
That 's worse than suicide .
- I won 't do it .
I can 't .
- Well , I can do it .
That gang must go .
Rico must go .
I want my happiness , Joe .
I want you .
We 'll never have peace till Rico 's gone .
I 'm going to do it .
Olga , don 't !
Please !
Stay here !
Olga , open this door !
Olga , open this door !
Hurry !
Park , 1000 .
Olga .
Don 't call Flaherty .
Please , open this door , quickly !
Rico will kill us both !
Headquarters , I want Sergeant Flaherty .
Sergeant Flaherty , this is Olga Stassoff .
I 've got Joe Massara with me .
In my apartment .
17 Edsel Drive .
Yes .
Yes , he wants to talk to you .
Hurry , hurry !
Come on , boys , we 're going to a party .
Who 's giving the party ?
- Joe Massara .
- Formal or informal ?
I don 't know , but we 'll find out when we get there .
You shouldn 't have done it .
You shouldn 't have .
There was no other way .
No other right way .
- It 's the rope for me .
- No , it isn 't .
Not if you turn state 's evidence .
We 'll make them promise everything will be okay .
Wait , Olga !
- Joe !
- There he is , the dirty double-crosser .
Give it to him , Rico !
No .
Shoot .
Shoot , Rico .
Get it over with .
Come on , Otero !
Let 's go !
You 're getting soft too .
What 's the matter with you ?
Come on !
Joe .
- Who was it ?
- Otero ! He and Rico .
Through the window !
Go on , boys .
Go and get him !
Are you ready to talk now , Joe ?
Well , I 'll talk .
It was Rico 's gang that held up the Bronze Peacock .
It was Rico who shot McClure .
That dirty , low , sneaking ...
Well , Joe will tell you .
He knows it was Rico .
Is that right , Joe ?
Was it Rico ?
- Where 's your phone ?
- In there .
Oh , Joe .
Here , let me help you .
Park , 1000 .
Hello , Dan , this is Flaherty .
Round up that Palermo gang .
I got enough on them to use a mile of rope .
Shoot the cars right out , and above all , get Rico .
We 've gotta watch our step .
The cops are sure to be cruising around .
- You should have plugged Joe .
- And the dame .
If they ain 't squealed about McClure yet , they 'll do it now .
- From now on , we 're hot .
- Yeah .
This is what I get for liking a guy too much .
Come on .
Halt !
Halt !
Go on , Rico .
I 'm done for .
Go on , Rico .
Sam !
Sam !
Joe Massara !
They nabbed him over the McClure business , and he squawked .
Rico tried to get him .
Now they 're after him .
They got Otero .
- Otero ?
- Sam , don 't you get me ?
- What are you sitting there for ?
- What else can I do ?
I can 't run now .
They 'd get me anyhow .
You 're out of your head .
Come on , get up .
Let 's beat it !
It 's no use .
Put them up !
Don 't move !
Hand over your guns .
All right .
Take them down to the car .
You 'd better give up , Sam .
Drop that gun before we start shooting .
Come on in .
Get on your feet and put your hands up .
Put the cuffs on him .
You ain 't got nothing on me .
Nothing but the bracelets .
And we haven 't got a thing on Rico , either .
He 's next .
- There 's nobody in there .
- No ?
Well , listen , Ma .
If you see Rico , you 'd better let us know , quick .
Well you got yourself in a nice fix .
- Yeah .
- The cops were just here .
They got Otero .
Ma , I 'm gonna stay here a day or two , then I want a car .
Gonna cost you big , because I 'm taking big chances .
I got 10 grand planted here .
Help yourself .
When you 're ready to start , I 'll give you $ 150 .
You 'll give me ?
Whose money is this ?
Who do you think you 're talking to ?
I need plenty .
My money is hidden in the apartment .
I can 't get to it .
I 'll give you $ 150 .
Take it or leave it .
Why , you dirty , thieving old hag , I 'll ...
No , you won 't .
Because I 'm the only one knows where the money 's hid .
Kill me , and you won 't get a cent .
I 'll give you $ 150 if you 'll be a good boy .
He was mean , Sam Vettori was .
So now he 's got what was coming to him .
What does it say in the paper ?
" Former gang chief faints on scaffold .
After a futile battle in the courts Sam Vettori , former gang leader today presented a pitiful figure as the hangman 's noose was placed around his neck . "
Listen . " Little Caesar has never been found .
According to the statement of Lieutenant Thomas Flaherty of the homicide squad Little Caesar , the once swaggering braggart of the underworld wilted in the face of real danger and showed the world his cowardice .
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar has contradicted his oft-repeated boast that he could dish it out and take it too . "
Yeah .
" When a real crisis arose Rico couldn 't take it .
Flaherty ended his interview by remarking :
'Meteoric as was Rico 's rise from the gutter it was inevitable that he should return there . " '
Well , just the same , he was the real leader of that gang .
Don 't you believe it .
Rico didn 't have the nerve , and he didn 't have the brains .
He was yellow , just like Flaherty said .
Here !
- That 's what Rico ...
- Give me that paper !
Hey , watch it !
- What 's the matter with him ?
- Must be crazy .
I 'll show them where they get off .
Trying to put that kind of stuff about me in the papers , huh ?
I 'll show them ...
Hello ?
Hello ?
I want Park , 1000 .
Yeah .
Yeah , I can 't take it no more , huh ?
I 'll tell that guy where to ...
Hello ?
Park , 1000 ?
- Get me Flaherty , and get him quick .
- Sure .
Just a minute .
Tom . Oh , Tom .
I may be screwy , but this sounds like Rico .
Yeah ?
- Flaherty speaking .
- Yeah , this is Rico speaking !
Rico !
R-l-C-O , Rico !
Little Caesar , that 's who !
You 're a big guy , ain 't you ?
Shooting your mouth off in the papers .
So I ran out when it got hot , huh ? I can 't take it no more ?
Well , listen , you crummy , flatfooted copper I 'll show you whether I lost my nerve .
Thanks , Rico , old boy .
The same to you and many of them .
Come on , tell me some more .
The sound of your voice does my heart good .
Trace that call .
Find out where he 's phoning from , quick .
Say , why didn 't you come to Sam 's neck-stretching party , Rico ?
It was a big success .
Funny guy , ain 't you , Flaherty ?
Well , you ain 't got much longer to laugh .
I 'm coming , and I 'm gonna put one in your dirty hide for every lying crack that you made about me , see ?
I 'll show you who 's gonna finish up in the gutter .
We 've missed you , Rico .
The town has been nice and quiet .
I 'm putting on weight .
River , 6547 .
It 's a flophouse down at 4th and Commercial .
All right .
All right , big mouth .
Get your hat and start running , see , because you 're all through .
Call the papers and tell them that , you rotten , dirty , lying copper !
I knew we 'd hear from that guy if I kept giving it to him in the papers .
The conceit of that guy !
They 'll have to build a special noose to get that swelled head of his through .
Well , wish me luck .
There he is .
That 's Rico , all right .
Pull in there .
You 'd better give up , Rico .
You haven 't got a chance .
You 'll have to come and get me .
You 'd better be a nice boy , Rico , and come out .
You heard me !
If you want me , come and get me !
I 'll be with you in a minute .
Give me that chopper .
This is your last chance , Rico .
Are you coming out , or do you want to be carried out ?
Well , Rico , it looks like you and I are going to take that little ride together .
No ...
No , we ain 't .
I told you a little buzzard like you will never put any cuffs on me .
You should have come out when I told you to , Rico .
Mother of mercy .
Is this the end of Rico ?

THE END
" Among the rugged peaks that frown down upon the Borgo Pass " are found crumbling castles of a bygone age . "
I say , driver , a bit slower .
No , no !
We must reach the inn before sundown .
And why , pray ?
It is Walpurgis Night , the night of evil .
Nosferatu .
On this night , madam , the doors , they are barred and to the Virgin we pray .
I say , porter .
Don 't take my luggage down .
I 'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight .
No , no , please .
Put that back up there .
The driver , he is afraid .
Walpurgis Night .
Good fellow , he is .
He wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise .
Well , I 'm sorry , but there 's a carriage meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight .
Borgo Pass ?
Yes . Whose carriage ?
Count Dracula 's .
Count Dracula 's ?
Yes .
Castle Dracula ?
Yes , that 's where I 'm going .
To the castle ?
Yes .
No .
You mustn 't go there .
We people of the mountains believe at the castle there are vampires !
Dracula and his wives .
They take the form of wolves and bats .
They leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living .
Oh , but that 's all superstition .
Why , I can 't understand why ...
Look , the sun .
When it is gone , they leave their coffins .
Come .
We must go indoors .
But wait !
I mean , just a minute , I ...
What I 'm trying to say is that I 'm not afraid .
I 've explained to the driver that it 's a matter of business with me .
I 've got to go .
Really .
Well , good night .
Wait .
Please .
If you must go , wear this , for your mother 's sake .
It will protect you .
The coach from Count Dracula ?
Hey , driver !
I say , driver , what do you mean by going at this ...
I am Dracula .
It 's really good to see you .
I don 't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and ...
Well , and with all this , I thought I was in the wrong place .
I bid you welcome .
Listen to them .
Children of the night .
What music they make .
The spider spinning his web for the unwary fly .
The blood is the life , Mr. Renfield .
Why ...
Yes .
I 'm sure you will find this part of my castle more inviting .
Well , rather .
It 's quite different from outside .
Oh , and the fire , it 's so cheerful .
I didn 't know , but that you might be hungry .
Thank you . That 's very kind of you , but I 'm a bit worried about my luggage .
You see , all your papers were in ...
I took the liberty of having your luggage brought up .
Allow me . Oh , yes .
Thanks .
I trust you have kept your coming here a secret .
I 've followed your instructions implicitly .
Excellent , Mr. Renfield .
Excellent .
And now , if you 're not too fatigued , I would like to discuss the lease on Carfax Abbey .
Oh , yes .
Everything is in order awaiting your signature .
Well , here .
Here 's the lease .
Why , I hope I 've brought enough labels for your luggage .
I 'm taking with me only three boxes .
Very well .
I have chartered a ship to take us to England .
We will be leaving tomorrow evening .
Everything will be ready .
I hope you will find this comfortable .
Thanks .
It looks very inviting . Ouch !
Oh , it 's nothing serious .
Just a small cut from that paper clip .
It 's just a scratch .
This is very old wine .
I hope you will like it .
Aren 't you drinking ?
I never drink wine .
Well ...
It 's delicious .
And now I 'll leave you .
Well , good night .
Good night , Mr. Renfield .
Master , the sun is gone !
You will keep your promise when we get to London , won 't you , Master ?
You will see that I get lives ?
Not human lives , but small ones with blood in them .
I 'll be loyal to you , Master .
I 'll be loyal !
Must be a Scandinavian ship . That 's what it looks to me like .
Here now , here now , get back .
Nobody goes aboard this here boat but the authorities .
The captain dead , tied to the wheel .
Horrible tragedy , horrible tragedy .
Master , we 're here !
You can 't hear what I 'm saying , but we 're here !
We 're safe !
They must have come through a terrible storm .
What 's that ?
Why , it 's come from that hatchway !
Why , he 's mad !
Look at his eyes .
Why , the man 's gone crazy .
Violets !
Violets ! Flower for your buttonhole , sir .
Flower for your buttonhole , sir . Flower for your buttonhole , sir .
Flower for your buttonhole .
Here 's a nice one .
And after you deliver the message , you will remember nothing I now say .
Obey .
Dr. Seward ? Yes ?
You 're wanted on the telephone .
Thank you .
Well , excuse me , dear .
Oh , Father , if it 's from home , will you say I 'm spending the night in town with Lucy ?
All right , dear . Pardon me .
Yes ?
I could not help overhearing your name .
Might I inquire if you are the Dr. Seward whose sanitarium is at Whitby ?
Why , yes .
I 'm Count Dracula .
I have just leased Carfax Abbey .
I understand it adjoins your grounds .
Why , yes , it does .
I 'm very happy to make your acquaintance .
May I present my daughter Mina ? Count Dracula .
Miss Weston .
How do you do ?
And Mr. Harker .
How do you do ?
Count Dracula 's just taken Carfax Abbey .
Oh , it 'll be a relief to see light in those dismal old windows .
It will , indeed .
You 'll excuse me , I 'm wanted on the telephone .
The Abbey could be very attractive , but I should imagine it would need quite extensive repairs .
I shall do very little repairing .
It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania .
The Abbey always reminds me of that old toast about lofty timbers .
" The walls around are bare , " echoing to our laughter " as though the dead were there . "
Nice little sentiment .
But there 's more , even nicer .
" Pass a cup to the dead already , " a round for the next to die ... "
Oh , never mind the rest , dear .
To die , to be really dead , that must be glorious .
Why , Count Dracula !
There are far worse things awaiting man than death .
It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in Transylvania . Oh , Lucy .
You 're so romantic .
Laugh all you like .
I think he 's fascinating .
I suppose he 's all right .
But give me someone a little more normal .
Like John ?
Yes , dear , like John . Castle .
Dracula ! Transylvania .
Well , Countess ,
I 'll leave you to your Count and his ruined abbey .
Good night , Lucy . Good night , dear .
The fog seems to be closing down a bit , sir .
Another death . Dead .
Dr. Seward , when did Miss Weston have the last transfusion ? About four hours ago .
An unnatural loss of blood , which we 've been powerless to check .
On the throat of each victim , the same two marks .
He probably wants his flies again ! No , Martin , please !
Please don 't , Martin !
Oh , Martin , please !
Please , Martin !
No , Martin !
Oh , Martin , please !
Here , give it to me now !
No , no , no , Martin ! Please ! No , Martin !
Martin , don 't !
Don 't throw my spider away from me .
Oh , Martin . No .
Ain 't you ashamed now ? Ain 't you ? Spiders now , is it ?
Flies ain 't good enough ?
Flies ?
Flies ?
Poor , puny things .
Who wants to eat flies ?
You do , you loony .
Not when I can get nice , fat spiders !
All right . Have it your own way .
Read , dummkopf , where I have marked .
Gentlemen , we are dealing with the undead . Nosferatu ?
Yes , Nosferatu , the undead , the vampire .
The vampire attacks the throat .
It leaves two little wounds , white with red centers .
Dr. Seward , your patient , Renfield , whose blood I have just analyzed , is obsessed with the idea that he must devour living things in order to sustain his own life .
But Professor Van Helsing , modern medical science does not admit of such a creature . The vampire is a pure myth , superstition .
I may be able to bring you proof that the superstition of yesterday can become the scientific reality of today .
But , Professor , Renfield 's cravings have always been for small living things . Nothing human .
As far as we know , Doctor .
But you tell me that he escapes from his room .
He is gone for hours .
Where does he go ?
Well , Mr. Renfield , you are looking much better than you did this morning when I arrived .
Thanks , I 'm feeling much better .
I am here to help you . You understand that , do you not ?
Why , of course .
And I 'm very grateful .
Keep your filthy hands to yourself ! Now , now , Renfield .
Oh , Dr. Seward , send me away from this place . Send me far away .
Why are you so anxious to get away ?
My cries at night , they might disturb Miss Mina . Yes ?
They might give her bad dreams , Professor Van Helsing .
Bad dreams .
That sounded like a wolf . Yes , it did .
But I hardly think there are wolves so near London .
He thinks they 're wolves .
Me , I 've heard them howl at night before .
He thinks they 're talking to him .
He howls and howls back at them .
He 's crazy !
I might have known . I might have known .
We know why the wolves talk , do we not , Mr. Renfield ?
And we know how we can make them stop .
You know too much to live , Van Helsing . Now , now , Renfield .
We 'll get no more out of him now for a while . Take him away , Martin .
On your way , old fly eater .
I 'm warning you , Dr. Seward .
If you don 't send me away , you must answer for what will happen to Miss Mina ! All right , Martin .
Come along , now , come along .
What was that herb that excited him so ?
Wolfsbane .
It is a plant that grows in central Europe .
The natives there use it to protect themselves against vampires .
Renfield reacted very violently to its scent .
Seward , I want you to have Renfield closely watched by day and night , especially by night .
Yes , Master .
Master , you 've come back .
No , Master , please ! Please don 't ask me to do that !
Don 't ! Not her !
Please don 't , Master ! Don 't , please !
Please !
Oh , don 't !
I lay in bed for quite a while , reading . And just as I was commencing to get drowsy ,
I heard dogs howling .
And when the dream came , it seemed the whole room was filled with mist .
It was so thick , I could just see the lamp by the bed , a tiny spark in the fog .
And then I saw two red eyes staring at me , and a white livid face came down out of the mist .
It came closer and closer .
I felt its breath on my face , and then its lips .
Dear , it was only a dream . And then , in the morning , I felt so weak .
It seemed as if all the life had been drained out of me .
Darling , we 're going to forget all about these dreams , think about something cheerful , aren 't we ?
Allow me . Oh , certainly , Professor .
Think for a moment .
Is there anything that might have brought this dream on ?
Doctor , there 's something troubling Mina , something she won 't tell us .
And the face in the dream , you say it seemed to come closer and closer ? The lips touched you ?
Where ? Is there anything the matter with your throat ?
Oh , no , but I ... Permit me .
No , please !
Yes , yes .
How long have you had those little marks ? Marks ?
Please .
Mina , why didn 't you let us know ? Do not excite her .
When , Miss Mina ?
Since the morning after the dream . What could have caused them , Professor ?
Count Dracula !
It 's good to see you back again , Doctor . I heard you have just arrived .
And you , Miss Mina . You 're looking exceptionally ...
Pardon me , Dr. Seward , but I think Miss Mina should go to her room at once .
I don 't believe it 's as important as you seem to think it is .
Excuse me .
Count Dracula , Professor Van Helsing .
A most distinguished scientist whose name we know , even in the wilds of Transylvania .
I had a frightful dream a few nights ago , and I don 't seem to be able to get it out of my mind . I hope you haven 't taken my stories too seriously .
Stories ?
Yes .
In my humble effort to amuse your fiancÃ © e , Mr. Harker ,
I was telling her some rather grim tales of my far-off country .
Why , John !
I can quite understand Mr. Harker 's concern .
I 'm afraid it 's quite serious .
My dear , I 'm sure Count Dracula will excuse you .
You must go to your room as Professor Van Helsing suggests .
Oh , but , really , Father , I 'm feeling quite well . You had better do as your father advises .
Very well .
Good night . John .
May I call later and inquire how you 're feeling ?
Why , yes .
Thank you .
My visit was so ill-timed . Not at all .
On the contrary , it may prove to be most enlightening .
In fact , before you go , you can be of definite service .
Anything I can do .
Gladly .
I stumbled upon a most amazing phenomenon , something so incredible , I mistrust my own judgment . Look .
Dr. Seward , my humble apology . I dislike mirrors .
Van Helsing will explain .
For one who has not lived even a single lifetime , you are a wise man , Van Helsing . Whew .
What on earth caused that ? Did you see the look on his face ?
Like a wild animal ! Wild animal ?
Like a madman !
What 's that running across the lawn ? Looks like a huge dog !
Or a wolf ?
He was afraid we might follow .
Follow ?
Sometimes they take the form of wolves , but generally of bats .
What are you talking about ? Dracula .
But what 's Dracula got to do with wolves and bats ?
Dracula is our vampire .
But surely , Professor ... A vampire casts no reflection in the glass .
That is why Dracula smashed the mirror .
I don 't mean to be rude , but that 's the sort of thing I 'd expect one of the patients here to say .
Yes , and that is what your English doctors would say , your police .
The strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him .
Professor , vampires only exist in ghost stories .
A vampire , Mr. Harker , is a being that lives after its death by drinking the blood of the living .
It must have blood or it dies . Its power lasts only from sunset to sunrise .
During the hours of the day , it must rest in the earth in which it was buried .
But then , if Dracula were a vampire , he 'd have to return every night to Transylvania , and that 's impossible .
Then he must have brought his native soil with him , boxes of it .
Boxes of earth large enough for him to rest in . Renfield ?
What are you doing there ?
Come here .
Did you hear what we were saying ? Yes , I heard something .
Enough .
Be guided by what he says .
It 's your only hope .
I begged you to send me away , but you wouldn 't .
Now it 's too late .
It 's happened again .
What 's happened ?
Take her away from here . Take her away before ...
No , no , Master ! I wasn 't going to say anything !
I told them nothing !
I 'm loyal to you , Master .
What have you to do with Dracula ?
Dracula ?
I never even heard the name before .
You will die in torment if you die with innocent blood on your soul . Oh , no .
God will not damn a lunatic 's soul .
He knows that the powers of evil are too great for those of us with weak minds .
Oh , Mr. Harker !
Mr. Harker , it 's horrible !
Oh , it 's horrible ! Dr. Seward !
Miss Mina , out there dead !
Where ? Where ?
Out there !
Thank heaven for that .
Alive , yes , but in greater danger , for she 's already under his influence . It 's horrible , Van Helsing , horrible !
Incredible . Incredible , perhaps , but a fact .
We must face it . We must cope with it .
" Further attacks on small children committed after dark " by the mysterious woman in white took place last night .
" Narratives of two small girls , each child describing " a beautiful lady in white who promised her chocolates , " enticed her to a secluded spot
Vampires .
And then , Miss Mina ?
Well , how could she know anything about the woman in white ? It 's bad enough for her to read it in the newspaper ...
Please , please , Mr. Harker .
And when was the next time you saw Miss Lucy after she was buried ?
I was downstairs on the terrace . She came out of the shadows and stood looking at me . I started to speak to her .
The most horrible expression came over her face .
She looked like a hungry animal .
A Wolf .
And then she turned and ran back into the dark .
Then you know the woman in white is ... Lucy .
Miss Mina ,
I promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest , her soul released from this horror .
If you can save Lucy 's soul after death , promise me you 'll save mine . Darling , you 're not going to die , you 're going to live .
No , John . You mustn 't touch me .
And you mustn 't kiss me ever again .
What are you trying to say ?
You make him understand .
I can 't .
Our love , our life together .
Oh , no .
No , no , donâ € ™ t look at me like that . I love you , John .
You .
But this horror , he wills it . Miss Mina , you must come indoors .
You must .
You 're driving her crazy !
Mr. Harker , that is what you should be worrying about .
The last rays of the day 's sun will soon be gone , and another night will be upon us .
Dr. Seward , I 'm taking Mina with me to London tonight or I 'll call in the police . But , John ...
Mina , please get your bags packed .
Seward , I must be master here or I can do nothing .
Right .
Miss Mina , both this room and your bedroom have been prepared with wolfsbane .
You will be safe if Dracula returns . She 'll be safe , all right , because she 's going with me .
Mina , I 'll be waiting for you in the library .
Oh , John !
Father , talk to him .
Please don 't let him go .
Oh , Briggs -
Miss Mina is to wear this wreath of wolfsbane when she goes to bed .
Watch her closely , and see that she does not remove it in her sleep . I understand , Professor .
And under no circumstances must these windows be opened tonight .
Very well , sir .
You will recollect that Dracula cast no reflection in the mirror .
Yes . And that three boxes of earth were delivered to him at Carfax Abbey .
Quite .
And knowing that a vampire must rest by day in his native soil ,
I am convinced that this Dracula is no legend but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged .
Well , Dr. Seward , what about it ?
Is Mina going with me or not ?
If you take her from under our protection , you will kill her .
Now , John , please , please , be patient .
Mr. Harker , please , come here .
Well .
John , I know you love her , but don 't forget she 's my daughter , and I must do what I think is best .
Mr. Harker ,
I have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things , little-known facts , which the world is perhaps better off not knowing .
I know , but , Professor , all I want is to get Mina away from all of this .
That will do no good .
Our only chance of saving Miss Mina 's life is to find the hiding place of Dracula 's living corpse and to drive a stake through its heart .
Isn 't this a strange conversation for men who aren 't crazy ?
Renfield , you 're compelling me to put you in a straitjacket .
You forget , Doctor , that madmen have great strength .
Dracula has great strength , eh , Renfield ?
Words , words , words .
Oh , Martin . Didn 't I warn you to keep a strict watch ?
What ?
What ? Again ?
Yes , sir .
At once , sir .
Yes , sir .
Right away , sir .
Here . The doctor 's pet loony is loose again .
He came and stood below my window in the moonlight .
And he promised me things .
Not in words , but by doing them .
Doing them ?
By making them happen .
A red mist spread over the lawn , coming on like a flame of fire .
And then he parted it .
And I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red , like his , only smaller .
And then he held up his hand , and they all stopped .
And I thought he seemed to be saying ,
" Rats .
Rats .
" Rats ! "
Thousands , millions of them .
" All red blood , " all these will I give you " if you will obey me . "
What did he want you to do ?
That which has already been done .
Strike me down dead , Doctor .
He 's got me going . Now he 's twisted and broken them iron bars as if they was cheese .
Dracula is in the house .
In the house ?
Doctor , this time he can do no harm .
We are ready for him .
Martin , come with me .
I 'll show you where we can put Mr. Renfield where he won 't escape again .
All right , but I have me doubts .
Come along , old fly eater .
Now , you mustn 't get out of it this time .
I 'm awfully sorry to have to look you up , but you 've got to stay in your room .
Van Helsing .
Now that you have learned what you have learned , it would be well for you to return to your own country .
I prefer to remain and protect those whom you would destroy .
You are too late .
My blood now flows through her veins .
She will live through the centuries to come , as I have lived .
Should you escape us , Dracula , we know how to save Miss Mina 's soul , if not her life .
If she dies by day .
But I shall see that she dies by night .
And I will have Carfax Abbey torn down stone by stone , excavated a mile around .
I will find your earth box and drive that stake through your heart .
Come here .
Come here .
Your will is strong ,
Van Helsing .
More wolfsbane ?
More effective than wolfsbane , Count .
Indeed .
Open the windows , Briggs , and let in some air .
The odor in the room from that horrible weed is stifling . I can 't stand it .
But the Professor gave orders .
Oh , never mind the Professor now .
Now , please , go back to bed at once . I 'm going to call your father .
What is it , Briggs ?
Oh , I don 't know , Mr. Harker .
I felt strangely dizzy .
And when it cleared away ,
Miss Mina was up and dressed and out on the terrace .
And I can 't get her to go to bed .
Well , let me see her .
Tell her I 'm here . John .
Oh , John , I 'm so glad you 're here .
Well , what have they been doing to me , dear ?
Locking me in my room .
And the horrible smell of that awful weed .
It 's been like a nightmare .
What 's been the matter ?
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Mina .
You 're so ... Like a changed girl .
Oh , you look wonderful .
I feel wonderful .
I 've never felt better in my life .
Oh , I 'm so glad to see you like this .
I 've been awfully worried about you .
Mr. Harker .
You better bring Miss Mina inside .
That 's all right , Briggs , now that I 'm here .
Run along , Briggs . Don 't worry .
John . Look , the fog 's lifting .
See how plain you can see the stars ?
Yes .
Millions of them . I 've never seen them so close .
Why , it looks as if you could reach out and touch them .
Would you like me to get you a hat ...
Why , what 's the matter ?
Oh , nothing . Nothing at all .
Come .
Let 's sit down .
Van Helsing .
Seward , that which I feared from the beginning has happened .
What ?
Dracula boasts that he has fused his blood with that of Miss Mina .
In life , she will now become the foul thing of the night that he is .
But Van Helsing ...
No , no , come , Seward .
Come , there 's not a moment to be lost .
Oh , but I love the fog . I love nights with fog .
But only yesterday you said you were afraid of the night .
But , darling , I could never have said anything so silly .
I couldn 't . I love the night .
That 's the only time I feel really alive .
There 's that bat again .
Yes ?
Look out .
He 'll get in your hair .
Yes ?
My , that was a big bat .
I will .
You will what ?
Oh , I didn 't say anything .
Yes , you did . You said , " I will . "
Oh , no , I didn 't .
John , come . Sit down .
There must be some way , some way to save her .
- There is only one ... - John .
That funny little old professor , he has a crucifix .
Now , I want you to get it away from him and hide it .
But why , dear ?
Oh , he 'll be wanting to protect me again from the night or Count Dracula or whatever it is .
Well , I don 't know .
He may be right , Mina .
Your eyes .
They look at me so strangely .
Mina .
Mina , you 're ...
No , Mina , no !
Give me that .
What 's the idea ? Have you gone crazy ?
What are you trying to do ? Frighten her to death ?
No , I was trying to save her .
Save her ?
That 's a fine way .
It 's all right , darling .
Oh , John , darling , you must go away from me ...
The cross , put it away .
After what 's happened , I can 't bear to look at it .
What 's happened ?
I can 't tell you . I can 't .
Ah , but you must . You must tell me .
I have a right to know .
Oh , John .
You can believe everything he says . It 's all the truth .
Dracula , he ...
Dracula ?
Well , what 's he done to you , dearie ? Tell me .
He came to me .
He opened a vein in his arm and he made me drink ...
What is it ? Who is it , Martin ?
It 's that big gray bat again , sir .
It 's no use of wasting your bullets , Martin .
They cannot harm that bat .
No , sir .
He 's crazy .
They 're all crazy .
They 're all crazy , except you and me .
Sometimes I have me doubts about you .
Yes .
That 's Renfield .
What 's he doing at the Abbey ?
Come , Mr. Harker .
Master ! Master , I 'm here !
Where else would he be going but to Dracula ?
What is it , Master ?
What do you want me to do ?
Look , here 's an opening .
Mina ! Mina !
I didn 't lead them here , Master .
I didn 't know .
No !
No ! Wait !
I 'm loyal to you , Master .
I 'm your slave .
I didn 't betray you .
Oh , no , don 't ! Don 't kill me !
Let me live , please !
Punish me , torture me , but let me live !
I can 't die with all those lives on my conscience !
All that blood on my hands !
Mina !
Mina !
He 'll kill her if we don 't get to her .
We must not be too late .
We have him trapped .
Day is breaking . We have him trapped .
He 's killing her .
Mina ! Mina , where are you ?
Mina . Mina .
Mina , where are you ?
Mina !
Mina !
Mina !
Harker !
Harker ! Yes ?
Come .
Where ? Where are you ?
Here . Here , Harker .
I have found them .
Get me a piece of stone , anything .
It will help me drive the stake through their hearts .
Is she ... How is she ?
She is not here .
Thenâ € œ .
Then she may be alive .
Mina !
Mina !
Mina !
Mina !
Mina !
Mina !
Mina !
Oh , John .
John , darling .
I heard you calling , but I couldn 't say anything .
We thought he 'd killed you , dear .
The daylight stopped him .
Oh , if you could have seen the look on his face .
There 's nothing more to fear , Miss Mina .
Dracula is dead forever .
No , no , no .
You must go .
But aren 't you coming with us ?
Not yet , presently .
The Three Penny Opera had its film premiere in Berlin on February 19 , 1931 .
It was restored in 2006 for the film 's 75th anniversary from the original negative in the German Federal Film Archives .
You gents who to a virtuous life would lead us
And turn us from all wrongdoing and sin
First of all see to it that you feed us
Then start your preaching That 's where to begin
THE THREEPENNY OPERA
All you who love your paunch and our propriety
There 's one thing you must finally realize
No matter how you try to twist and turn it
First comes the grub Then you can moralize
There must first be a chance for all now poorly fed To get their slice Of life 's great loaf of bread
How does a man survive ?
How does a man survive By daily cheating
Mistreating , beating others Spitting in their face
Only that man survives Who 's able to forget
That he 's a member of The human race
Gentlemen This truth you cannot shirk
Man lives exclusively By dirty work
Mackie !
The shark has teeth
There they are for all to see
But the knife that Macheath carries
No one knows where it may be
On a blue and balmy Sunday
On the strand a man 's lost his life
A man darts round the corner
People call him Mack the Knife
And Schmul Meier Is still missing
One more wealthy man removed
Somehow Mackie has his money
And yet nothing can be proved
Jenny Towler was discovered
With a knife stuck in her chest
Mackie strolls along the dockside
Knows no more than all the rest
Seven children and an old man
Burned alive in old Soho
In the crowd stands Mack the Knife
Who 's not asked and doesn 't know
And the widow not yet twenty
She whose name All could say
Defiled one night as she lay sleeping
Mackie , what price did you pay
Defiled one night as she lay sleeping
Mackie , what price did you pay
Excuse me , ladies . Care to step inside for a drink ?
I don 't want to be disturbed tonight .
Is Mackie inside ?
- How about you and me , Jenny ?
- Stop it !
Let the lady go .
Lady ?
What lady ?
You mean me ?
Worry about your own wife !
She 's gone off with another guy !
Say hi to Mackie for me .
The best dancer in Soho .
Places on the dance floor !
A full bridal outfit .
In brocade .
Orders from the captain .
He 's getting married this morning at 10 past 2 : 00 in warehouse number 3 in the shipyard on the Thames .
Bring the vicar .
A full bridal outfit in brocade .
Complete home furnishings :
A four-poster bed and rugs , and don 't forget a grandfather clock .
Deliver this .
Dress properly .
Don 't show up looking like this .
I hope this is the last time he gets married .
Deliver this .
Deliver this .
Deliver this .
MR. J. M. BROWN CHIEF OF POLICE , LONDON
Grab it , will ya ?
It 's about time !
Confound it !
One burglary after another ?
A burglary at Selfridge 's ?
Now that 's something !
And nobody was caught ?
They all got away ?
Is that all you have to report , gentlemen ?
You don 't know me very well .
I 'm not chief of London police for nothing .
Ten burglaries every night and no one 's ever caught ?
How can I uphold law and order if you let me down like this , gentlemen ?
When I think of the upcoming coronation festivities , I could ... -
If the slightest thing should go wrong ... -
Come in !
... - you 'll see a side of me you 've never seen before ... -
What is it now ?
- We caught a burglar red-handed .
You actually ... caught a burglar ?
You have him here ?
Bring him in immediately !
Now , gentlemen , I 'll show you how you deal with a fellow like this .
Take your hat off .
You were caught red-handed .
You know this will cost you several years .
You know that in such cases I am ruthless !
... that I am ruthless and unwavering .
Unwavering .
What 's that ?
Leave me alone with this man , gentlemen .
What have you ... -
Very well .
You can go .
No , wait !
Hands up ... if anyone 's there !
Is anyone there ?
There 's no one here .
We can hold the wedding here safe enough .
- Bill Lawgen - And Mary Syer
Last Wednesday man and wife became
As they stood side by side at city hall He wondered where she got the gown and all While she wasn 't too sure of his name
You see the moon over Soho ?
I see it , dearest .
Do you feel my heart beating , my beloved ?
I feel it , my darling .
Wherever you go , I too shall go .
And wherever you are ... I want to be too
And though there 's no license from city hall
And no altar covered with flowers fair
And though you may not know where your gown came from
And there 's no myrtle in your hair
Take the plate on which you eat your bread
Don 't look at it for long Fling it far
Love lasts forever Or else not at all No matter where we are
No , no . Stay a while , Reverend .
Attention , everyone !
It 's ten past 2 : 00 !
Hip , hip , hurray !
- Congratulations , Polly .
- Congratulations , Captain .
Congratulations !
Well , you didn 't make much of an effort .
Champagne in wine glasses !
Junk !
It 's lovely .
Is all this stolen too , Mackie ?
Of course .
Pity we don 't have our own place for these nice things .
This is pathetic .
All Scotland Yard was out and about .
And where 's the grandfather clock ?
No grandfather clock ?
Pathetic .
My wife is beside herself .
What bunglers !
I 'm getting married for once . How often does that happen ?
Reverend !
I 'm so happy you could be here on the happiest day of our lives .
Reverend , this is Miss Peachum , who loves me and wishes to share her life with me .
Congratulations , Polly !
Congratulations , Captain !
Reverend !
Won 't you honor us by staying ?
I 've got ... a christening .
Hopefully we 'll need you for that pretty quick too .
Shut up !
No dirty jokes in the presence of a lady .
And where 's that grandfather clock ?
Where 's the grandfather clock ?
Accompany the reverend .
I do apologize , Reverend .
This area 's not very safe .
This way , Vicar .
Careful .
Sorry .
I would have preferred it if you hadn 't all rushed to the trough .
We could have used a little entertainment .
I 'm hungry , Mackie .
Other people always manage that on these occasions .
Will none of you oblige ?
Is anyone watching at the door ?
Must I see to everything myself ?
Gentlemen ... if none of you will oblige ,
I 'll offer up a little song myself .
I once thought in my innocent youth
And I once was as innocent as you
Perhaps I too would have a suitor one day
Then I must know what to do
And if he 's rich and if he 's nice
And if his collar is white as snow
And if he knows how to treat a lady
Then I shall tell him no
Then you hold your head up high
And don 't let your feelings show
Sure , the moon will shine all night
But the boat on the river will stay tied up tight
That 's as far as you can go
Oh , you can 't simply lie back
You must be cold and heartless as you know
Or else all sorts of things Could happen
Yes , there 's just one answer ... - no
The first to come along was a man from Kent
He was all that a man should be
The second had three ships in the harbor
And the third was mad about me
And they had money and they were nice
And their collars were white as snow
And they knew how to treat a lady
So I had to tell them
No
I held my head up high
Didn 't let my feelings show
Sure , the moon shone all night
But the boat on the river stayed tied up tight
That 's as far as things could go
Oh , you can 't simply lie back
You must be cold and heartless as you know
Or else all sorts of things could happen
Yes , there 's just one answer
No
But then one day when the sky was blue
Came a man who didn 't bother wooing
He tossed his hat on the peg in my room
And I no longer knew what I was doing
Since he had no money and he wasn 't nice
And his collar wasn 't white as snow
Since he didn 't know how to treat a lady
I couldn 't tell him no
I no longer held my head up high
And I let my feelings show
Oh , the moon shone as before
But the boat cast loose and drifted from the shore
That 's just how it had to go
Oh , then you must simply lie back
Oh , you can 't be cold and heartless , you know
Oh , it simply had to happen
There was no such word as
No
Very nice !
Funny !
The missus can sure sing a song !
Very nice !
It wasn 't " nice , " you idiots !
It 's not nice , it 's art !
That was wonderful , Polly .
Too good for this trash .
Bad news !
It 's the sheriff himself !
Hello , Jackie !
Hello ... Mackie .
Dear old Mackie , couldn 't you have done this someplace else ?
Did you have to take over somebody 's warehouse ?
It 's burglary , Mackie ... - another burglary !
Jackie , I 'm delighted you 've come to your old frienďs wedding .
My pleasure , my pleasure .
My heartfelt congratulations on this occasion .
Now don 't be angry , but I must get back to work .
Polly ?
This is
Tiger Brown .
- Chief of London police .
- Mackie , please !
Where haven 't we been together ? India , the Sudan , in a hundred battles .
This is Polly .
The former Miss Peachum .
Peachum ?
Did you say Peachum ?
Is this old Peachum 's daughter ?
You 're making off with old Peachum 's daughter ?
That takes courage !
Why courage ?
She 's the daughter of London 's beggar king !
My dear lady , it 's been delightful , but I must be going .
Good-bye .
Good-bye , Mr. Brown .
Good-bye , Mackie .
I must get back to the office .
The queen 's coronation is coming up , and if anything goes wrong , I 'll be held responsible .
I shudder to think what could happen to me , so I must be going .
Just a moment .
Does Scotland Yard have anything on me in their files ?
On you ?
Not a thing !
It 's all taken care of .
Good-bye , Mackie .
What an awful ladder !
Perhaps next time you might choose a nicer warehouse .
- So that was Tiger Brown ?
- Yes .
We have connections with the highest authorities .
Captain , now comes the best part .
- What is it ?
- Another little surprise .
Bill Lawgen and Mary Syer
Last Wednesday man and wife became
Three cheers for the happy couple !
As they stood side by side at city hall
He wondered where she got the gown and all
While she wasn 't too sure of his name
You 've seen the courtship and marriage of Polly Peachum .
Now I 'll show you the power of the beggar king , or as he calls himself ,
" the poorest man in London . "
Anyone wishing to take up a beggar 's trade in London must have a license from Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum Co .
Twenty schillings .
Ten , Mr. Peachum .
Twenty . And 50 % of your weekly earnings .
But Mr. Peachum ...
I have nothing .
Mrs. Peachum !
Number 314 .
Baker Street district .
Get him some clothes . Outfit C.
Come along , shorty .
My earnings .
What are those ?
The five basic types of misery guaranteed to move the human heart and induce in a man that unnatural state in which he willingly parts with his money .
Outfit C.
- Can 't I have Outfit A ?
- No .
That 's the young man of good family who 's seen better days .
But I 've seen better days myself .
No one will believe your real suffering . Complain of a real stomachache and you 'll only annoy them .
Enough questions . Just get dressed .
Please forgive me .
Hurry it up , shorty .
I can 't stand here holding your trousers till Christmas .
Next .
P-p-please , I have money for a new co-co-co ... -
Polly !
Tell Polly to come down right away .
How many times have I told you that a gentleman must have freshly laundered rags ?
Holes are to be burned in and stains made with candle wax . Those with means to pay are entitled to a uniform that ensures the pity of their clients .
What 's that ?
Your share of my take .
- Is that all ?
- With this stump ?
I 'm lodging a complaint !
This place is a pigsty , and this is a lousy stump !
There , my friend . Now you can go work for a living .
Mr. Peachum !
Thugs !
Thieves !
Next , please .
... a new co-co-costume !
Where 's Polly ?
I 'll get her myself !
Let her sleep !
- Sleep ?
At this hour ?
- Dear God !
Polly didn 't come home ?
Good morning !
G-g-good ... m-m-morning !
What ?
A cane with an ivory handle ?
Mack the Knife !
Dear God !
Good morning .
Crook 's trollop !
Help me undress .
You 'll divorce him !
I love him .
How can I divorce him ?
I 'll tan your behind !
It won 't do any good .
Love is greater than a tanned behind .
That 's what we get for spoiling her with dresses , hats , gloves , and parasols !
Mack the Knife !
My honest business and a common crook !
Hanging him 's the only solution .
Hanging him ?
You and your ideas .
Turn him in to the police .
- I don 't know where he is !
Where ?
With his whores in Turnbridge Alley .
I 'm very sorry , but there 's nothing the police can do .
Really ?
There 's nothing the police can do ?
Then what 's going to happen to you will be a horrible injustice .
Me ?
How so ?
How so ?
If you don 't catch Mack the Knife and hang him , there 'll be a scandal at the queen 's coronation that will cost you your job .
An army of filthy beggars will march up to greet the queen . When they gather before the church by the thousands , it won 't be a festive sight .
They 're not an attractive crowd .
Not an attractive crowd , eh ?
Well , I 'll have them run off ! I 'll force them to ... -
How will it look at the coronation if 2,000 poor cripples must be beaten to the ground ?
It will look very bad , Mr. Brown .
A revolting sight .
You 're ... you 're threatening me !
This is blackmail !
I 'll have you taken away , Mr. Peachum !
Where 's my bell ?
I 'll call to have you taken away if you 're ever so impertinent ... again .
I 'm no criminal .
I 'm just a poor man , Mr. Brown .
Look here , Mr. Peachum :
We 're all poor men here .
Come , my dear , poor Mr. Peachum .
I 'm sure you understand you can only hang a man if you have the man .
You can only arrest a man if you have him .
I can tell you where he is .
A mother-in-law ought to know where her son-in-law can be arrested .
With the ladies in Turnbridge Alley .
The whores in Turnbridge Alley !
What 's that ?
A man lives by his head
He needs a larger size
Just try it for yourself Your head
Won 't feed a pair of lice
You see , for this existence
Man is never sharp enough
Hence his weak resistance
To its tricks and bluff
So make your little plan
Yes , be a shining light
Then make yourself a second plan
None will turn out right
You see , for this existence
There 's no man who 's bad enough
Still it 's nice to watch them
Trying to be tough
Sure , chase your bit of luck
But no need to run fast
Though men always race after it
Luck always runs last
You see , for this existence
Man 's demands are just too tough
All his noisy striving
Is self-deluding guff
Item No. 8 .
Regarding the safes on Oak Street ... only cash is to be taken .
No securities .
Yeah , we 're not getting involved in stock fraud .
Jimmy Two ... will take command of the explosives convoy .
If he 's bumped off , no great loss .
He doesn 't bring much in anymore .
You 're one to talk .
Just a minute .
Three , four , five gold watches was your take this month .
Not much .
Item No. 9 .
Time of the burglary :
8 : 30 , during the coronation celebration .
- Guards will all be at the ceremony .
- And all plastered .
The job 's a cinch .
Mackie !
What 's the matter ?
- You must pack right away .
- Nonsense !
What 's the matter ?
You must leave immediately !
I went to see Tiger Brown , and my father was there too .
They plan to arrest you .
You must pack immediately !
Nonsense !
Come here , Polly .
There 's something I 'd rather do than pack .
No , Mackie . Not now .
Brown stood up for you at first , but then he gave in .
Now he says to tell you ... -
- What ?
There 's nothing more he can do for you .
Come now !
I can trust Brown implicitly .
Scotland Yard has nothing on me .
Maybe they didn 't yesterday , but today they 've suddenly got a whole lot on you .
In Winchester you seduced two sisters , both of them minors .
They told me they were over 30 .
Both of them together .
Your father 's a fine one .
Is this the thanks I get for marrying his daughter ?
Very well .
If I must go , you 'll have to take over running the business .
Gentlemen ...
I must unfortunately take a little trip .
Now , with the coronation coming up ?
Without you , it 's like soup without a spoon !
I 'm therefore temporarily entrusting management of the business to my wife .
What ?
A woman ?
What about the big bank job ?
Shut your trap !
Now , if the bank job goes well , then it 's no more picking pockets and street muggings .
It 's good-bye to Soho and hello to the big city !
Good-bye , you poor fools .
Good-bye , Captain !
Mackie , don 't tear my heart out .
Stay here with me , and let 's be happy .
I 'm tearing my own heart out , because I must go away , and no one knows when I 'll return .
It lasted so short a time .
Is it over then ?
Don 't forget me , Mackie , in foreign parts .
I won 't forget you , Polly .
Kiss me , Polly .
And don 't go to those ladies in Turnbridge .
I love only you .
Farewell , Polly .
Farewell , Mackie .
I 'm in charge now .
Gentlemen ...
I think our captain can depart in full confidence .
We 'll pull off that job just fine , won 't we , gentlemen ?
In first-class style .
Isn 't that right ... gentlemen ?
Well , it 's not for me to say , but I 'm not sure that at a time like this , a woman is the right man .
Nothing personal , ma 'am .
The swine !
You bet it was nothing personal !
Or else the others would have tanned your hide !
Right , gentlemen ?
Nothing personal , of course .
She packs a punch , believe me .
Splendid !
Our lady captain knows how to find the right word !
Bravo , Polly !
From now on we 'll settle accounts every Thursday , gentlemen .
Dismissed .
Jenny , there 's someone here to see you .
- Isn 't that lovely !
- The queen 's coronation gown ?
It cost 7,000 pounds .
Imagine the fine underwear a queen can afford .
Why would a queen need fine underwear anyway ?
I wonder if Mackie will come by today .
I don 't think he 'll ever be back .
WANTED ! £ 100 REWARD FOR MACK THE KNIFE
He took away my daughter .
Married her , he did !
Married her ?
Last night . Married her good and proper .
I see .
So if he comes here today , will you signal from the window ?
Hey , there ! My coffee !
I 'll signal .
Good heavens , Mackie !
What are you doing here ?
Quickly , now !
Mon café
- Haven 't you seen the wanted posters ?
- Yes , I know .
But Thursday 's my day here .
I can 't let such trifles disturb my routine .
Hello , Mackie .
Congratulations on your marriage .
Too bad you missed it .
It was A-1 .
Jenny , come join us .
Yes , Jenny ... come on .
Jenny , read his palm !
Jenny , why that look ?
Just good news , please .
Nothing bad .
Mackie ... when the coronation bells ring at Westminster , you 'll be in a bad way .
My hat and cane .
I 'm going .
My jacket !
- Stay , Mackie .
- Who knows when you 'll be back .
You can count on it .
Gents , you see me washing the glasses
And making your beds without squawking
And you tip me a penny and I thank you well
And you see my dirty rags in this ratty old hotel
And you don 't know to whom you 're talking
But one day there 'll be a shout at the dock
And they 'll ask " What was that shout ? "
And they 'll see me smiling as I wash my glasses
And they 'll ask " What 's she smiling about ? "
And a ship With eight sails And 50 cannon
Will be at the quay
Gentlemen , your laughter will quickly stop
As walls tumble down everywhere
The third day will see the town razed to the ground
Just one ratty old hotel will survive safe and sound
And they 'll ask " Who 's so special that lives there ? "
And that night a cry will go up around the hotel
Folks will ask " Why was this hotel spared ? "
And at dawn they 'll see me coming through the doorway
And they 'll say " So she lived in there ! "
And a ship With eight sails And 50 cannon
Will lay siege to the town
A hundred men will land in the bright midday sun
And stealthily step through the shadows
They 'll enter every doorway Grab every man they see
And clap them in chains and bring them to me
And ask me " Which shall we kill ? "
And ask me " Which shall we kill ? "
That noon there 'll be quiet in the harbor
As they ask me " Who is to die ? "
And then they 'll hear my reply
" All of ' em ! "
And as each head falls I 'll say
" Hoppla ! "
And the ship With eight sails And 50 cannon
Will vanish with me
Jenny , you remember the days before my star rose over this town ?
Even though I 'm now Mack the Knife , I 'll never forget you , Jenny .
What more can a gentleman say ?
Nothing .
Mackie , you must flee !
You 've been betrayed !
Is there still just one way out of this rattrap ?
Stop him !
He went out the window !
You were in quite a hurry just now .
I hadn 't yet had the pleasure .
Is there someone waiting for you ?
She can wait .
I live just over there .
What is it now ?
Never mind !
Come on !
Peachum !
He got away !
Got away ?
His girls helped him escape !
His girls !
Brown is the " girl " in question .
Tiger Brown let his friend get away .
Well , Mr. Brown has " out-Browned " himself .
It 's time we start thinking about the coronation parade .
We only just met , and you 're already leaving .
Goes with the profession .
Busy , busy , busy .
- Come back soon .
- Of course .
No long speeches .
Time is money .
I 'm all yours , gentlemen .
You 've seen Mackie 's bold and reckless nature .
I 'll now show you how , through a loving wife 's cleverness , things take a turn that even you wouldn 't expect .
The gentlemen of the board .
Gentlemen of the board ... one can rob a bank , or one can ...
Use a bank to rob others .
... tread the path of a respectable and law-abiding business ... as my papa so often told me .
" Polly , " he always said ,
" Who 'd be so stupid as to be a burglar these days when we 've got laws ? "
And though my husband ... -
I mean , our most esteemed managing director ... - must hide like a fugitive in foreign parts , I 'm certain he would approve of how we pulled this off !
We bought this quiet , elegant little bank ... which will be more profitable than finding a few puny safes ... - To rifle .
Now we 'll really get down to business !
Gentlemen , we will remain true to this institution 's honorable tradition of building and consolidating the confidence of the pu-pu-public through our integrity and fiduciary trustworthiness .
Bravo !
Excellent !
Thank you , gentlemen .
I 'd just like to add that our firm can only employ top-quality people .
Street muggings and pickpocketing are for idiots !
Forget the romance of the past !
Life begins in earnest now .
Whoever can 't rise to the challenge will be terminated forthwith without remuneration .
Good day , gentlemen .
You can learn a thing or two from her .
This way , Mr. Brown .
Would you like to see him ?
- No ... for Goďs sake .
Handle it yourself , please .
Smith ... give him something to eat . A decent meal .
Wine .
Cigarettes too ?
Of course !
Wait !
He only smokes cigars .
Give him these .
He won 't have time to smoke many more .
Hello , Mackie .
Hello , Smith .
Did Brown have any news for me ?
He 's very distraught , and just when the coronation parade 's coming up .
I say , Smith ... you couldn 't find any heavier handcuffs ?
With your kind permission , I 'd like a more comfortable pair .
Well , we have them in every price range , from one guinea to ten .
All depends on how much you wish to spend .
How much for none at all ?
Fifty .
Thanks , Captain .
Now , what would you like to eat , Captain ?
What have you got in the canteen ?
No , no prison fare for you .
If you 'd like , I 'll get it from ... -
My last supper , eh ?
There , Captain .
Now you can move about freely again .
That 's for someone else , Captain .
So , Captain , what would you like for dinner ?
Leave it to me if you 'd like .
The gentlemen here have always been most satisfied .
DO NOT TURN A DEAF EAR TO MISFORTUNE
Hello ?
Yes , I 'll send them right away .
- Group 3 is ready .
- Off you go !
Filch speaking .
Good .
The 10th district is ready .
They 're to join the fourth at Nelson 's Column at 8 : 00 a.m.
But we 've got real cripples .
How can we make it by 8 : 00 ?
You must .
VICTIM OF MILITARY DESPOTISM
The ugliest are to march on the outside ... so the noble gentlemen will have a pretty sight to look at .
The royal guard is presenting arms .
Dawn is breaking .
They 'll ride right over us !
You 've got slingshots .
- What if they shoot ?
- Gentlemen !
Gentlemen ... at this very moment , 1,432 of your colleagues are marching to pay their respects to the queen .
You too wish to be part of this splendid occasion , you poorest of the poor , who 'd long ago have perished in the sewers of Turnbridge if I hadn 't spent sleepless nights devising a way to wring a few pence out of your poverty .
For I 've shown that the rich of this world have no qualms about causing misery but can 't bear the sight of it !
They have hard hearts but weak nerves .
Well , we won 't spare their nerves today !
By the thousands we 'll tear at their nerves , for our rags do not conceal our wounds !
Gentlemen ... do not be afraid !
The queen will not allow cripples to be attacked with bayonets !
Forward !
Stop , Peachum !
Mackie 's become a bank president !
Call your people back !
Our Polly 's a guest of honor in the stands .
Leave it to me .
Stop !
Back !
Stop where you are !
Back !
Stop !
Go back !
Back , all of you !
Stop !
Go back !
Come to your senses !
Listen to reason !
So make your little plan
Yes , be a shining light
Then make yourself a second plan
None will turn out right
You see , for this existence
There 's no man who 's bad enough
Still it 's nice to watch them
Trying to be tough
I repeat : We must have the remaining £ 3,000 in cash now !
Without fail !
You understand ?
Nervous , gentlemen ?
Well , I 'm very calm .
But Tiger Brown , our best friend , had him arrested !
That must mean something .
We must get £ 10,000 in bail to the police chief .
I 'll take it !
There 's turmoil in the streets .
That 's why I 'm giving it to our bank 's trustworthy servant .
It 's 11 : 00 .
Why aren 't you at the stock exchange ?
Stop !
Turn back !
Listen to me !
Stop !
Using force is pointless !
They 'll shoot you down !
Listen to me !
You 're marching to your own destruction !
Out of the question !
No visitors allowed here !
Smith , let me go in .
Jenny , I can 't be responsible if anyone should see you .
Smith , darling , I 'll only be a second .
I have to see that despicable scoundrel once more .
Mackie and I were close once .
- I know ... -
Smith , sweetie , you can come see me tonight .
I really shouldn 't !
This slut is all I need now .
- Enjoy your meal , Captain .
- My meal ?
No time to put on your face , eh ?
You dirty skunk !
How can you even look at me , after all that 's happened !
Quiet , you stupid hussy !
Monster !
Think I don 't know about Suky Tawdry ?
Dinner 's served , Captain .
Stop that now !
You 'll drive the man crazy !
Ah , Smith , my darling , I love you so .
I 'd rather see him on the gallows than in the arms of another .
Oh , Smith , you 're such a darling , such a fine , upstanding man .
Jenny , let go !
No , I won 't !
So long !
Let me go !
GIVE AND THOU SHALT RECEIVE
More than 300 beggars are marching towards Piccadilly .
Disperse them !
They broke through the barrier at Baker Street .
The procession 's been completely obstructed .
- Arrest them !
- Arrest them all !
Disperse them !
Use clubs if necessary !
Use your clubs ! That 's right !
No , you idiot !
They can 't club thousands of beggars to the ground ... - and on Coronation Day !
You can 't be serious !
- What do you want ?
- I have bail for Mack the Knife .
What 's that ?
What do you have ?
Bail .
For Mack the Knife .
Mackie ? I mean , Mack the Knife ?
Just a moment .
Out of my way .
Hello ? Get me Division C , now !
Hello ?
Brown speaking .
Mack the Knife is to be released immediately .
What ?
Mack ... has ... escaped ?
Wait !
Now you can go .
Confiscated goods .
Going to the coronation , Captain ?
Shut your trap !
I just busted out of jail !
Busted out ?
We sent over bail from City Bank for you , our director .
Bail ?
For me ?
I just told you I busted out !
Really ?
Good God !
£ 10,000 shot to hell !
Pipe down !
What filthy Soho sewer is my office in now ?
What Soho sewer ?
City Bank ! Piccadilly !
Best part of town !
What ?
Piccadilly ?
City Bank ?
A real bank ?
Yes , sir !
An honest-to-goodness bank !
Take the first right , then the third left .
If you see cops , keep to the left !
No , not right ! Left !
I was so worried about you .
They were all after you like bloodhounds .
Did you remember to pretty yourself up every day just as if I 'd been here ?
All I see are your lips . I don 't hear a word you 're saying .
Were you faithful to me too ?
You 're looking good , Polly .
I 'm very pleased with you .
Have you seen the mail yet ?
Mackie , don 't talk business now .
Kiss your little Polly and swear that you 'll never , ever ... -
We 'd better get dressed .
The coronation celebrations have begun .
The police barrier 's broken !
The coronation parade 's breaking up !
Crowds of beggars at Westminster !
Pull the shades !
Hello ?
Anyone here ?
Mackie , I 'm ruined .
What a scandal !
I 'll be sacked !
My days as police chief are over !
Don 't worry .
You 've come to the right place .
You 'll make a great bank director .
How much capital would you like to invest ?
Capital ?
£ 10,000 !
His bail .
I salvaged it .
Hear that , nitwits ?
There 's a lesson there .
Come on .
Come along , you old battleship . Full steam ahead for my whiskey bottle .
Polly ... gentlemen ... before you stands a man whom the king , in his unfathomable wisdom , elevated high above his fellow men .
And yet this man remained my friend through every storm , and so forth and so on .
But fate moves in mysterious ways . You all know what I mean .
Today this man comes to me , Mack the Knife , as one friend to another .
There 's a lesson there .
Do you remember when you and I were soldiers and served in the army in India ?
Yes , Jackie .
Those were the days !
John was there and Jim was too
And Georgie made sergeant in short order
The army doesn 't give a fig who you are
And they marched us north to the border
Soldiers live under the cannon 's thunder
From the Cape to Cooch Behar
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
- An unfamiliar race - Dark or fair of face
They might just chop them up to make their steak tartare
- Johnny 's whiskey was too warm - And Jimmy thought he 'd freeze
- Georgie took them by the arm - Saying , " Don 't desert us , please "
Soldiers live under the cannon 's thunder
From the Cape to Cooch Behar
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
- An unfamiliar race - Dark or fair of face
They just might chop them up to make their steak tartare
John is buried and Jimmy 's dead
And they shot poor Georgie for looting
But blood is still blood-red
And the army 's still recruiting
Soldiers live under the cannon 's thunder
From the Cape to Cooch Behar
If it should rain one night
And they should chance to sight
An unfamiliar race Dark or fair of face
They might just chop them up to make their steak tartare
The poorest man in London and the wealthy Mack the Knife ... - shouldn 't they join forces ?
The poorest man in London is now bankrupt , my dear Peachum , and is just another poor devil .
Today of all days showed me the power of the poor .
With your money and my experience , we can do business , more business than you could ever imagine .
If the poor are so powerful , why do they need us ?
Because they don 't know that we need them .
Gathered for the happy ending
All and sundry pool their might
When the needed funds are handy
Things will usually turn out right
Though a man will fight his rival
To fish the muddy depths
In the end they 'll dine together
And consume the poor man 's bread
For some men live in darkness
While others stand in the light
We see those in the light
While the others fade from sight
How do you do ?
Mr Carl Laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning -
We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein -
A man of science , who sought to create a man after his own image , without reckoning upon God -
It is one of the strangest tales ever told -
It deals with the two great mysteries of creation :
life and death -
I think it will thrill you -
It may shock you -
It might even horrify you -
So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain , now is your chance to , er-- -
Well , we 've warned you -
Amen - Down - Down , you fool !
Now !
Come on !
Hurry , hurry -
- We 've no time to lose - Careful !
Here he comes !
He 's just resting - Waiting for a new life to come -
Here we are -
Look , it 's still here -
Climb up and cut the rope -
No !
Go on
- It can 't hurt you -
Here 's a knife -
Look out !
Here 's the knife -
Here I come -
Is it all right ?
The neck 's broken
- The brain is useless !
We must find another brain -
That 'll do , gentlemen - And in conclusion , ladies and gentlemen , here we have one of the most perfect specimens of the human brain ever to come to my attention at the university -
And here , the abnormal brain of the typical criminal -
Observe , ladies and gentlemen , the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe as compared to that of the normal brain , and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe -
All of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the history of the dead man before us , whose life was one of brutality , of violence and murder -
These jars will remain here for your further inspection -
Thank you , gentlemen - The class is dismissed - Herr Victor Moritz -
Victor -
I 'm so glad you 've come - What is it , Elizabeth ?
Oh , you 've heard from Henry - Yes
- The first word in four months -
It just came -
Victor , you must help me - Of course I 'll help you -
I 'm afraid -
I 've read this over and over again , but they 're just words that I can 't understand -
Listen -
" You must have faith in me , Elizabeth
- Wait - "
" My work must come first , even before you - "
" At night , the winds howl in the mountains - "
" There is no one here - "
" Prying eyes can 't peer into my secret - "
What can he mean ?
What does he say then ?
" I am living in an abandoned watchtower close to the town of Goldstadt - "
" Only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments - "
- His experiments - Yes , that 's what frightens me -
The day we announced our engagement , he told me of his experiments -
He said he was close to a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity -
There was a strange look in his eyes - Some mystery -
His words carried me right away -
Of course , I 've never doubted him - But still , I worry
- I can 't help it -
And now this letter
- All this uncertainty can 't go on
- I must know -
Victor , have you seen him ?
Yes
- About three weeks ago -
I met him walking alone in the woods - He spoke to me of his work , too -
I asked him if I might visit his laboratory -
He just glared at me and said he would let no one go there -
His manner was very strange - Oh , what can we do ?
If he should be ill !
Now , don 't worry -
I 'll go to Dr Waldman , Henry 's old professor in medical school -
Perhaps he can tell me more about all this -
Victor , you 're a dear -
You know I 'd go to the ends of the earth for you -
I shouldn 't like that - I 'm far too fond of you -
I wish you were -
Victor - I 'm sorry -
Good night , Victor - And thank you
- Thank you -
Good night
- And don 't worry
- Promise ?
I won 't -
Victor !
What is it ?
I 'm coming with you - You can 't !
I must
- I 'll be ready in a minute -
Herr Frankenstein is a most brilliant young man , yet so erratic -
He troubles me -
I 'm worried about Henry - Why has he left the university ?
He was doing so well and he seemed so happy with his work -
You know , his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electrobiology were far in advance of our theories here at the university -
In fact , they had reached a most advanced stage -
They were becoming dangerous -
Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed -
You mean changed as a result of his work ?
Yes - His work -
His insane ambition to create life -
How ? How ?
Please tell us everything , whatever it is -
The bodies we use now , dissecting them for lecture purposes , were not perfect enough for his experiments , he said -
He wished us to supply him with other bodies , and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them -
I told him that his demands were unreasonable , and so he left the university to work unhampered -
He found what he needed elsewhere - Oh
- The bodies of animals -
Well , what are the lives of a few rabbits and dogs ?
You do not quite get what I mean -
Herr Frankenstein was interested only in human life -
First to destroy it , then re-create it -
There you have his mad dream -
Can we go to him ?
You will not be very welcome -
What does that matter ?
I must see him -
Dr Waldman , you have influence with Henry
- Won 't you come with us ?
I 'm sorry , but Herr Frankenstein is no longer my pupil -
But he respects you - Won 't you help us to take him away ?
Very well , Fraulein - I 've warned you -
But if you wish it , I will go - Fritz !
Have you finished those connections ?
Yes , they 're done -
Well , come down , then , and help - We 've lots to do - Look out !
Fool !
If this storm develops as I hope , you will have plenty to be afraid of before the night 's over -
Go on , fix the electrodes - This storm will be magnificent -
All the electrical secrets of heaven -
And this time we 're ready - Hey , Fritz ?
Ready -
Why , what 's the matter ?
There 's nothing to fear
- Look -
No blood , no decay -
Just a few stitches -
And look
- Here 's the final touch -
The brain you stole , Fritz - Yes -
Think of it - the brain of a dead man waiting to live again in a body I made with my own hands -
With my own hands -
Let 's have one final test - Throw the switches - Good -
In 15 minutes , the storm should be at its height -
Then we 'll be ready - What 's that ?
There 's someone there - Shh !
Send them away !
Nobody must come here -
Here
- Cover this -
Whoever it is , don 't let them in -
Leave them to me -
Of all the times for anybody to come !
Now ! I 'll show them , messing about at this time of night - Got too much to do -
Wait a minute !
All right , all right !
Wait a minute , I 'm coming -
It 's Dr Waldman , Fritz - You can 't see him
- Go away - All right , knock !
You won 't get in - Henry !
Frankenstein !
Henry ! Frankenstein !
Henry !
Open the door !
Let us in !
Who is it ?
What do you want ?
You must leave me alone now -
It 's Elizabeth !
Open the door !
Henry !
Frankenstein !
What do you want ?
Open the door !
You must leave me alone - At least give us shelter -
What 's this nonsense of locked doors ?
Henry !
Elizabeth , please , won 't you go away ?
Won 't you trust me just for tonight ?
You 're ill
- What 's the matter ?
Nothing
- I 'm quite all right
- Truly I am -
Can 't you see I mustn 't be disturbed ?
You 'll ruin everything - My experiment is almost completed -
Wait a moment
- I understand -
I believe in you - But I cannot leave you tonight -
You 've got to leave !
Henry , you 're inhuman
- You 're crazy !
Crazy , am I ?
We 'll see whether I 'm crazy or not -
Come on up -
You 're quite sure you want to come in ?
Very well -
Forgive me , but I 'm forced to take unusual precautions -
Sit down , please -
Sit down !
You too , Elizabeth
- Please -
A moment ago , you said I was crazy -
Tomorrow , we 'll see about that - Don 't touch that ! I 'm sorry , Doctor , but I insist -
Please -
Doctor Waldman , I learnt a great deal from you at the university about the violet ray , the ultraviolet ray , which you said was the highest colour in the spectrum -
You were wrong -
Here , in this machinery , I have gone beyond that -
I have discovered the great ray that first brought life into the world -
- And your proof ?
Tonight you shall have your proof -
At first I experimented only with dead animals , and then a human heart , which I kept beating for three weeks -
But now I 'm going to turn that ray on that body , and endow it with life -
And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead ?
That body is not dead -
It has never lived -
I created it
- I made it with my own hands from the bodies I took from graves , from the gallows , anywhere -
Go and see for yourself - You too -
Dead , hey ?
Quite a good scene , isn 't it ?
One man crazy , three very sane spectators - Yes !
Test the batteries -
Look
- It 's moving -
It 's alive
- It 's alive !
It 's alive
- It 's moving
- It 's alive !
It 's alive !
It 's alive ! Now I know what it-- - Henry is well , but he 's very busy - It 's alive !
It 's alive !
Henry , in the name of God !
In the name of God ?
!
He said he would get in touch with you soon -
Don 't worry about him , Baron - He 'll be home in a few days -
You two have it all arranged , haven 't you ?
You think I 'm an idiot , don 't you ?
But I 'm not -
Anyone can see with half an eye that there 's something wrong -
And I 've two eyes , and pretty good ones at that -
Well , what is it ?
You 're quite mistaken , Baron -
What 's the matter with my son ?
What 's he doing ?
He 's completing his experiments -
Why does he go messing around an old ruined windmill when he has a decent house , a bath , good food and drink , and a darned pretty girl to come back to ?
Would you tell me that ?
Baron , you don 't understand - I understand perfectly well -
There 's another woman , and you 're afraid to tell me -
Pretty sordid experiments these must be - Huh !
Oh , but you 're wrong !
And how do you know ?
If you please , Herr Baron , the burgomaster -
Well , tell him to go away - But he says it 's important -
Nothing the burgomaster can say can be of the slightest importance -
Good day , Herr Baron
- Fraulein -
Well , what do you want ?
If it 's trouble , go away - I 've trouble enough -
Oh , there 's no trouble , sir - What do you mean , " no trouble " ?
There 's nothing but trouble -
I brought you these flowers - Thank you , Herr Vogel -
Both in my private and official capacities as burgomaster-- -
Yes , yes , yes , we know all about that , but what do you want ?
What I really want to know is when will the wedding be , if you please -
Unless Henry comes to his senses , there 'll be no wedding at all -
But the village is already prepared - Well , tell them to unprepare -
But such a lovely bride-- -
Such a fine young man , the very image of his father -
Heaven forbid - But , sir , everything is ready !
I know that !
Don 't keep on saying so , you idiot !
There 's nothing to cry about -
Good day , Miss Elizabeth - Good day , Herr Moritz -
Good day , Herr Vogel -
Good day , Herr Baron -
And good riddance to you -
There you are
- Huh ! You see how it is -
The whole village is kept waiting , the bride is kept waiting , and I am kept waiting
- Henry must come home , if I have to fetch him myself -
No , no , Baron
- What about his work ?
Stuff and nonsense - What about his wedding ?
There is another woman-- - and I 'm going to find her - Come and sit down , Doctor -
You must be patient -
Do you expect perfection at once ?
This creature of yours should be kept under guard -
Mark my words , he will prove dangerous -
Dangerous ?
Poor old Waldman -
Have you never wanted to do anything that was dangerous ?
Where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond ?
Have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars ?
Or to know what causes the trees to bud ?
And what changes the darkness into light ?
But if you talk like that-- - people call you crazy -
Well , if I could discover just one of these things - what eternity is , for example - I wouldn 't care if they did think I was crazy -
You 're young , my friend - Your success has intoxicated you -
Wake up and look facts in the face !
Here we have a fiend whose brain-- -
Whose brain must be given time to develop -
It 's a perfectly good brain , Doctor -
Well , you ought to know - It came from your own laboratory -
The brain that was stolen from my laboratory was a criminal brain -
Oh , well - After all , it 's only a piece of dead tissue -
Only evil can come of it -
Your health will be ruined if you persist in this madness -
I 'm astonishingly sane , Doctor -
You have created a monster and it will destroy you -
Patience , patience -
I believe in this monster , as you call it -
And if you don 't , well , you must leave me alone -
But think of Elizabeth
- Your father -
Elizabeth believes in me -
My father ?
He never believes in anyone -
I 've got to experiment further -
He 's only a few days old , remember -
So far , he 's been kept in complete darkness -
Wait till I bring him into the light - Here he comes
Come in -
Come in -
Sit down
- Sit down !
You see ?
It understands -
Watch -
Take care now , Frankenstein
Shut out the light -
Sit down -
Go and sit down -
It understands this time
- It 's wonderful - Frankenstein , where is it ?
Quiet , you fool !
Get away with that torch -
It 's a monster - Quiet Aagh ! Quick !
Fetch the rope , quick -
Stop pushing -
- Quiet ! Get him to the cellar - Shoot it !
Stop that !
You 'll have the whole countryside on us !
- Leave it alone - Listen
Come away , Fritz -
- What 's that ? Leave it alone
Who 's there ? It 's Fritz ! Come on , Doctor - Quick , hurry - Get back -
Come on , quickly - He hated Fritz - Fritz always tormented him -
Come , pull yourself together -
What can we do ?
Kill it , as you would any savage animal -
We must overpower him first - Get me a hypodermic needle -
It 's murder - It 's our only chance -
- Hurry - Got it ? In a few minutes , he 'll be through that door - Come , quick
Yes , here it is -
Yes - Aagh ! It 's very strong
- Half-grain solution - Good
- Now then -
You stand there
- When he goes toward you , I will make the injection in his back -
Ready ?
Back ! Dr Waldman Get back !
- Dr Waldman !
Are you hurt ?
No , I 'm all right
- It 's nothing -
See who 's at the door -
What 's happening ?
Elizabeth and your father are coming to see you -
Keep them out - Too late !
They must not see that - Here , quick , give me a hand -
Quick !
Henry , hurry , get that blood off your face before your father and Elizabeth get here -
Pretty sort of place for my son to be in , I must say -
Is that the front door ?
Yes , this is it -
Right -
I don 't like it , but-- - here goes - There doesn 't seem to be anybody in the place -
God-- -
What a-- - What a forsaken place -
Are you trying to burn it down , eh ?
What 's that for , eh ?
Well , what 's the matter with you ?
You look as if you 've been kicked by a horse -
Where 's Henry ? Why-- -
Well ?
He can 't be disturbed just now -
Oh , can 't he ?
Huh ! I 'll soon settle that nonsense -
Victor , where is he ?
This place seems to drive everybody crazy -
Oh , heavens--
- What 's that ?
I beg your pardon
- I am Dr Waldman -
Oh , are you ?
I 'm Baron Frankenstein -
Perhaps you know what all this tommyrot 's about -
I-- - I 'll be shot if I do !
I advise you to take Henry away from here at once -
Well , what do you suppose I 'm here for ?
Pleasure ?
Where are you , my dear ?
Oh , there you are -
Let 's see what 's up the awful stairs -
I don 't know how the deuce I 'm going to get up ' em , but-- - Leave them alone -
No banisters or anything else-- - How much further ?
Come in -
Henry - Elizabeth -
Henry !
Victor !
Dr Waldman !
Come quickly -
My dear , what have they done to you ?
Poor Fritz--
- It 's all my fault-- -
Get him on the sofa -
Have you got any brandy ?
Quick , quick , quick -
Here , I 'll do that -
My boy--
- Now , now-- -
Now drink
- Drink this -
There - There , that 's better -
I 'm going to take you home with me , Henry -
No , I can 't
- My work
- What will happen to the records of my experiment ?
We will preserve them - And-- -
I will see that it is painlessly destroyed -
Yes , yes
- Leave it all to me -
Poor Fritz - All my fault -
There , Henry - You can 't do any more now -
You must come home until you get well again -
You 'll soon feel better when you get out of here - It 's like heaven being with you again -
Heaven wasn 't so far away all the time , you know -
I know
- But I didn 't realise it -
My work
- Those horrible days and nights -
I couldn 't think of anything else -
Henry , you 're not to think of those things any more -
You promised - All right -
Let 's think about us - When will our wedding be ?
Let 's make it soon -
As soon as you like -
For three generations , these orange blossoms have been worn at our weddings -
Your great-grandfather wore this , Henry -
Looks as good as new now , hey ?
- Here is one to make the best man look still better - 30 years ago , I placed this on your mother 's head , Henry -
Today , you 'll make me very happy by doing the same for Elizabeth -
And I hope , in 30 years ' time , a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition -
And now , how about a little drink , eh ?
My grandfather bought this wine and laid it down -
My grandmother wouldn 't let him drink it - Bless her heart -
Here 's to your very good health -
Well , are you all full ?
Yes ? Come along -
Here 's a health to a son of the House of Frankenstein -
A son to the House of Frankenstein -
Here 's a jolly good health to young Frankenstein -
Young Frankenstein -
Give the servants some champagne - This stuff 's wasted on ' em -
Well , well , well -
Go on , mop it up - It 'll do you good -
House of Frankenstein - To the House of Frankenstein -
Now then - Now be off about your business -
Listen !
Listen to ' em !
The boys and girls of the village are out here - It 's extraordinary how friendly you can make a lot of people on a couple of bottles of beer -
Tomorrow they 'll all be fighting -
No doubt !
They 're calling for you , Baron - Hey-ho -
Well , I suppose I 'd better show myself - Quiet !
Thank you all very much indeed -
I 'm very pleased to see you all , and I hope there 's plenty of beer -
There 's lots more where that came from - You stay here , Maria - I 'll just take a look at my traps -
Then we 'll go to the village and have a grand time , huh ?
You won 't be long , Daddy ?
Oh , no -
If Franz comes by , tell him I 'll be back soon -
Daddy , won 't you stay and play with me a little while ?
I 'm too busy , darling -
You stay and play with the kitty , huh ?
Bye , Daddy - Goodbye -
Be a good girl now -
Come on , kitty -
Who are you ?
I 'm Maria -
Will you play with me ?
Would you like one of my flowers ?
You have those , and I 'll have these -
I can make a boat -
See how mine float ?
No ! Henry - Elizabeth ! Ohh ! No , you 're hurting me !
How lovely you look - But you shouldn 't be here -
I must see you for a minute -
Why ?
What 's the matter ?
Could you leave us for a moment ?
Why , of course -
Why , what is it ?
I 'm so glad you 're safe -
Safe ?
Of course I 'm safe -
But you look worried
- Is anything wrong ?
No -
No , forget my foolishness -
It was just a mood - There 's nothing the matter -
Of course there isn 't !
Henry , I 'm afraid
- Terribly afraid -
Where is Dr Waldman ? Why is he late for the wedding ?
He 's always late
- He 'll be here soon -
Something is going to happen -
I feel it
- I can 't get it out of my mind -
You 're just nervous -
All the excitement and preparation -
No - No , it isn 't that
- I 've felt it all day -
Something is coming between us -
I know it - I know it !
Sit down and rest
- You look so tired -
If I could just save us from it - From what , dear ?
From what ?
I don 't know !
If I could just get it out of my mind !
I 'd die if I had to lose you now , Henry -
Lose me ?
Why , I 'll always be with you -
Will you , Henry ?
Are you sure ?
I love you so -
Sure
- How beautiful you look -
Henry ! Henry !
What 's that ?
What 's that ? !
Henry !
Dr Waldman !
What about Dr Waldman ?
Henry , don 't leave me !
No , darling , you stay here - Henry !
Henry !
Dr Waldman 's been murdered in the tower -
The monster -
He 's been seen in the hills , terrorising the mountainside - He 's in the house -
He 's upstairs ! It 's in the cellars - It 's Elizabeth !
Come on - Elizabeth !
That 's Maria ! Silence ! What is it ?
Don 't let him come here - No , no , no , darling
- It 's all right -
Don 't let him come here - It 's all right , darling
- It 's all right -
Oh , look !
Silence !
Silence !
What is it ?
Maria
- She 's drowned -
- But she has been murdered - Silence !
I 'll see that justice is done -
Who is it ?
How is Elizabeth now ?
I don 't know -
She 's still in a daze
- Just looks at me and says nothing
- It 's maddening -
Easy , old man
- She 'll be all right -
Our wedding day - Steady -
Your wedding will be postponed a day at most -
A day ?
I wonder - What do you mean ?
There can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive -
I made him with these hands , and with these hands I will destroy him -
I must find him !
I 'll go with you -
No
- You stay here and look after Elizabeth -
In your care - Quiet !
- You understand ?
Quiet !
Ludwig -
You will search the woods - Those are your group -
We 'll get him !
Quiet !
Herr Frankenstein -
You will take to the mountains - Those are your people -
I-- - I will lead the third group by the lake -
And remember-- - remember-- - get him alive if you can , but get him !
Quiet !
Search every ravine , every crevasse , but the fiend must be found !
Are you ready ?
Light your torches and go !
Stop !
Frankenstein , mountains !
Ludwig !
Lake party , this way !
Come on , boys !
Keep together -
You search there - The rest , come with me - Look lively !
Herr Frankenstein ! Come on , men ! Come on !
Herr Frankenstein !
This way !
Which way did he go ?
Which way did he go ? Tell me ! Tell me !
Over there -
You stay here and take care of him -
The rest , follow me - Come on !
Come on , quick !
No , come back !
Turn the hounds loose ! There he is ! This way -
Herr Frankenstein !
Herr Frankenstein , where are you ?
I think he 's up there
- Come on , follow me -
Quick !
Hello !
Fire
- Fire !
Help ! Help !
Listen - Help !
It 's Frankenstein -
That way !
This way !
Come on , hurry ! Hurry !
Look , they 're there !
The murderer -
He can 't get away ! Aaagh ! Have you got it ? He 's alive -
Frankenstein !
Frankenstein -
Bring him down to the village and let 's take him home -
Murderer !
Burn the mill !
Burn the mill !
Come on , hurry - Quiet , quiet -
Well , go ahead and knock -
Well , well , well , what 's all this ?
What do you want , hey ?
What 's this ?
If you please , Herr Baron , we thought that Mr Henry could do with a glass of his great-grandmother 's wine -
Fine old lady , my grandmother -
Very foreseeing of her to prevent my grandfather drinking this -
Mr Henry doesn 't need this -
As I said before , I say again , here 's to a son to the House of Frankenstein -
Yes , indeed , sir
Just you wait a little while , The nasty man in black will come
Stop singing that awful song
Don 't you hear me ?
I told those kids to stop singing that awful song But they keep singing it over and over
As if we haven 't heard enough of that murderer
Oh , leave them be If they 're singing , at least we know they 're okay
10,000 Marks Reward WHO is THE MURDERER ?
Since June 11 , little KLAUS KLAWlTZKY and his sister KLARA have disappeared
What a pretty ball !
What 's your name ?
Elsie Beckmann
Did Elsie come with you ?
No , she didn 't
Thank you
A thrilling new chapter ! Passionate , moving , sensational
Just a moment , Mr. Gehrke
- Yes ? Have you seen Elsie ?
Didn 't she just come up the stairs ?
No , she isn 't here yet
She won 't be long now . Good-bye , Mrs. Beckmann
Good-bye , Mr. Gehrke
Extra ! Extra !
Because the police have not published my first letter I am writing today directly to the NEWSPAPERS Continue your investigations
Everything will happen just as I have told you . But I have not yet finished
10,000 MARKS REWARD Who is the murderer ? Christ ! Here we go again .
It 's horrible 10,000 Marks The lettering is too small
We can 't read it Hey , you , read it out loud - " The unknown murderer " .
Quiet ! " The terror in our town has found a new ... " Certain evidence leads us to believe that the murderer is the same one who has already killed eight children
We must remind you again that a mother 's first duty is to guard her children from the danger which always threatens
Also , the danger is often hidden in some attractive bait
Candy , a toy , and fruit can be the murderer 's weapons
Come on ! Come on ! Read , read on
Okay , okay . " The anxiety of the general public is very high because the police have not yet completed their investigations
" The criminal has left no clue . Who is the murderer ? "
What is he like ?
Where is he hiding ?
No one knows .
Still , he is one of us
Is it your neighbor ?
Yes , that 's right
Why look at me when you say that ?
- You know very well .
- What do I know very well ?
- Think about it .
- What are you saying ?
I saw you go up those stairs behind that little girl
What ? !
You are crazy , you dirty swine !
Who 's a swine ? Me ? Or a man who chases little girls ?
You bastard ! You swine !
Murderer ! Gentlemen !
Gentlemen ! I 'll see you in court . I 'll see you in court
Slanderer ! Terrible man ! The police listen to him !
They 're searching my house !
How awful !
What a shame ! Searching a man 's house because of an anonymous letter
Mr. Jager , calm down !
We 're only doing our job When we are so upset ? Scared about the children
Look , that 's why the police must follow every clue
Any man in the street could be the guilty one
Can you please tell me what time it is ? Yes , my child
Now , my child , go home .
Where do you live ?
What 's it to you where the kid lives ?
Why were you bothering that kid ?
But - but - I did nothing !
What do you want with me ?
Just you wait and see
Let me go !
It 's an outrage ! - What 's going on ?
- It 's an outrage !
Don 't get so excited Punch him in the face !
- Bothering children .
- Acting like a big shot ! Let me go !
I did nothing ! You wanted to get her alone , didn 't you ?
Yes , then kill her like all the others , right ?
It 's the murderer !
It 's him ! Hold him ! Call the police !
No police around when you need them . Officer , officer !
Move along please , move along now .
Don 't block !
You can catch pickpockets but you 'd better get the murderer
What ?
Is he the murderer ?
Move along now .
Come on , get a move on
MURDERER writes TO NEWSPAPERS
It 's a terrible scandal
This will have a bad effect on public opinion , lnspector .
It 's very serious
But , sir , we cannot stop the murderer from writing letters !
This man is a mental case He gets a kick from seeing himself in the papers
We immediately got in touch with the newspaper
They sent us the original letter . The lab is working on it
Of course , you can 't get good fingerprints from a postcard which went through so many hands
We 'll compare the results with our archives
We must try everything to find a clue or a lead Then , we 'll send the letter to the graphologist
The very particular shape of the letters ... do you follow me ?
Some of the broken letters reveal an actor 's personality which can be indolent or even lazy
Yes , lnspector , certainly . You and your men are very good
But , nevertheless , results , we must have results
Minister , my men are only getting 12 hours sleep a week as well as searches on the spot , Minister
They start their shift already tired Don 't forget , this job is nervously trying especially when the success rate is so low
The homicide officers work restlessly
They 're always on alert following any clue , even the slightest one that may lead us to our man
Minister , consider their findings on the scene of the crime
We find , for instance , behind a hedge a little white paper bag
Clearly it held the candy
In a corner , we found some crumbs and some sugar grains
Within a radius of 2 kilometers , we have searched in all the candy shops to find out where the bag came from
But in vain
Every day the search widens
but , of course , no one remembers anything
Nevertheless , we keep on searching , getting nowhere without much hope of finding a solution .
Our men ...
What good is that ?
I know you 're trying but an unknown murderer terrorizes the town
A town of four million and your police are failing
Minister , you don 't seem to understand the difficulties
Only on the way home of the missing child we got fifteen different testimonies
Just listen : " Testimony 1478 in the Beckmann murder case ... "
- More than you , Sir !
Gentlemen ! Can 't you agree what color hat that little girl wore when you saw her ?
Of course , lnspector , it was red
- lnspector , it was green .
- lt was a red hat !
It was a green hat !
Stop ! It 's hopeless .
Thank you , gentlemen
- Of course , lnspector if you listen to a color-blind man !
The police have investigated over 1,500 clues
Documents fill 60 volumes .
We have all available men
We have systematically combed all adjoining areas
Every thicket , every piece of undergrowth , every bush in every hole , we might find something
We sent out police dogs . The best trackers are on the scent to no avail .
Since the murderer 's first crime police have inspected all the flop-houses every night and checked the identity of every vagrant
Such measures hurt our popularity and make people nervous
But we watch all railway stations and raid the underworld hangouts
Despite all this , the police haven 't succeeded in finding anything
The police . Get back !
Please let me go , won 't you ? You son of a bitch !
Let go !
Let her go , you filthy pig !
The head cop ! Quiet !
You 'd like that , wouldn 't you ?
Police orders : nobody leaves . Get your papers ready
C 'mon kids , let 's not be stupid
It 's Fatty Lohmann ! Loh-mann , Loh-mann , Loh-mann !
Loh-mann ! Loh-mann !
Quiet ! Quiet !
You 'll wear yourselves out It would be better if you got the murderer Yes !
Quiet !
Be reasonable !
Spread out .
All of you spread out .
- Show me your papers Please let me go , lnspector
Don 't make any trouble . No papers and you go to headquarters
I am innocent
Don 't talk nonsense
Quiet !
Show me your papers
Don 't push .
It 's everybody 's turn
- Have you got your papers ?
- I can 't go around with my birth certificate . That 's asking too much
- Don 't mess with me . - That 's asking too much , lnspector Headquarters for you
Look here , it 's disgusting
Poor workmanship , old boy .
To headquarters Better luck next time , Willie
Shut your face ! Next
What 's wrong ?
" Unsolved burglary at a fur shop . "
Well , I guess I 'd better take you down to headquarters
But ... my papers are in order
Next No luck , huh ?
Papers
I have none Headquarters
Next , come on , let 's go
This is wrecking our business , Sarge , trouble every night
You can 't have ten minutes peace anymore . Give us a break !
It 's no joke for us either , out every night
Of course , but you 're drivin ' away my clientele and the guy you 're looking for ain 't here
Do you know how mad everyone is about this guy who 's causing a raid every night ?
' Specially the girls .
Sure , they solicit but believe me , everyone is a little mother at heart
I know a lot of crooks , get sort of tender when they see kids
If they catch that bastard they 'll wring his neck
Ready to go , Sarge ? Good night
So it 's the Crocodile tonight .
Two loads for the nick
What 's keeping Schranker ?
Is it three o 'clock yet ?
I 'll find out
Hello , the exact time , please .
Two minutes to three Thank you
There are more police on the street tonight than whores
Wherever you spit , cops
Even when you 've got a broad , they don 't leave you alone
They 've gone nuts . All they think about is the murderer
I have a little six-year-old and every night I have to look under the bed and in the closet to see if the murderer is hiding there
You can 't even do your job . The police are everywhere
There 's no privacy anymore . I 'm fed up with it Tell us something new
What 's keeping Schranker ?
Maybe he 's been caught
Not him .
He did a bank job in London .
Scotland Yard trapped him
There he was , hands up , back to the wall , millions of cops around two seconds later there were two corpses and he 'd beat it !
The best man between Berlin and San Francisco
Six years they 've looked and they haven 't caught him yet
God be praised ! At last ! Well , hello !
Good afternoon Are you crazy ?
Close the curtains
Gentlemen , the meeting can now begin
According to regulations , I confirm that the leadership of every organization in our union is represented I assume you are all authorized to vote on behalf of your members Good .
Let 's not be held up by procedure
We all know why we are here .
Some non-member is screwing up our affairs .
Daily raids by the police for the child murderer interfere with our business .
We can 't put up with this pressure any longer in every hotel , cafe or pad
This state of affairs must not be allowed to continue
We have to put things right again or we 'll all be ruined
Our funds are exhausted .
We 'll have to use money allocated for our colleagues ' wives who are being " hosted " by the state
Furthermore , our reputation is suffering
When I run into a cop while on business , he knows the risk and so do I . If one of us dies , OK , that 's a risk one takes
It can happen . But you and I are not on the level of this murderer
Absolutely !
We are doing our job , we have to make a living
But this monster has no right to live .
He must disappear !
He must be eliminated , without pity , without scruples
Gentlemen , our members have to carry on normal business without being handicapped by nervous policemen
I ask you for advice
I suggest a closer watch on lD cards , systematic searches and police raids .
More raids , and much tougher ones
Spies .
We need spies among the police to give us warnings
The girls must take a little more notice of the cops We get into trouble because one of the girls has talked too much to her cop boyfriend .
We must be allowed to search any house , apartment , back yard in order to find a clue
We have contacts , we have to make a statement to the press we have to tell them that we condemn the bastard too
We should make it known that he isn 't in the underworld
I 'm sure it 's a man who looks like he wouldn 't hurt a fly
In his normal state , he might even play marbles with the kids or cards with his wife .
Otherwise , murderers like Grossmann or Haarmann couldn 't live for years like they did without their neighbors suspecting them at all
We have to get that across to the public . They must help
Don 't talk to me about the public helping .
It disgusts me just to hear them talk .
Excuse me , Chief !
But it 's the truth . Christ !
Help from the public brings no clues !
Just a pile of letters with the most incredible accusations !
Quite true Calls to the police the moment a garbage man crosses a yard !
But when we need accurate information , they can 't remember !
They 've seen nothing .
You 're exaggerating a little , Lohmann
Most of the people don 't feel concerned
The majority of them doesn 't realize that a child disappearance is also their problem
Let 's get one of those guys , a telepath one who finds handkerchiefs and pocketbooks that have been hidden
I don 't think the reward is enough Chief , we have to offer a real fortune for the murderer
None of this is getting us anywhere - That won 't do any good .
- What 's your idea ? Well , we just can 't wait until the police decide to arrest the fellow
The difficulty in solving crimes like this comes from the fact that the criminal and the victim are connected only by chance
An instantaneous impulse is the killer 's only motive
We find the victim , we identify him , then we find out when he was last seen .
Then , nothing more
Children disappear and you know what state we find them in
if we find them
And the killer ... as we know , in this kind of crime never leaves a mark behind
The police have been looking for eight months
Now , they 'll catch him only by luck
- We can 't wait for that .
- We 'll be ruined before then
Then what will we do ?
We 'll have to catch him ourselves
There is still one possible way !
The guilty man must have a record somewhere . A man that disturbed must have come upon the law before .
We 've got to contact every clinic every prison , every asylum .
We 'll have to make inquiries about everyone freed as harmless but with the same pathological condition as the killer
Every square foot must be permanently watched
From now on , no child takes a step without us being warned
OK , but how do we do it ?
There must be people who can go everywhere , not be noticed who can follow children without arousing suspicion who can follow children right up to their front doors
People no one would suspect
But who ?
People like that don 't exist .
Who could do it ? Who ?
The beggars .
The beggars ' union can do it
- Sausage going up .
- God ! This cheese smells good
Stop snoring ! You 'll wake up the lice
Now we must take the back yards
Yes , from number 1 to 88
Next
You are responsible for the courtyards in every block , 1 to 88
Right !
- What 's next ?
What 's your union number ?
3 , 7 , 95 , Emil Dustermann 3 , 7 , 95 , Dustermann , Emil
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen
Thank you
" When searching homes , we must look for any clue which could establish where the murderer 's letter to the papers originated
If there is an old wooden table , if there is a red pencil or writing paper of the same type . Inquiries must be discreet . "
Idiot
And here 's a list of mental patients who have been let out as cured or harmless in the last five years
And that 's a list of their present addresses
Good morning
Does a Mr. Beckert live here ?
What ?
Does Mr. Beckert live here ?
I 'm afraid I can 't hear you . I 'm a bit hard of hearing

A walnut table with a cloth .
No red pencil or traces of one
No writing paper .
In the waste basket , a printed ad and a postcard with flowers and " Regards , Paul " on it but no address of sender .
Ariston brand , a bag of candy with the candy store name on it
Hello . Get me the file on the Marga Perl murder .
Thank you very much
That 's funny .
I 've heard that before
It was ... it was ...
Hey !
Henry !
What is it ?
Listen a moment .
Someone whistling .
Can you hear him ? There
He 's just stopped .
Did you see him , the guy who was whistling ?
- Yes , I can still see him . - Yes ? Yes .
He 's talking to a little girl and walking her down the street
- After him and don 't let him go !
- But why ? The day Elsie Beckmann was killed , someone bought a balloon
He was with a little girl and he whistled just like that !
Damn it , man !
Are you crazy throwing peels on the ground ?
I might have broken my neck !
Unbelievable I should report you to the police , you 're a menace to the public
Uncle
There !
They found three cigarettes butts at the scene of the crime . That 's it . Aristons !
Yes , the cigarettes are the same , but there 's no old wooden table
Of course , he could have written that letter somewhere else
Heavens , the windowsill !
You 're right
A red pencil !
God , at last we 're getting somewhere
They have his trial ! - Have they found him ?
- The beggars found him - He was talking to a little girl .
- They put a mark on him Can 't you be quiet ?
What 's that ?
They are following the sign .
He isn 't out of sight for a second
He 's being watched
- Uncle . - What is it ?
You 're all dirty
Where ?
There , on your shoulder
Here , I 'll wipe it off
- What 's the matter ?
- Come on , let 's go
He hasn 't come out yet or we would have seen him
He must be in the courtyard , he didn 't come out this way
He must be somewhere
Maybe he 's hiding inside the building
Closing time !
He mustn 't get out with everyone leaving Christ !
Here come the first ones already
Let 's go out in the street
Keep a sharp lookout
Turn off the light or he 'll suspect something when he comes back
What time is it ?
Nearly 6 : 30
He must still be in the building , anyway , he didn 't come out
No , just a moment
The beggars have gone for more help to search the whole area
The murderer must still be in the building
What sort of place is it ?
Nothing but offices .
I don 't know what 's in the cellar
There 's a branch of the savings bank on the ground floor and from the first to the fifth , nothing but offices above that are lofts
Look at that . It ain 't possible Anyone there ?
Anyone there ?
What next ? Anyone there ?
Yes , good Looks like that guy is really cornered now
Hello . Just a moment .
What ? Ok , call me right back
What is it ?
What 's the matter ?
Are you crazy or something ? The police ? No .
We 're going to get that guy ourselves
Listen ... now , the time is
8 : 00
Then at 9 : 00 , 10 : 00 , 11 : 00 !
Good evening .
Did you know your gates are not closed ?
But that 's impossible !
I 've only just ...
Open up , and no noise !
Are you going to open up ?
Come on , get it open
How many watchmen are there in the building ?
Ok , so you don 't want to answer ?
There are two watchmen on their rounds
Shit !
Careful with the lights .
And don 't walk like elephants - What 's the story ?
- He isn 't in the basement .
We went through it and found nothing
Friede and Auguste are still going through the boiler rooms
Wait That 's the last one
Go up and join Emile . He needs help
Go on , get a move on !
It 's a new type of time switch
Here 's a general plan here .
If the time switches aren 't set they automatically go off at the nearest police station . Get it ?
Have you got it ?
What do you think I am , some kind of a nut ?
- He isn 't in the boiler room . - Fine
We moved all the coal
Are you nuts ?
What if the door is wired up ? Want to get the police here ?
Well , we have to get in if we 're going to search the whole place
But not by the door , you ass !
Use the office on the floor above Go through the ceiling
Hey ! What 's up ?
Hey !
Answer me . What 's happening ? Paul - tell us
What 's going on ?
I heard some banging ! - What did you say ? - What 's the hurry ?
He 's in the attic !
I heard him knocking . He 's in the attic !
Keep quiet
Get on with it , then He must be there
There 's the switch
Force the locks
I 've got him .
He 's in the attic
I heard someone hammer I told Schranker immediately
He 's up there with 8 men .
They 'll get him any moment
I just came down to tell you If I hadn 't been alert , we 'd have looked for him for hours
Look out ! The watchman !
3 ... 1 ... 4 314
Let 's get out of here !
The cops will be here any moment . The watchman rung in Let 's get out of here !
We 've got 5 more minutes and 6 more compartments to search .
Carry on . Get on with it . Only hurry !
He 's not in here
Not here either Come on , keep it up ! Next door
Here he is , here he is , the dirty bastard !
Get going , hurry up - Everybody out !
Go on - move !
Hurry up , quickly !
He 's not down here . Who 's pulled up the ladder ?
Who 's pulled up the ladder ?
Hello Hands up
How can I put my hands up when I 'm trying to hang onto the ladder ?
Get out of there
For once , I 'm innocent
As a newborn babe
This will surprise you , Franz , but I believe you
Well , then everything is in order .
I can leave then
One minute
I 'll take your word for it
On condition you tell me who was the man you were looking for and found there ?
I don 't understand , lnspector .
A man , you said ?
I know nothing about that .
There must be some mistake
I know nothing , nothing at all
Of course .
Only I don 't understand why you are covering up for the gang who left you in the lurch .
Funny friends ! Leaving you right in it and running off . Bah !
That won 't wash with me , lnspector
After all , I 'm not risking very much Maybe a little bit of damage . But nothing was stolen
Of course , something was stolen .
In fact , a good deal
What ?
Stolen ? How much ?
If you talk , I 'll tell you
I 've already told you , I don 't know anything
Well , think about it .
It 's amazing what one remembers when one is left alone for an hour or two
Take him away !
Send the night watchman in here
Sit down
Now then , you said in your statement
- Listen carefully You may have to repeat it under oath
You clearly heard one of the burglars say to another , " we 've found him
I 've discovered the guy .
He 's in the attic . " Is that correct ?
Yes , lnspector .
Yes , I 'll swear to whatever you want
Right . You may go home now .
But please be ready to testify
Tell me , is Inspector Lohmann in the building ?
He 's talking to someone ?
Hasn 't come in yet .
You 're watching Mrs. Winkler ?
We 've surrounded the whole block
If he wanted to get home , he 'd run into us
Now you have to wait
I 'll be in my office if you have some news
What do you want ?
I wanted to ask you a favor
Disgusting
I wanted to ask you
Anyway , read a bit of that
- Reports ?
- Yes Burglary in an office block
Bennostrasse ?
That 's a very quiet neighborhood
Perhaps it 's not as quiet as all that
Hell , this is becoming serious
Did they intend to empty the whole place , then ?
What can they have been looking for in the coal ?
Look at that .
It 's incredible
Good Lord !
This is madness !
Ah , now it makes sense .
They were after the safe Good God !
What 's it all about ?
They haven 't even attacked that one .
Well , I 'll be damned ! Well , what have you got to say ?
Nothing stolen , but a man taken
Fantastic !
And Franz the burglar was arrested .
Isn 't talking
Frightened , evidently . Actually , I know him well
He 's one who 'd rather jump from the fifth floor than get mixed up in a murder
Could we set a trap for him ?
Could you help me , Lohmann ?
I see what you 're getting at
Let 's take a look at this Franz
You 're wanted for questioning What ?
Four people for me ?
The murder squad ?
What do you want with me ?
What 's the murder squad want ?
Yes , old boy , your case has been passed over to me now
But why ?
What for ?
You did your work a little too well
One of the watchmen
Dead ?
Planning and assisting with a murder .
It 's a bad show , Franz I can 't go on with it . I don 't want to have anything to do with it
I 'll tell you everything , everything I know
Very wise , but unfortunately too late
Inspector , it can 't be too late ...
Please , lnspector It isn 't possible !
Listen , I 'm going to tell you everything
Even who we were looking for in that damn building
The child murderer
What ? Who ?
The child murderer , lnspector
Wait
This had to happen to me !
Sit down
Now , we 're going to have a little talk
If you want to , lnspector And mind you , don 't lie .
OK , let 's start What have you do to with the murderer , and where 'd you take him ?
Well , lnspector , you know the old distillery of Kuntz and Levy ?
- The one that went bankrupt ?
What do you want with me ?
What do you bastards want with me ?
What do you want ?
Help ! Help !
Let me go . I want to get out . Get me out of here
Let me out !
You will not get out of here
But gentlemen , I don 't even know what you want me for
I beg you , set me free .
There must be some mistake
No , no .
No mistake .
No mistake
Do you recognize it ?
It 's a balloon like the one you gave little Elsie Beckmann !
A balloon like that
Where did you bury little Martha ?
But I never ... I never even knew her
You never knew her ?
And what about this one ? And this one ?
Stop him , stop him ... Don 't let him get away
Let me go !
You talk of rights .
You will get your rights
We are all law experts here
from 6 weeks in Tegel prison to 15 years in Brandenburg
You will get your rights , you will even get a lawyer
Everything will be done according to the rule of law
A lawyer ? A lawyer ?
I don 't need a lawyer
Who is accusing me ?
You , maybe ? You ?
Just a moment . If I were you , sir , I 'd keep quiet
Your life 's at stake , in case you didn 't know it
Who are you ?
I have the dubious honor of being your defense counsel
But I 'm afraid it won 't be much use to you
But , but ...
Do you want to kill me ?
Murder me , just like that ? We just want to render you harmless
But you 'll only be that way when you are dead
But if you kill me , it 'll be cold-blooded murder !
I demand that you hand me over to the police
I demand to be handed over to the jurisdiction of common law
That would suit you , wouldn 't it ? Then you 'll invoke paragraph 51 And spend the rest of your life in an institution at state expense
And then you 'd escape , or else get a pardon , then there you are , free as air , with a law-protected pass because of mental illness , off again , chasing little girls
We 're not going to let that happen
We must make you powerless .
You must disappear Yes , disappear !
I can 't help what I do
I can 't help it , I can 't ...
The old story , we never can help it in court
What do you know about it ?
Who are you anyway ?
Who are you ?
Criminals ?
Are you proud of yourselves ? Proud of breaking safes or cheating at cards ?
Things you could just as well keep your fingers off
You wouldn 't need to do all that if you 'd learn a proper trade or if you 'd work .
If you weren 't a bunch of lazy bastards But I ... I can 't help myself !
I have no control over this this evil thing inside me , the fire , the voices , the torment !
You mean to say that you have to murder ?
It 's there all the time , driving me out to wander the streets following me , silently , but I can feel it there
It 's me , pursuing myself
I want to escape , to escape from myself !
But it 's impossible I can 't escape .
I have to obey it . I have to run ... endless streets
I want to escape , to get away
And I 'm pursued by ghosts . Ghosts of mothers And of those children ...
They are there , always there ...
Always , except when I do it
Then I can 't remember anything And afterwards I see those posters and read what I 've done
Did I do that ?
But I can 't remember anything about it
But who will believe me ?
Who knows what it 's like to be me ?
How I 'm forced to act ... How I must ...
Must ... Don 't want to
Don 't want to , but must ! And then ... a voice screams I can 't bear to hear it
The accused has said that he cannot help himself
That is to say , he has to murder .
As this is the case he has pronounced his own death sentence Someone who admits to being a compulsive murderer should be snuffed out , like a candle
This man must be wiped out , eliminated
I wish to speak
The defense lawyer will speak
Our very honorable president , who is , I believe , wanted by the police for three murders -
That 's got nothing to do with it ... claims that because my client acts under an irresistible impulse he is condemned to death
He is right ! He is mistaken .
Because it is that very fact that clears him
Just a minute , enough !
Mad old drunk !
Is this very obsession which makes my client not responsible
And nobody can be punished for something he can 't help - Ridiculous !
- Do you suggest that this brute should get off ?
I mean this man is sick .
A sick man should be handed over not to the executioner , but to the doctor
Can you promise he 'd be cured ?
What use are asylums , then ?
And what would happen if he escaped ?
Yes .
Or if they released him as harmless ? And what if the compulsion to kill returns ?
Another man-hunt for months Paragraph 51 again . The asylum , then another escape or release
Then the compulsion all over again , and so on , and on
No one can kill a man who isn 't responsible for his actions Not the state , and certainly not you
The state must see that this man becomes harmless and no longer is a danger to his fellow citizens
You 've never had children , huh ?
So you haven 't lost any But if you knew what it 's like to lose one ...
Go ask the parents ! Ask them what those days and nights were like when they didn 't know what had happened . And then when they finally knew
Do you think they 'll have mercy ?
- She 's right . - I 'll say she is
- No mercy ! No pardon !
- Give the murderer to us
Kill the beast ! - Crush the brute ! - Kill him !
All that won 't silence me
I won 't allow a crime to be committed in my presence
I demand that this man ... that this man be granted the protection of the law
I demand that this man be handed over to the police
- To the police ! - Filthy stooge
In the name of the law
In the name of the people
This won 't bring back our children
We , too , should keep a closer watch on our children
- What is it ?
- Sorry to have to report ... there are four stowaways in the forward hatch .
Stowaways ?
How do you know there are four of them ?
They were singing Sweet Adeline .
Get them out of there , you hear ?
But we can 't find them .
And besides , they 've been writing insulting notes .
So , I 'm an old goat , am I ?
Listen to me .
Find them if you have to clear out that whole hatch !
Yes , sir .
- Captain , when do we get in ?
- Wednesday !
- I beg your pardon .
Wednesday .
- Thank you .
GROUCHO : [ Singing ] In all my dreams STOWAWAYS : [ Singing ] In all my dreams
GROUCHO : Your fair face beams STOWAWAYS :
You 're the idol of my heart Your fair face beams
ALL :
Sweet Adeline
My Adeline
This is the only way to travel , boys .
The only way .
I was gonna bring the wife and kiddies ... but the grocer couldn 't spare another barrel .
I was gonna bring my grandfather , but there 's no room for his beard .
Why not send for the old swine , let his beard come later ?
- I sent for his beard .
- You did ?
It 's coming by " hair " mail .
Fellas , I think I hear someone .
If it 's the captain , I 'm gonna have a few words with him .
My hot water 's been cold for three days and I haven 't got room to swing a cat .
In fact , I haven 't even got a cat .
- My grandfather can swing a cat .
- He can ?
That 'd make a good job for him .
GIBSON : Come on , men .
Someone 's coming .
Come on , men .
Snap it up .
Listen , fellas .
We 've got to find those stowaways .
- And when we do , we 'll put them in irons .
- Aye , aye , sir .
Take a look in behind those cases .
You fellows , look behind those boxes .
- Never mind the barrels .
- Aye , aye , sir .
- What 's that ?
- I just said " aye , aye , sir . "
- Never mind that .
Find those men . - Aye , aye , sir .
- They 're not here , sir .
- Oh , yes , they are .
Hoist all this stuff up on deck .
- And get these barrels out of the way .
- Very well , sir .
Lower away up there .
Hurry up with that sling .
- You 'll never find them standing around .
- Yes , sir .
You look in back of those bales .
OFFICER : You look in those boxes .
SAILOR : Yes , sir .
All right , boys .
Make it snappy up there !
GIBSON : Hey !
There they are !
CHICO : Hurry .
You fellas , go aft .
You fellas , take a look in behind those lifeboats .
WOMAN : Captain , tell us about the stowaways .
I 'll have them in the brig before long .
That 's terribly romantic .
I 'd love to meet a stowaway .
CAPTAIN : Hey , you .
Are these your gloves ?
I found them in your trunk .
- Go to your rooms .
I 'll be down shortly .
- Who are you ?
Are you the floorwalker ?
I want to register a complaint .
- What 's the matter ?
- Matter enough .
You know who sneaked into my stateroom at 3 : 00 a.m. ?
- Who did that ?
- Nobody , and that 's my complaint .
I 'm young .
I want gaiety , laughter , ha-cha-cha .
I wanna dance .
[ Singing ] I wanna dance till the cows come home
Just what do you mean by this ?
I don 't like the way you 're running this boat .
Get in the backseat and let your wife drive .
CAPTAIN : I 've been captain of this ship for 22 years .
Twenty-two years ?
If you were a man , you 'd go in business for yourself .
I know a fellow , started last year with a canoe .
He has more women than you can shake a stick at , if you enjoy that .
One more word , and I 'll throw you in irons .
You can 't do it with irons .
It 's a mashie shot .
It 's a mashie shot if the wind is against you .
If the wind isn 't , I am .
How about those barrels down below ?
GROUCHO : I wouldn 't put a pig in there .
CAPTAIN : See here , you ...
Not even if you got down on your knees .
And here 's your gloves .
You would take them , wouldn 't you ?
And keep away from my office .
CAPTAIN : Now , see here , you !
How dare you invade the sanctity of the captain 's quarters ?
I thought you was the captain .
I 'm hungry .
I 'm gonna find something to eat .
I 'll take care of that . Hello .
- Send up the captain 's lunch .
- Two .
Send up his dinner , too . Who am I ?
I 'm the captain . You want to choose up sides ?
Engineer , will you tell them to stop the boat from rocking ?
I 'm gonna have lunch .
- What 's the matter with you ?
- What 's the matter with me ?
I 'm hungry . - I didn 't eat in three days .
- Three days ?
- We 've only been on the boat two days .
- I didn 't eat yesterday ... I didn 't eat today , and I won 't eat tomorrow .
That makes three days .
State your business .
I 've got to shiver my timbers .
I got no business .
I come up to see the captain 's bridge .
Captain 's bridge ?
I 'm sorry .
He always keeps it in a glass ... while he 's eating . Would you like to see where he sleeps ?
I saw that .
That 's the bunk .
You 're wasting your breath , and that 's no great loss .
A fine sailor you are .
You bet I 'm a fine sailor .
You know , my whole family was sailors ?
My father was partners with Columbus .
What do you think of that ?
- Your father and Columbus were partners ?
- You bet . Columbus has been dead 400 years .
They told me it was my father .
Hop up there , and I 'll show you a few things you don 't know about history .
Now look .
There 's Columbus .
That 's Columbus Circle .
Would you mind getting up off that flypaper and giving the flies a chance ?
You 're crazy . Flies can 't read papers .
Now , Columbus sailed from Spain to India looking for a shortcut .
You mean strawberry shortcut .
I don 't know .
When I woke up , there was the nurse taking care of me .
What 's the matter ?
Couldn 't the nurse take care of herself ?
You bet she could , but I found it out too late .
Enough of this .
Let 's get back to Columbus .
- I 'd rather get back to the nurse .
- So would I.
But Columbus was sailing along on his vessel .
- On his what ?
- Not on his what .
On his vessel .
- Don 't you know what " vessel " is ? - Sure . I can vessel .
[ Chico whistling lively tune ]
Do you suppose I could buy back my introduction to you ?
Now , one night Columbus ' sailors started a mutiny .
No mutinies at night .
They 're in the afternoon .
You know , mutinies Wednesdays and Saturdays .
There 's my argument .
Restrict immigration . [ Gibson talking indistinctly ]
All right .
Of all the colossal impudence !
Why don 't you stand up ?
Can 't you see he has no chair ?
- Why , you ...
- You better keep quiet .
We 're a couple of big stockholders in this company .
Stockholders ?
You look like a couple of stowaways to me .
Don 't forget that the stockholder of yesteryear is the stowaway of today .
Well , you look exactly like them .
What do they look like ?
One of them goes around with a black moustache .
So do I. If I had my choice , I 'd go around with a little blonde .
I said one goes around with a black moustache .
You couldn 't expect a moustache to go around by itself .
Don 't you think a moustache ever gets lonely , Captain ?
CHICO : Sure , it gets lonely .
When my grandfather 's beard gets here , I 'd like it to meet your moustache .
I 'll think it over .
I 'll talk it over with my moustache .
Has your grandfather 's beard got any money ?
- Money ?
Why , it fell hair to a fortune .
- Now , listen !
Stockholders or no stockholders , you clear out of here !
[ Knock on door ]
CHICO : There 's someone in that room .
GROUCHO : There 's somebody in that closet , and I think it 's you , Captain . - Now , we can eat in peace .
- All right .
Here 's a piece for you .
That a baby . [ Knock on door ]
- Beg pardon , Captain .
- How dare you enter the captain 's quarters ...
- while I 'm eating . - Sorry , sir .
[ Knocking on door ]
Now I 've got you !
Don 't forget the butter .
You know , there 's some mighty pretty country around here .
- I 've ...
- I beg your pardon .
- Pardon me . Is this yours ? - Why , no .
- You sure ? - I 'm positive .
- Is this yours ?
- Yes , it is .
As I was saying , there 's some mighty beautiful country around here .
- The trees are lovely . - You bet they are .
I love them .
Get out of my way !
Gibson . Come out of there .
Yes , sir .
I want to report I found a ...
Gibson , you 've been drinking again ... and you know what my orders were .
But those stowaways , I just caught one of them in there .
- Stowaway , huh ? - Yes .
There he is .
PUPPETEER : [ ln falsetto ] Help !
Look out ! You 're choking me !
I thought so .
Go to your quarters . [ Children laughing ]
That 's one now .
That 's a dummy .
Come with me .
First officer .
I 'm telling you , that 's him .
This has gone far enough . Get up to your quarters .
[ Captain screams ]
Yes , sir . [ Children laughing ]
Quiet .
I think you 're right .
I know you 're right . [ Puppeteer shouting indistinctly ]
Would you like anything before lunch ?
Yes , breakfast .
Nobody eats in here .
I do .
Mustard 's no good without roast beef .
Do you want your nails trimmed long ?
About an hour and a half .
I got nothing to do .
You 're a nice-looking gal , all right .
You got it .
Thank you .
And you can keep it .
That 's a nice gal ? Somebody 's coming .
Come on , boys .
You 're next , Cap .
I 'm looking for a couple of mugs .
- No , you boys look on B Deck .
- Aye , aye , sir .
How about a shave ?
- Sure .
Give me a once-over . - Once-over , partner .
OFFICER : No , a shave . CHICO :
On the face .
All right .
- Wake me up when you get through . - We 'll take care of you , all right .
We take the tonsils last .
I think we work on the moustache first .
Give him a little snoop .
CHICO : This side 's too long . Give him a little snoop this side .
CHICO : Now this side is too short . CHICO :
It 's too short .
The other side is too long .
Snoop him up .
That 's better , but the side that was too short now is too long ... and the side that was too long is too short .
I think you got to give him one more snoop .
I think we better measure .
It 's about a foot too much .
No , the measure 's a foot too much . Now it looks much better .
CHICO : It can stand one more snoop in the middle , I think .
In the middle , one snoop . That 's fine .
That 's very good .
I think it 's a little bit rough right here .
I fix that .
You know , I 'm never going on this boat again .
The food is no good .
Of course , I no eat yet , but even if I don 't eat , I like the food good .
One more snoop .
That 's beautiful ?
That 's what you call a work of art .
Hey , you know , I think you give him one snoop too much . And I want you to know , I 'm fed up on your alibis .
Take it easy .
You 're getting all excited .
Now where do you think you 're going ?
Never mind .
I 'm running this racket .
Just stay here and keep out of sight like I told you .
No you don 't .
Now , listen to me , Mr. Alky Briggs .
You can 't keep me cooped up like this .
I 've played second fiddle on this ship long enough .
Now you listen .
I 'm not after any dames .
I 'm after Joe Helton , I tell you , and he can 't get away from me on this boat .
He 's got to put his okay on my gang , or he 's gonna get this .
Hey , who are you ?
I 'm the tailor .
That reminds me .
Where are my pants ?
You 've got them on .
Pardon me while I step into the closet .
And get a load of this , if you come in again at 3 : 00 a. m ...
- Stop bothering me .
Tell it to the tailor . - Alky !
Alky !
LUCILLE : What are you doing in there ?
Nothing . Come on in .
LUCILLE : You can 't stay in that closet .
GROUCHO : I can 't , can I ?
That 's what they said to Thomas Edison , mighty inventor ... Thomas Lindbergh , mighty flier , and Thomas Shefsky , mighty like a rose .
Just remember that if there weren 't any closets , there wouldn 't be any hooks ... and if there weren 't any hooks , there 'd be no fish , and that would suit me fine . LUCILLE :
Don 't try to hide .
I know you 're in that closet .
- Did you see me go in the closet ?
- No .
- Am I in the closet now ?
- No .
Then how do you know I was in the closet ? Your Honour , I rest my case .
Come here , brown eyes .
You 're not gonna get me off this bed .
I didn 't know you were a lawyer .
You 're awfully shy for a lawyer .
You bet I 'm shy .
I 'm a shyster lawyer .
Then what do you think of an egg that would give me ...
You 've been getting nothing but dirty breaks .
We can clean and tighten your brakes ... but you 'll have to stay in the garage all night .
I want excitement . I want to ha-cha-cha-cha .
You don 't realise it .
From the time he got the marriage license , I 've led a dog 's life .
Are you sure he didn 't get a dog 's license ?
Alky can 't make a fool of me .
I want to go places . I want to do things .
I want freedom , I want liberty , I want justice ! [ Groucho humming ]
Madam , you 're making history .
In fact , you 're making me .
And I wish you 'd keep my hands to yourself .
You know what I want .
I want life , I want laughter , I want gaiety .
I want to ha-cha-cha-cha .
Madam , before I get through with you , you will have a clear case for divorce ... and so will my wife .
The first thing to do is to arrange for a settlement .
You take the children , your husband takes the house .
Junior burns the house , you take the insurance and I take you .
LUCILLE : But I haven 't any children .
That 's the trouble with this country .
You haven 't any children .
And as for me , I 'm going back in the closet where men are empty overcoats .
LUCILLE : Brown eyes .
Sir , this is an outrage , breaking into a man 's home .
There 'll be a letter about this in the Times tomorrow morning .
Yeah ?
But you won 't read it , 'cause I 'm gonna lay you out pretty .
You 're gonna lay me out pretty ?
That 's the thanks I get for freeing an innocent girl ... who , although she is hiding at the moment ... has promised to become the mother of her children .
And with that , sir , I bid you a fond farewell .
Good day , sir .
Good day .
Come out of there .
I want to talk to you .
I 'm sorry , but we 're using the old-fashioned iceman ... and we find him very satisfactory for keeping the house warm .
Just as I thought , you 're yellow , grabbing at a woman 's skirts .
- I 'm wise .
- You 're wise ?
What 's the capital of Nebraska ?
What 's the capital of the Chase National Bank ?
Give up ? Now , I 'll try you on an easy one .
How many Frenchmen can 't be wrong ?
- I know ...
- You were warm and so was she .
Don 't be discouraged .
With a little study you 'll go a long way .
- And I 'd wish you 'd start now .
- Do you see this gat ?
Cute , isn 't it ?
Santa Claus bring it for Christmas ?
I got a fire engine .
Listen , mug .
Do you know who I am ?
Don 't tell me .
Are you animal or vegetable ? Animal .
- Get this .
I 'm Alky Briggs .
- And I 'm the fellow who talks so much .
Fancy meeting you here after all these drinks .
- Wait a minute .
- Sorry , I can 't stay .
The captain 's waiting to chase me .
You can stay , all right , until I finish with you .
Alky , darling , please !
Don 't " darling " me .
Get in that next room and stay there !
Get in that next room .
I 'm not good enough for her , am I ?
Is there anything you 've got to say before I drill you ?
- Yes , I 'd like to ask you one question .
- Go ahead .
Do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed ?
Don 't you think that although girls go out with boys like me ... they always marry the other kind ?
If you 're gonna kill me , hurry up .
I have to take my tonic at 2 : 00 .
I can use a guy with your nerve .
I think we could get along well together .
Of course , the first year we might have our little squabbles .
But , then , that 's inevitable , don 't you think ?
And what do you want here ?
I was just looking for him .
Do you know this guy ?
I 've known him for years .
He used to live in the next barrel to me .
I see .
The stowaways .
I can help you bozos .
- Mr. Bozos to you .
- All right , Mr. Bozo .
And you can help me .
I 'm shorthanded , and I want to get a guy on this boat .
It 's too late to get him on now . Should 've said so before we sailed .
Listen .
This is a map of B Deck .
There 's Joe Helton 's stateroom .
And he 's a tough egg .
And you 're coming with me ... while I have it out with Joe .
Do you know who Joe Helton is ?
I think I 'll get off this boat until this blows over .
If you know what 's good for you , you 'll stick with me .
You keep the windows covered while I go in . Now , move !
What is the idea of this ?
It 's all right .
I make a move for you .
MAN 1 : This is an outrage !
MAN 2 : I 'll call the captain !
- The captain don 't play chess .
- Purser !
- Steward !
Come here .
- Too much noise here for us .
We better go someplace where it 's quiet . [ Knock on door ]
Come in .
BELLBOY : Your cigars , sir . JOE :
Wait a minute .
Thank you , sir .
Dad , now look at you .
You aren 't even dressed yet .
You can do all the dressing for the family , Mary .
Old Joe Helton is taking things easy for the rest of his life .
We 're big shots now , baby .
[ Knock on door ] Come in .
- Hello , Joe .
- Hello , Briggs .
What do you want ?
I just wanted to have a friendly talk .
I 'm sort of worried about business .
Step in the other room , baby .
- But , Dad ... - Run along , honey .
Your kid ?
She 's cute , isn 't she ?
I don 't think we 've got anything to talk about . Get out .
Not before I get your okay on my gang .
- I 'm not doing you any favours . - Yes , you are .
You 're gonna sign this .
I 'm taking over your territory , or there 's gonna be trouble .
I 'm taking no sides .
You 'll have to fight it out with Butch and the gang .
I 'm stepping into your shoes as boss .
I 'm not backing up any small-time chiseller .
ALKY : Don 't put on the Ritz with me .
JOE : Don 't get cocky with me , Briggs .
ALKY : I 'm talking turkey .
You can 't make all the dough and then run out on your pals .
I 'm not taking orders from a mug like you ! Scram !
So that 's your answer ? Here 's mine !
[ Horn tooting ]
So you got your gang with you ?
I 'll get you later .
Who are you guys ?
What are you doing in my room ?
That 's my partner , but he no speak . He 's dumb and deaf .
You guys don 't know it , but you just scared a pretty tough egg out of this room .
Sure , we 're a couple of tough guys .
- Do you want to make some money ? - Money ?
[ Chico guffaws ]
Money ?
Feel this muscle . Feel his muscle . All right .
How much you pay ?
Just how tough are you ?
You pay little bit , we 're little bit tough .
You pay very much , very much tough .
You pay too much , we 're too much tough .
- How much you pay ?
- I pay plenty .
Then we 're plenty tough . And we show you , too .
Partner , show him how tough we are . See ?
That 's nothing .
That 's free .
Now we give you the real stuff this time .
CHICO : Come on .
Put some pep in it .
The one-two uppercut . You know , on the button .
No downstairs button .
Upstairs button .
That 's fine .
That 's good , all right .
I tell him you 're tough , and you punch like a lily .
What 's a matter ?
You wanna lose this job ?
Give him the stuff this time .
Excuse me , boss . He can do much better ... but he no work good today .
He no get paid .
When he get paid , you watch him .
Come on . This time we give him the works .
Come on . Hurry up .
On the button this time .
Come on , I tell you . On the button .
CHICO : Hurry up . Give me the punch .
Come on .
CHICO : All right .
Come on ! Punch !
That 's enough . Wait .
- What do you think of us ?
- You 're great .
Not so loud .
You want him to get a swell head ?
You guys are plenty tough , all right .
I 'm spying on you .
You 're just the fellows I need . You 're hired .
CHICO : We 're great , huh ? JOE :
You 're great .
CHICO : My partner ? JOE :
He 's great .
My grandfather 's great . He 's a great-grandfather .
When Helton comes out of his room , plug him .
- What 'll we plug him with ?
- Didn 't I give you two gats ?
We had to drown the gat , but we saved you a little black gitten .
Here , take these , and hang onto them now . Don 't leave me for a minute .
And keep your eye on that guy that just went out of here .
You understand .
Anybody come near the boss , let him have it .
You 're all right now , boss .
Anybody comes near you ...
What 's a matter with you ?
Look out .
That 's all right .
He was just practicing .
Get out .
Now I can take a walk out on deck and feel safe . Come on . Let 's go .
There he comes now .
Get him . Don 't worry . We 'll get him .
I 've got my finger on the trigger .
Hey , don 't forget .
Anybody comes near the boss , let him have it .
[ Chico laughs ] It 's the boss .
He 's got a disguise .
Take off the whiskers .
We know you .
[ Screams ] What do you mean ?
Officer !
Why didn 't you get him ?
Not afraid , are you ?
Afraid ?
A man who 's licked his weight ... in wild caterpillars ? Me ?
Afraid ?
You bet I 'm afraid . - So ...
- Hello .
How are things in the closet ?
You know , I still smell of mothballs .
I don 't want to talk to you . [ Groucho humming dramatic dance music ]
So here you are , loafing around with these tramps .
I came down to see Joe Helton .
- Don 't you think we 'd better go ?
- What ? And leave this woman alone with her husband ?
Suppose her sweetheart came in .
Alky Briggs , don 't think you can keep me cooped up in that stateroom .
Because you 're crazy !
You 'll stay down there and keep out of my business .
Do you understand ?
- Keep out of my business .
- Your turn .
You were going to show me a good time .
A good time !
I might as well have stayed home and played solitaire !
Your turn .
Pipe down .
I 've more important things than you to worry about .
Your turn .
You say that again and I 'll scratch your eyes out !
You take this gun . You 're gonna need it more than I will .
Oh , you !
Just the man I wanna see .
If I show you how to save 20 % ... would you be interested ?
Of course you would .
First , your overhead is too high and your brow is too low .
Interested already , aren 't you ?
Wait till I get through .
- I haven 't got time .
- Two fellows are trying to attack you ... and two fellows are trying to defend you .
Now , that 's 50 % waste .
Why can 't you be attacked by your bodyguards ?
Your life will be saved , and that 's 100 % waste .
Now what have you got ?
Me , and I 'll attack you for nothing .
- What are you getting at ?
- I anticipated that .
How does an army travel ?
On its stomach .
And you ?
On a ship .
Of course , you 're saving your stomach .
- The same common sense ...
- I don 't think you realise ...
I realise it 's a penny here and there , but look at me .
I 've worked myself up from nothing to extreme poverty .
What do you say ?
- I 'll tell you what I say ...
- Then it 's all settled .
I 'm to be your new bodyguard .
In case I attack you ... I 'll be there to defend you , too .
When you want to be attacked , I 'll defend you 10 minutes later .
I 've already got two bodyguards , but I 'll think it over .
- Thank you .
- You 're welcome .
- What 's the matter with you ?
- I 've got a frog in my throat .
- What ?
- A frog in my throat .
- You 've got a frog in your throat . - Yes .
You can 't do that to my customers !
Cut it out !
Say , what 's the matter with you ?
Are you crazy or something ?
Have your landing cards and passports ready , please . - How do you do , Madame Swempski ?
- Hello , boys .
- Any statement for the press ?
- No , I 'm afraid not .
Nothing of interest on this tour .
Is it true the opera is on the decline in Central Europe ?
Absurd .
I predict they 're going to have the greatest year they 've ever had .
Is it true that you 're gonna get married again while on this tour ?
- Gentlemen , I don 't know what to say .
- Gentlemen , I 'd say just this .
The bicycle will never replace the horse .
But , the horse will never replace the bicycle ... which is quite a horse on the bicycle if I ever saw one , and I never did .
I dare you to print that , you muckrakers .
- Have a cigar , babe .
- Okay for the picture , Joe .
Pictures ?
Here 's a little sex stuff for your front page .
Now , hold it steady , please . [ Horn tooting ]
You can say it was a real love match .
We married for money .
Eh , my shrinking violet ?
It won 't hurt you to shrink 30 or 40 pounds .
You impudent cad !
- I 'll report you to your paper .
- Let me do the reporting .
Is it true you 'll get a divorce as soon as your husband recovers his sight ?
Is it true you wash your hair in clam broth ?
- Is it true you danced in a flea circus ?
- This is outrageous !
- lf you don 't stop , I 'll call the captain .
- So that 's it .
Infatuated with a pretty uniform .
We don 't count .
We gave you our best years , now you want an officer .
I don 't like this innuendo .
That 's what I always say , love flies out the door when money comes innuendo .
Good-bye .
It 's nice to have seen you , but I 've got nobody to blame but myself .
REPORTER : Could you tell me ... SWEMPSKl :
Please ...
You 're awfully glum .
I was just thinking , after the boat lands , I may never see you again .
Does it matter to you whether you ever see me again ?
I can 't think of anything in the world that matters more .
Mary , I 'll never leave you . [ Soft romantic instrumental music ]
SAILOR : Tag . SAILOR :
Wait a minute !
I 'm just trying to sneak off the boat , that 's all .
I 'm looking for the man who owns ...
Where 's your passport ?
GROUCHO : Wait a minute .
Let me handle this .
I don 't like to speak about it , Officer , but I happen to be ... a good friend of the meat supplier to this boat .
- Well ?
- Well , do you like lamb chops ?
- Yes , what of it ?
- This man doesn 't handle lamb chops .
But the roast beef is very good today .
You fellows can 't get off the boat without showing passports .
Get on back there at the end of the line and get your passports open .
CAPTAIN : Go on . Get back there .
Stuffed shirt .
He gives you service . [ Thudding ]
It looks like we 're up against it .
It 's up to you to get us a passport . I got you , didn 't I ?
Well , you 'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to steal from me .
He did get up early this morning , but you weren 't here .
Perhaps tomorrow ?
Well , come on .
Let 's try another one .
What 's the idea , putting your hand in my pocket ?
Just a little mistake .
I had a suit that looked just like that and I thought those were my pants .
How could they be yours , when I 've got them on ?
This suit had two pairs of pants .
Better keep your hands to yourself .
Do you know who 's on this boat ?
Maurice Chevalier , the movie actor .
- I just ran into him .
- Did you hurt him ?
- How do you know it was Chevalier ?
- I got his passport right there .
Now he can 't get off the boat .
Hey , he looks like Chevalier .
And I can look like Chevalier .
- I certainly look like Chevalier .
- But that 's not enough .
You have to sing his song to get off this boat .
[ Singing ] If a nightingale could sing like you
They 'd sing much better than you do
Dandy .
Sing like that , they 'll throw us all off the boat .
- Well , let 's try it .
- All right .
Come on .
Have your passports ready .
Straight out ... you 'll find the baggage on the deck . Have your passports ready .
Keep in line , everybody . 945 .
INSPECTOR : Keep in line , everybody .
Have your passports ready .
INSPECTOR : 1092 .
INSPECTOR : Never mind .
Hey , if you want to get off the boat ...
- get in the back .
- Oh , I didn 't get on in the back .
- I got on in the front .
- Never mind that .
INSPECTOR : Leave them alone .
ZEPPO : You 're right ...
- I told them to stay in line .
- Yeah ?
Show me your passport .
- Yeah , right here .
That 's my name .
- Maurice Chevalier ?
Yeah .
- This picture doesn 't look like you .
- Sure , I 'm Maurice Chevalier .
I 'll sing for you .
[ Singing ] If a nightingale could sing like you
They 'd sing much better than they do
Here , never mind that .
Get back in line where you belong .
I was ahead of you ! INSPECTOR :
Your passport .
Let me have your passport .
This picture doesn 't look like you .
It don 't look like me from the front , but go in the back of the boat , just like me .
You 're not Maurice Chevalier .
- Are you Maurice Chevalier ?
- No .
Well , there you are .
Wait . I prove it .
[ Singing ] If a nightingale could sing like you
He sing much better than you do and
Out !
- No push me !
- Get out of here !
Get back in line where you belong . Passport !
- This picture doesn 't look like you .
- It doesn 't look like you either .
- This man has no moustache .
- The barbershop wasn 't open .
- Why , look at that face .
- Well , look at that face .
Hey , are you going to identify yourself , or else ...
[ Singing ] If a nightingale could sing like you
They 'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me Out !
Back in line where you belong !
OFFICER 1 : Get off there !
OFFICER 2 : Get off the table !
OFFICER 1 : What do you think this is here ?
OFFICER 1 : Put that down !
OFFICER 2 : Lunatic !
OFFICER 1 : Stop that !
OFFICER 2 : You want to break that ?
OFFICER 3 : Here , let it alone !
Passport . I said passport , not pasteboard .
Come on with that passport !
Not washboard !
Passport !
INSPECTOR : Chevalier ?
If a nightingale could sing like you
They 'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me
And if the sandman brought me dreams of you
I 'd want to dream my whole life through
For you brought a new kind of love to me
INSPECTOR : Get him out of here !
- Put him back there where he belongs !
- Take it easy , folks .
The gangplank is to the left , please .
Don 't crowd . Don 't crowd .
- Take your time .
Ladies first .
- Let me off the boat .
I 'm a sick man .
- I feel faint .
- I don 't care , take your time .
I tell you , I feel faint .
I 'm going to faint . SWEMPSKl :
Someone get a doctor ! MAN :
Somebody fainted .
Where 's a doctor ?
A doctor !
I want a doctor !
She 's sick .
We 'll take care of you .
Look , she 's got a chill , cover her up . No , get off .
Take her pulse .
No purse , put it back .
Pulse .
I think you best take her temperature .
That 's good , we 'll take care of you , lady . All right .
You fools , I 'm not the patient .
We 're not the doctor .
Come on .
Doctor !
Is there a doctor on the boat ? Doctor !
- Are you a doctor ?
- Sure , I 'm a doctor .
Where 's the horse ?
- A man fainted over here .
- Man fainted ?
I 'll soon fix him .
Just my hard luck it couldn 't be a woman . MAN :
Here 's the doctor .
Just as I thought , smoking too much .
Here he is here , Doctor .
Don 't tell me . I 'll find him myself .
[ People murmuring ]
I can 't do anything for that man .
He 's fainted .
What he needs is an ocean voyage .
In the meantime , get him off the boat and have his baggage examined .
MAN :
Gangway ! You all get close so he won 't recover .
Right this way , please . Step right around here .
OFFICER : Step lively down there .
Back that ambulance in here !
Helton 's throwing his party tonight , and this time we blow the works .
Now , you guys are going in as musicians .
And stay that way until I give you the office .
Say , what about those four guys in the house ?
The ones you said were on the boat .
Don 't worry about them . They eat out of my hand .
The thing for you to worry about is that girl .
Keep your eye on her . Get me ?
That ought be easy to take .
Okay .
Sit tight and I 'll give you a call .
Have you guys got an invitation ?
We give you invitation of Chevalier .
[ Singing ] When the nightingale sings like you
Cut it out !
And stay away from this door , see ?
ZEPPO : Mary ?
You certainly had me worried .
I thought you 'd forgotten your own party .
You haven 't been doing all the worrying .
I was afraid you wouldn 't come .
My , but , there are a lot of strange-looking people here .
Ladies and gentlemen !
Quiet , everybody .
A lady 's diamond earring has been lost .
It looks exactly like this .
In fact , this is it . I beg your pardon !
How about you and I passing out on the veranda ?
Or would you rather pass out here ?
Sir , you have the advantage of me .
Not yet , but wait till I get you outside .
You 're pretty fresh , aren 't you ?
That 's my wife and I don 't like the way you 're acting here .
If you don 't like our country , go back where you came from .
I should sink that right in your scalp .
- Run for your life !
The Indians are coming !
- What ?
Put your scalp in your pocket . Here . The Indians .
[ Groucho whooping ]
- Come here . - I 'll get him .
[ Groucho whooping ]
Have a good time , kid .
This is going to be a real party .
Is this a party ?
The beer is warm , the women are cold ... and I 'm hot under the collar .
In fact , a more poisonous little barbecue I 've never attended .
You 're a funny kind of a duck , but I like you .
You stuck by me , and I 'll stick by you .
Sheriff , I ain 't much on flowery sentiments ... but there 's something I just got to tell you .
Shucks , man , I 'd be nothing but a poisonous varmint ... and not fit to touch the hem of your pants ... if I didn 't tell you you 've treated me square , mighty square ... and I ain 't forgetting .
Sheriff , I ain 't forgetting .
GROUCHO : Whoa , there , Bossie . Whoa , there !
My friends , this is indeed a surprise .
You couldn 't have pleased me better .
I want you to meet the sweetest little thing in the whole wide world . [ Guests applauding ]
GROUCHO :
Hey . WAITER : Yes , sir ?
No , it 's special for Mr. Helton , sir .
You see this ?
Come back in a half hour , and I 'll give you another look at it .
Listen .
Keep your eye on Helton .
We 're gonna grab his daughter and take her to the old barn .
Old barn ?
A fine tinhorn sport you are .
With all the good shows in town , taking a girl to an old barn !
Once we get a hold of that girl , he 'll take orders from me .
- I 'll show him ...
- Enough small talk .
- Where 's your wife , Lucille ?
- Would you ...
Someone 's coming .
I 'll be back .
Be back next Thursday , and bring a specimen of your handwriting .
And , above all , don 't worry .
What brought you here ?
It 's midsummer madness .
The music is in my temples ... the hot blood of youth .
Come , Kapellmeister .
Let the violas throb .
My regiment leaves at dawn .
I guess my regiment can go without me .
No , don 't , my husband might be inside .
If he finds me out here , he 'll wallop me .
Always thinking of your husband .
Couldn 't I wallop you just as well ?
I heard Alky talking about this party .
I 've dreamed of a night like this , I tell you .
You tell me about some of your dreams .
Dreams ?
I can 't even sleep anymore , wondering who he 's chasing around with .
Why can 't we break away from all this , just you and I ... and lodge with my fleas in the hills ?
I mean , flee to my lodge in the hills .
No , I couldn 't think of it .
Don 't be afraid .
You can join this lodge for a few pennies .
You won 't even have to take a physical examination ... unless you insist on one .
What a swell home life I 've got .
Why , I think I 'd almost marry you to spite that double-crossing crook . Mrs. Briggs ...
I 've known and respected your husband Alky for many years ... and what 's good enough for him is good enough for me .
Emily !
Henry , carefully , somebody may see us .
I 've been careful too long .
Now that you 've brought it up , how long have you been careful ?
- They saw us !
- Be calm , Emily .
I 'll talk to them .
You won 't say anything about this ?
Sir , are you trying to offer me a bribe ?
How much ?
But you don 't understand .
You see , I 'm not happy with my husband .
He should 've married some little housewife .
Madam , I resent that .
Some of my best friends are housewives . [ Clears throat ]
Now , see here , if you 're going to ...
You 're living in a fool 's paradise .
You intend to spend $ 10 to buy this woman a ring ?
Look at this .
It 's solid brass and $ 1.50 takes it away .
I know it 'll fit her .
I got it from the nose of a savage .
Well ?
$ 1.50 .
You can have it for $ 1 .
Fifty cents and not a nickel under .
Now , my friends , what am I offered for this fine French piece of bric-a-brac ?
I know what it is to be unhappy .
How do you think I feel ?
I 'm stuck with this ring .
I 've been married for four years , four years of neglect ... four years of battling , four years of heartbreaks .
That makes 12 years .
You must 've been married in rompers .
Mighty pretty country around there .
Do you think you 'll ever go back ?
Come here , babe . I like you .
I shouldn 't .
What about my husband ?
That 's all right .
Maybe we can get a girl for him .
Who was that ?
My wife ?
Married to her 12 years and you ask me ?
What 're you doing here ?
I told you to spy on Helton .
- I did spy on him .
- What was he doing ?
- He was spying on me .
- Did he see you ?
No . I was too foxy for him .
All he could do was spy on me .
Well , get back in there .
We 're all set to cop his girl .
Okay , chief .
They got some good stuff outside . You want a drink ?
Ready , boys ? Let 's go .
[ Band playing slow music ]
Beat you that time .
- Very swell .
Let me get you some punch . - I 'd love it .
Just what I needed .
Well , how 's it coming , kid ?
- Got everything you want ?
- Sure , how about a job for my grandfather ?
JOE :
Your grandfather , what does he do ?
He puts cheese in the mousetraps .
Why , we haven 't got any mice here .
He brings his own mice with him . [ Joe laughs ]
You know , Mary , everyone seems to be having nearly as much fun as I am .
I beg your pardon , but there 's someone to see you , Miss Helton .
- Pardon me , and I 'll hurry right back . - Surely .
No , you 're wrong , girls , you 're wrong .
In the first place , Gary Cooper is much taller than I am .
I wish you 'd announce this singer .
I can 't make out the name .
Ladies and gentlemen , I wish to announce ... that the buffet will be served in the next room in five minutes .
To get you in that room quickly ...
Mrs. Schmalhausen will sing a soprano solo in this room .
[ Singing a slow opera song ]
That 's no good .
You wanna get thrown out again ?
Play something nice .
I tell you what you play .
Play ...
That 's it .
That 's beautiful .
That 's magnifico . I like that .
Mary !
They 've kidnapped her !
ZEPPO : Who 's been kidnapped ?
Mary , my daughter ! Do something !
But who could 've done it ?
It 's that Alky Briggs !
You saw them drag her into the car .
Where did they take her ?
First , they blindfolded me and then they ...
Of course , they took her to the barn .
Fellows , let 's all pack up a lunch and go down to the old barn .
Fred , you go down to the North Road . Jack , you head down by Front Street .
I 'll go pick up a couple of the boys .
And I 'll take care of picking up a couple of dames .
Women ?
This is no time for women .
GROUCHO : On to the barn !
Gee , I wish I had a horse .
ALKY : Hurry it up , boys .
MAN : Come on .
Let me go !
No use yelling , kid .
Nobody will hear you in here .
You wait till my father hears about this !
He 's gonna hear about it because I 'm gonna tell him myself .
Take it easy !
You 're not going anyplace .
Don 't get all excited . Come on .
You take your hands off of me !
Listen , kid .
Nobody 's gonna hurt you .
You 'll be out in an hour if your dad comes through .
Butch , you take care of the girl while I telephone Joe . Come on , you guys .
You take your hands off of me !
Now , make yourself at home , but shut up !
DRIVER : $ 1.10 .
GROUCHO : Here 's $ 1 .
Keep the change .
DRIVER : But I said $ 1.10 .
GROUCHO : Give me $ 1 .
I 'll keep the change .
That 's a half a dollar I owe you .
You call this a barn ?
This looks like a stable .
It looks like a barn but smells like a stable .
Well , let 's just look at it .
Get out of here !
Have you got a girl in that hayloft ?
BUTCH : No !
You 're a bigger fool than I thought .
Beat it , I tell you !
- What 'd you say ? - I said beat it !
GROUCHO : Pardon me . What did you say ?
BUTCH : I said beat it !
He said beat it .
Gee , I wish I 'd said that .
Everybody 's repeating it .
I 'm coming down there and get you !
Don 't bother .
We 'll come right up .
Come on .
I 'm going in to get him . [ Hens clucking ]
Here we are at the old barn , all set for a nice picnic lunch .
Gosh , the picnic is off , we haven 't got any red ants .
I know an Indian who 's got a couple of Red aunts .
Don 't you think we 'd better go look for the girl ?
Let 's wait till we eat , there 's hardly enough lunch for two .
I don 't see why she couldn 't get kidnapped near a restaurant .
Some dark night , I think I 'll come and lay for you if the hens don 't get sore . Here .
Go over to that filling station and get some milk . Grade-A .
Well , come on .
Where 's the milk ?
There 's a customer ahead of me . Hey !
- What are you doing here ?
- What are we doing ?
What about you , kidnapping a girl ?
Old-fashioned piece of melodrama ... kidnapping a girl !
You 've been reading too many dime novels .
Go on .
You get him .
I 'll wait for you outside .
Keep out of this loft !
It 's better to have loft and lost than never to have loft at all . - Nice work .
- Beat it , or I 'll throw you out !
[ Hens clucking frantically ]
CHICO : Take your face out of my foot ! BUTCH :
So , thought we were afraid ? Thought we were afraid , did you ?
BUTCH : Now I 'm gonna give it to you guys right !
Butch !
What happened ? Hey !
You , get out of that loft !
Butch , what happened ?
Come up here , Butch .
Where 's all those farmers ' daughters I 've been hearing about for years ?
Why don 't you boys fight over there ?
You want to break my glasses ? Come on , folks .
Step right up .
Only 10 cents a chance . Attaboy !
Here you are .
Ten cents gets you in the only game in the stable .
Let 's see .
Number 16 wins .
And the lucky number .
There you are , young man .
Sorry you didn 't get a better one . CHICO :
Let 's see what comes up .
Well , if he isn 't the lucky guy .
Double 0 .
Two shots for the price of one .
Folks , this is the best game in all ... You 're a mother , you understand .
How would you like to have somebody ... steal one of your heifers ?
I know , heifer cow is better than none ... but this is no time for puns . Get in that battle over there .
Here we are again at the ringside , and it looks like a great battle .
Now the boys are locked in the centre of the ring .
What a grudge fight . Zowie !
Zowie ! Zowie !
That makes three zowies , and a man gets a base on balls .
Ending of the first inning .
No runs , no errors , but plenty of hits . [ Exclaims in mock joy ]
This program comes to you courtesy of the Golden Goose Furniture Company ... with three stores : 125th Street , 125th Street and 125th Street .
You furnish the girl , we tar and feather your nest .
Look for our advertisement in today 's ash can .
Now the boys are at it in the centre of the ring !
Oh ! That one hurt !
Come on , you palookas !
Stop stalling ! Oh , mama , if I only had my youth again .
Round two .
Both boys are fiddling in the ring , and I don 't think much of the tune .
Briggs is bobbing and weaving .
It 's nice work if you can get it . Now they 're trying . Very trying .
I copped that one from an almanac .
Now they 're in the centre of the ring , and the crowd hurrahs . [ Cow mooing ]
Oh , Dad !
Are you all right , honey ? [ Bells clanking ]
Good boy .
Remember , old Joe Helton never forgot a friend .
This is one job that certainly was a pleasure . - What are you doing ?
- I 'm looking for a needle in a hay stack .
[ Upbeat instrumental music ]
Haven 't we been announced ?
I am Fräulein von Kesten .
Please , don 't get up , Your Excellency
I 'll take a seat too . Please
I am afraid to say that the Headmistress is indisposed at present
I 'm so sorry
She regrets very much not being able to welcome you herself
Please , tell the Headmistress that I also regret it very much
I wanted to introduce our little niece myself
Manuela , make a curtsey
How do you do ?
– Well , you 're pretty big for fourteen . – Fourteen and a half
How is her education progressing ?
Her education so far could have been better
She 's almost an orphan
My brother-in-law is certainly a good man But you know what army officers are like
They don 't understand about educating young girls
Unfortunately , my poor sister died too soon
She 's overly sensitive and a bit of a scatterbrain .
There 's no harm in a few tears . You 'll get over it
Manuela , pull yourself together
An officer 's daughter crying !
Hey !
You can 't go up there
– Why not ?
– Come down .
It 's forbidden
Hello
I am Margo von Rasso .
I 'm to look after you
So , Manuela ... Chin up now . Make your father proud of you
Work hard and do as you 're told . I want you to get good results
Don 't spoil my plans for your future
– Do you promise ?
– Of course , Aunt
Give me a kiss then
Adieu , Fräulein von Kesten .
– Goodbye , Your Excellency
Thank you for everything you will do for the child
Do well , Manuela
Come on . This way
The main stairs are only for the Headmistress and guests
First , we 'll get your uniform .
The wardrobe mistress is expecting you
It 's on the fourth floor .
I 'll show you the ropes
But you must do things for me too .
– Yes , Marga
In the morning you 'll bring me water for washing
That 's just the under class
" And everyone shouts as loud as they can :
" When do we eat ? "
" And everyone shouts as loud as they can :
" When do we eat ? "
I 'm hungry as a hunter
That 's the new girl
– I 'm Oda von Oldensleben .
– I 'm Barbara von Beckendorf
I 'm Ilse von Treischke .
Do you know what dormitory you 're in ?
Marga says I 'm in Fräulein von Bernburg 's
So am I. Be careful you don 't fall in love
Why ?
Because all the girls have a crush on Fräulein von Bernburg
God ! I can 't bear to listen to it
" Ilse , how I envy you !
You 're in her dormitory
" Oh God , oh God
" Tell me , is it true that she kisses you at night ? "
I 've had lots of weird governesses I didn 't pay attention to them .
– It 's funny with her
You never know how to take her
One minute she looks at you terribly Then , all of a sudden , she 's very kind
She 's really strange , that Bernburg
Ilse , you shouldn 't call her just Bernburg
Ah , be glad I don 't call her the Golden One
Manuela , where have you been ?
Come with me
Nice girl , isn 't she ?
Ah , there you are . Come in here .
Come here
So you 're No. 124 .
Come on , get undressed
– What are you doing with my dress ?
– Keep quiet , little one
In five weeks , if you behave , you 'll have a day out Then you 'll get your clothes back .
Now come over here
Come here , sit on this chair
Now for your hair
Oh please , don 't do that
It is the rules .
The hair must be plaited tightly
– It hurts .
– You will get used to it
– Oh , those hairpins !
– It 's the rules , too . Soon you won 't notice it
Come with me . We 'll put on your dress
It is too long .
We have to pin it up
– Someone 's worn this before .
– Of course , what do you think ?
A new dress for each girl wouldn 't be economical says Fräulein von Kesten .
No , no , we are not that generous
When a girl leaves , her dress is handed on until it 's worn out
Look , what does this mean ?
A heart and the letters " E. v. B. "
This means Elisabeth von Bernburg
The girl who wore that dress before must have been infatuated with Fräulein von Bernburg
So , you are the new girl ?
Show me how you look
All right
Now turn around
Your hair needs to be tidier
Why are you shivering ?
Are you nervous ?
No
That 's good
Manuela , I demand total discipline
You must notify me before leaving the dormitory
Talking while dressing and undressing is strictly forbidden
Is that clear ?
Good . You may go to the others
This is your cupboard .
The key 's there , open it
Books ?
They are forbidden .
You must give them to me
Why ?
– Have you any money ?
– Some
Give it to me
– Why 's that ?
– It 's not allowed .
They keep it for you
Come over here
Grand , eh ?
Mia stuck up a picture of Henny Porten
But I 've got Hans Albers
And he 's got a lot of ...
What 's it called ?
What do they call what all the movie stars have ?
Sex appeal ?
Yes , he 's got that
– Chocolate ?
Have to give it up .
– But I ... – No buts .
Rules are rules .
– Heavens , Marga , don 't be like that !
It 's nothing to do with you .
I 'm in charge of the new girl
My name 's Edelgard
Can I help you ?
Yes , please
What 's that book ?
– I was going to read it on the journey
It 's from my Uncle 's library . I haven 't read it yet
Wow !
This is great
– You must give it to me .
– No , I must not
It 's my book !
– What 's all this ?
Marga !
– Yes , Fräulein von Kesten
– Something forbidden ?
– Yes , Fräulein von Kesten
Take these things away
Meinhardis , come here
I keep my good and bad marks in here
If anything forbidden is found in your cupboard , you get a black mark
If you get more than five black marks in four weeks , you 're not allowed out
So ... watch out
Dismissed !
Here are the bills , Headmistress
Headmistress , please
You must reduce expenses .
They are too high
Yes , Headmistress .
We do our best
The children are already complaining of hunger
Hunger ?
We Prussians know how to hunger .
They are children of soldiers
And God willing , mothers of soldiers too
What they need is discipline , not a life of luxury
– How true , Headmistress , how true .
– Poverty is no sin
It enobles .
This is the true meaning of Prussianism as it once was
Let the others gorge themselves .
They 'll be sorry
What I like best is stuffed roast hare
Our cook makes a big coffee cake with a crumble topping this thick
Eclairs with whipped cream are even better
Through discipline and hunger , hunger and discipline we shall be great again . Or not at all !
My Mother wrote that they 've been slaughtering on the farm
Oh , why can 't she send me a ham ?
Nobody must have more than anyone else
But if she just sent a whole ham ?
Some girls ' parents aren 't well off any more
I 'd give them some
I wouldn 't eat it all myself
Why scrape so much butter off ?
Don 't blame me , there 's only half a pound for fifty girls
The girls are as meek as lambs They daren 't complain about anything
Everything is discipline and order here
Line up !
Hurry up
The little Meinhardis , Headmistress
Well , well
Get ready for the prayers .
March forward !
Closer !
Forward !
Closer
We 'll sing the first verse of the hymn " So take my hand "
I ask you to raise your hearts and hands , to repent your sins , acknowledge the errors of your ways , and beg forgiveness of your Father in Heaven . – Amen
I have something further to say
It has reached my ears that certain rules are being disobeyed
Letters are being sent without prior approval with unfounded complaints about the school
Staff will report any further incidents to me
The first culprit will be severely punished
Days out will be cancelled and wearing uniform forbidden
Own clothes will have to be worn when walking through town
Just imagine her naked
You have been warned
I wouldn 't send my children to a boarding school
Would you ?
– I 'd have to think about it
That 's the infantry That 's the cavalry
Girls , come here a minute
Look , what Marie can do
Come here , Marie .
Watch !
Come on , Marie . – Leave me alone .
You 're always laughing at me
No , no . Just take a deep breath
What a body !
Quiet !
What 's all this noise ?
Edelgard !
What are you doing ?
We were talking of Manuela 's mother
She died a long time ago . Manuela told me about her
Go and wash
You have no mother ?
No .
Otherwise I wouldn 't be here
Come now . Is that so terrible ?
Come here
Don 't tell yourself it 's awful here
It 's still strange to you
You don 't know the other girls yet
But you mustn 't think you 'll always be unhappy
Listen to me .
You must tell yourself that you 'll be very happy here
Pray to God every night and ask Him to help you
Will you promise me ?
See what a reasonable girl you are
Now go to bed .
I 'll come back to say goodnight
Watch !
" It has reached my ears ... " ... that certain rules are being disobeyed "
" You have been warned "
Quiet !
Everybody to bed
– Well , are you all ready ?
– Yes , Fräulein von Bernburg
Gives each one a smacker
Wonderful !
Watch , Manuela .
It 's my turn next
Step , step , step !
Hey , Josi Bleicher has a crush on me .
Listen ...
" Dearest , sweetest Mia ...
" Let me be with you and sit near you at table
" From your loving , little Josi "
What 's that note ?
Show me
Hurry up .
I 'm waiting
I 'm not interested in your silly games
Throw it in the basket and remember , once and for all :
writing notes is strictly forbidden .
– Thank you !
That was awfully nice of Fräulein von Bernburg
She is always so decent
I try to be a friend to the children
– On equal terms ?
– Why not ?
How do you maintain authority ?
You are their superior and must keep your distance
We must awaken the children 's ambition
Excellent , Fräulein von Attems
Affinity has no place here
That might lead to emotionalism
Always love !
Discipline is the main thing
The German classics must be cultivated
Fräulein von Bernburg , I have noticed that you give very few black marks
I 've no need to punish the children , they obey me and learn well
Indeed ! And Manuela von Meinhardis ?
Yes ... she doesn 't do well .
But that will change
I find her charming .
And she does her work superbly
Oh , Manuela is so ladylike .
She learns excellently with me
She prepares my lessons better than the other girls
So far , although I say it myself the results of my teaching have always been good
Yes , exceptionally good
Ladies , please !
Yes , we know that .
And we appreciate it
But please , do not try to exceed your duties
Certainly not
But the children must trust us
Sit down
So ... " Jacob was in a strange land with his father-in-law Laban ... " ... and wanted to return to Canaan with his wives Rachel and Lea and his children "
Who wants to tell the story ?
" Jacob lifted up his eyes and behold , Esau came "
He was his brother .
" Of his many wives ... " ... the most beautiful one was Rachel , and with little Joseph and Benjamin ... " ... he put her behind him . " – Why behind him ?
Because he was afraid . He 'd given Esau some red pottage and feared he might still be angry
" And the sheep he put in front
" Esau approached and warmly embraced him
" Then Jacob rejoiced "
That 's very nice .
Be seated
How is our work for today ?
Edelgard , first verse
" Oh , that I had a thousand tongues and a thousand mouths " Then would I use them all to sing from the depths of my heart " Praises for all eternity
Well done , sit down
Manuela , second verse
" Oh , that my voice would carry ... " to ...
Unprepared again
Edelgard , this is too terrible
I really learned it well , but in front of Fräulein von Bernburg I forget everyting
Fräulein von Bernburg wants to see you
I wonder why ?
I feel sorry for Fräulein Manuela
Sorry for her ?
Why , may I ask ?
She cries a lot at night .
Her pillow is always wet through
Of course not
She must be homesick
I won 't be able to say a thing .
I feel faint
Ah , never mind
Come in
Come here
Look at this
Tell me , haven 't you any new clothes ?
Where were you before you came here ?
– At my aunt 's
At your aunt 's ?
Full of holes
My aunt thought it would do
And what do you think ?
That it won 't do
I agree , it won 't do
Perhaps we can find a new petticoat somewhere
It may be a bit long , but we can take it up
For me ?
Too good for me .
– Silly child
What an emotional girl you are
Come
Have a good cry .
Sit down
I 'm not unhappy at all
I don 't know why I 'm crying
Tell me ... Are you homesick ?
Homesick ?
No .
I just feel like crying sometimes
And you don 't know why ?
Or is it something you can 't trust me with ?
I can trust you with everything , but it 's hard to say
Well , try .
I 'd really like to know
When you say goodnight and leave , and shut the door to your room I stare at the door in the darkness
I want to get up and come to you but I know that I can 't
And I think of when I get older and have to leave the school and every night you will kiss other girls
– What thoughts you have !
– I love you so much !
But you 're always so distant .
I can 't ever go to your room and talk to you or hold your hands ...
– Well , child , control yourself
Don 't be a little girl . Be a good comrade
You know I can 't make exceptions
Or the other girls will be jealous
I think of you often , Manuela
Oh , I am so glad !
– Now , you won 't cry anymore ?
– No , no more
Well , there you are What is it now ?
May I ask you something ?
Are you happy ?
You can 't imagine how wonderful it is to live for you children
Now just run downstairs to the others . And take your washing with you
Thank you so much
Girls , another boring Sunday !
My mother says I mustn 't be weak
" The Fatherland needs people of steel "
My mother spent four years here , too
Has she forgotten how awful it is ?
How deep it is !
Once again
Come here , Marga .
– What are you doing ?
How deep is this hole ?
Silly , you can test it by the law of gravity
– How do you do it ?
– You count the seconds it takes to reach the bottom , then add the acceleration of gravity – 9.81
Great !
I 'll try with a firework . – No , don 't !
You 'll only make a noise
Watch , girls !
One , two ...
Girls ! Listen to this
" Dear Parents , today is another horrid Sunday
" Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days ?
" Please , send me something to eat
" Your loving daughter , Ilse "
If the Headmistress got hold of that !
But she won 't . I 'm going to smuggle it out
Well , children ...
Isn 't it a nice Sunday ?
– Yes , very nice
Doing good work ?
Show me
Very nice .
Also good
Show me your stockings , Marie
Good
Also very good
Show me your stocking
Good .
You 'll get a good mark for it
Goodbye , children .
– Goodbye , Fräulein von Kesten
Johanna !
Come here
Please , smuggle this letter out .
Don 't get caught
Don 't worry , Fräulein Ilse
I 'll make sure no one sees
Thank you very much , Johanna !
Goodbye
" To celebrate the birthday of our distinguished Headmistress "
" Hold , o Queen !
" Long was I sunk in a delusive dream
" I loved , but now I am at last awake "
Oh Manuela , you look so handsome !
Do you think she will like me ?
She must like me .
– Of course
Just watch .
Today I certainly won 't forget my lines !
" Hold , o Queen !
" Long was I sunk in a delusive dream
" I loved , but now I am at last awake "
" All alone , Madam ? " " Madman ! "
" With none of your ladies-in-waiting ? "
" To what rude boldness my indulgence leads ! "
" Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez Is over now ...
" ... and yet your highness quits / These joyous scenes no happier than before "
Elise , where is my beard ?
Quiet , now comes our scene
" Cannot some letters be discovered ? "
" Truly , an intercepted letter from the prince ... " ... would work with rare effect "
This letter came back because it was wrongly addressed
Sender :
Ilse von Westhagen
" By Heaven !
I 'm all amazement .
Compass this
" And I 'll bow down to thee , Dominican ! "
" Soft !
Some one comes
" ' Tis she – ' tis she herself ! "
Open it !
Give it to me
" Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days ? "
Charming words !
Now listen to me
Children who lie and smuggle letters cannot be in plays .
Take your costume off !
I can 't be in the play ?
– No !
Fortunately , the letter was wrongly addressed
Your parents have been spared the anguish of an ungrateful child
Leave me alone
Stop dreaming !
" And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne "
No , child .
How often do I have to tell you ?
Don 't just speak . Declaim !
" And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne "
Oh go .
You have no talent , child .
Next , please ! Posa !
Repeat the sentence you always stumble on
I know it very well !
Good grief , child ! " One pen-stroke now , one motion of your hand ... "
" One pen-stroke now , one motion of your hand ... "
On your knees ! Arms open !
– I thought ...
– Don 't think , obey !
" Grant us liberty of thought , " Fräulein von Attems !
Of course ... Little Eboli , come
Repeat your sentences
" O Carlos , how cruelly you play with me "
No , no
Here you must bring into play the whole art of feminine seduction
Just listen to me .
She looks at him and says
" O Carlos , how cruelly you play with me "
Excuse me , Fräulein von Attems , but it 's about to start
– Good evening , children .
– Good evening , Headmistress
Be seated
I will not leave you here , Hans
Because of internal difficulties the role of Domingo will be read by Liese von Zieritz
" Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez Is over now ...
" ... and yet your highness quits / These joyous scenes no happier than before "
Come here
You 've got yourself in a fine mess !
Come , it 's not that bad
I 'm not in the play either
Wash your face and come downstairs
She 's so adorable !
" At length ' tis come – the happy moment 's come
" Carlos may touch this all-beloved hand "
" I hear a step .
What boldness !
" Arise ! "
" I will not rise . Here will I kneel forever
" Here will I lie enchanted at your feet And grow to the dear ground you tread on "
" Madman !
To what rude boldness my indulgence leads !
" Know you , it is the Queen , your mother " Whom you address in such presumptuous strain ? "
" And know that I must die !
" Let them come here , and drag me to the scaffold !
" A moment spent in paradise like this Is not too clearly purchased by a life "
" But then your Queen ? "
" God ... " God !
" I 'll go
" I will leave you "
Hurry with the lemon
Have a taste
What a fine punch you 've brewed !
– It 's a real punch .
– It 'll make them tipsy !
Know what the Head said ?
" She has pretty legs , pretty legs "
– What did Fräulein von Bernburg say ?
– It was strange
Bernburg didn 't say a single word
But she watched you
You can 't imagine how closely she watched you
Now be quiet a moment , children
I was quite satisfied with you
Manuela , you were very good .
Just remember for the next time : better declaiming and less emotion
Manuela , I want to tell you
You are very talented
If you work hard , you could be a very good actress
I 'm very glad of that , Manuela
The children really performed well
It 's very good exercise for the girls to learn to recite Schiller
Nothing is better than the German classics
We 're grateful to you , Headmistress
The children are so lucky to be here in your charge , Headmistress
We do our best with the little we have
Silence !
Your Majesties , Your Highnesses Your Excellencies and so on
I am happy that you managed without my assistance to win the applause of the staff and their guests
I wish to congratulate you
Your helmets , swords and boots were polished to perfection
And everything else went well too
But it could have been tighter , tighter , tighter !
Still , you played your parts well
Especially our Don Carlos
To your health , Manuela !
It tastes vile
You Rhine maiden ! That punch you brewed is really something
Look , I like this stuff
Here , take mine
I 'm quite tipsy
Play something else
All right .
I 'll play " Patern "
Shall I tell the girls to be quiet ?
Let them enjoy themselves today
Yes , it 's good for them to let their hair down
Fräulein von Kesten , keep an eye on them
I was somewhat surprised . Schiller sometimes writes very freely
– I 'm so happy !
– Your hurt me
What is it ?
" E. v. B. " ?
Girls !
I want to make a speech
I love you all !
Want to know something ?
She gave me a present .
– What ?
A petticoat .
I 've got it on – A petticoat ?
She opened her cupboard and gave me a petticoat
I should wear it and think of her
No , she didn 't actually say that But that 's what she must have meant .
I 'm so happy !
Now I know for sure – she loves me !
– Who ? Fräulein von Bernburg
Nothing else matters .
She is there
She loves me !
I 'm not afraid of anything
Yes , everyone should know about it !
Long live Fräulein von Bernburg , beloved by all !
Has she gone mad ?
Long may she live !
Scandalous !
It was awful to see poor Manuela so drunk
You have to drink sometimes
From sorrow or worry I understand it very well
If it was up to me , I 'd expel her immediately
Such a child doesn 't deserve to be here .
– You are quite right
I agree .
Her place is in ... – A reform school !
– Quite
Edelgard , have you seen Manuela ?
– No , I 'm not allowed in No one is .
– I don 't understand anything at all
I would advise you to be more careful
Please , no good advise .
I 'm tired of being careful
Ma ch ? re , you 're not going to jeopardise your prospects because of this child ?
– Perhaps I am
– My God , but why ?
– Because I can 't stand injustice
Look out !
Hanni , I feel peculiar
I can 't think straight
And my head really hurts
Hanni , how did I get here ?
You were well and truly drunk
It was quite a spectacle
Aren 't you ashamed of yourself ?
The disgrace !
This establishment has never seen such a scandal
You are the worst child the school has ever had
If you were younger , you 'd be spanked
Look at me !
Look at me , I said !
It 's hardly creditable
You behaved like a street urchin
You have brought shame to the school
Where is the Headmistress ?
Your punishment will be decided later
You are well aware of what you did to Fräulein von Bernburg
She 'll never forgive you
What did I do ?
There was a phone call for you
Her Highness is visiting us this afternoon
Manuela must be there .
We must be at full strength
But she may not speak to the others
Hurry with the arrangements .
Her Highness is always punctual
Yes , Headmistress
Always punctual .
Girls !
Have you heard ?
The Head says Manuela should be cursed !
– My God , poor Manuela .
– She shouldn 't have behaved like that
– Marga , you 're always mean to her .
– Shut up !
Did you hear the Head ranting and raving ?
Have you heard about Manuela ?
– It 's mean !
Quiet !
What 's the matter ?
Why are you staring at me like that ?
I have something to say before the Princess arrives
A sorry and unprecedented case of insubordination has occurred
The Headmistress wished to save you from contact with the culprit But because of the visit an exception is being made
Manuela von Meinhardis is coming out of the sickroom The Headmistress puts you on your honour not to associate with her
Whoever speaks to her will be punished .
Do you understand ?
The Headmistress asked me to tell you not to speak to Manuela
The child must be isolated .
– Really ?
A boycott ?
That 's never happened before
I 'll speak to her !
Don 't ... Manuela will get the blame
We should tell the Princess
That won 't help matters
She 's important . What she says , they do
I 'll tell her .
I don 't care !
Where is Manuela ?
Hurry up !
Stand still !
Her Highness has arrived
Good afternoon
Good afternoon , Fräulein von G ? rschner .
How are you ?
– Thank you , very well
Good afternoon , Fräulein von Attems .
Ah , Fräulein von Bernburg
How are you ?
– Very well , thank you
– Mademoiselle Oeuillet .
Comment allez-vous ?
– Merci bien , Your Highness
This is our new English teacher , Miss Evans
– Miss Evans , how are you ?
– Thank you , very well , Your Highness
I 'm going upstairs to see the presentation
Royalty is always beautiful to see
– Don 't forget to tell her .
– I intend to
You must tell her now
Yes , child ?
What a lovely sight – so many happy children
Without a doubt , Your Highness
Beckendorf ...
– Yes , my dear .
I didn 't forget
Dear Headmistress , I 'd like to see the little Beckendorf
Fräulein Beckendorf , do you like it here ?
Yes , of course , you do
Meinhardis . – Yes , what is her name ?
– Meinhardis
Oh yes , right .
Dear Headmistress , the little Meinhardis girl
I knew your mother .
She was a very devout woman
I hope you 'll try to be like her .
You look very pale
I hope she 's not ill , dear Headmistress ?
– No , not at all , Your Highness
What a charming girl
She will be the pride of the school
Dear Headmistress , I 'd like to speak to you about the nursery school
– This way please , Your Highness .
– Goodbye , my ladies
Goodbye , children
Such a big mouth , and then you said nothing
Well , if the Head hadn 't been there ... – It 's just ridiculous !
– That wasn 't the reason . You are a coward
Rubbish !
I 'm too well brought up
No , no !
If it were not for her Highness ' visit I would have expelled Manuela this very day
Excuse me , Headmistress , but I see it differently
I know Manuela and the others better than you
I 'm close to the children .
I love them
And give them my petticoats ?
Manuela was poorly supplied
If a girl hasn 't enough clothes , we write to her mother
The girl has no mother
Edelgard !
Come here
Come in here
Such disobedience !
I wouldn 't have expected you to disregard the Headmistress' orders so blatantly
But ... I 'm so worried about Manuela !
She is so strange
Listen to me , Edelgard
Your friend isn 't worth risking so much for
Associating with her only harms you I 'm sure your parents would be very upset to know what a girl you are friends with
Manuela is not bad !
What you call sin , Headmistress I call the great spirit of love which takes a thousand forms
At this age young girls need someone to lean on
I will speak to Manuela and rid her of her exalted ideas
Exalted ideas ?
Fräulein von Bernburg , don 't you see that the contact between you and Manuela must be dissolved ?
I forbid you to speak another word with Manuela
– What is it ?
– I 'm so sorry ...
You should be sober by now
Dear Fräulein von Bernburg ...
Please , no theatrics
Very well
Go to my room and wait for me
– Did you see how pale Manuela was ?
– Yes . Terrible
When she curtsied I thought she 'd faint
Manuela ! Child !
What is all this crying for ?
Pull yourself together
Don 't be so feeble .
Come , sit here
Be reasonable now , will you ?
What you have done you know
What you have done to me , you know that too
We needn 't mention it again
You 're to be punished
You 'll be locked away
Not like prison ... just isolated
Manuela , don 't be unfair
They are treating you mildly
You should have been expelled
The Headmistress thought for a long time that would be best
But for once , mercy has prevailed
Fräulein von Bernburg Will I be allowed to see you ?
No , Manuela
But you won 't abandon me ?
It 's better for you
I 'm never to see you again ?
I couldn 't live
Manuela , what sort of talk is that ?
You shouldn 't think such things , let alone speak them
You must be brought to your senses
You must be cured whatever it takes
Cured ?
Of what ?
You should not love me so much
Why not ?
You must go now
I must go
There 's no point in your staying any longer
I 'm going now
Goodbye , dear Fräulein von Bernburg
I must speak with you
You talked to her although I forbade it
Yes , I did .
I can answer for it
I think I maintained the spirit of your order
If anything happened to Manuela it would be very unpleasant for the Head
Is Manuela with you ?
Is she hiding ?
– This can 't go on .
– We must help Manuela !
This rebellious spirit comes from you
I will not permit revolutionary ideas
Not while I am here
I won 't cling to my post .
I know I can 't stay here
I can 't stand by and see children made into scared , helpless creatures
You go this way , and we 'll go here
– Have you seen her ?
– Where can she be ?
" Our Father which are in Heaven
" Hallowed be Thy Name , Thy Kingdom come
" Thy Will be done On Earth as it is in Heaven
" Give us this day our daily bread
" And forgive us our trespasses As we forgive them who trespass against us
" Lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil
" For Thine is the kingdom " The power and the glory " For ever and ever .
Amen "
– All I hear is " help her " .
– We 're talking about a human being !
You shall leave the school today
Quick , quick
Have you all gone mad ?
What 's the matter ?
What are the children doing here ?
– Manuela wanted to throw herself down
We must thank God , Headmistress The girls have prevented a tragedy which we both would have regretted all of our lives
Larry , give me one of those empty jars .
Fill them up , will you ?
Extra !
Read all about it !
Give us a swig .
- Hello , Tommy .
- Hello .
Can grease ?
Come on , Matt .
We got business .
Give us a little kiss .
That 's what you get for fooling with women .
Hey , little boy , stop .
Stop , I say !
Stop that !
Officer , get those boys .
You little scamps !
If I get ahold of you ...
Matt , look .
That ain 't fair , Tom .
- What do you care ?
It 's only a girl .
- She 's my sister , ain 't she ?
What difference does that make ?
Help me up , Matt .
Leave her alone .
She 's doing fine .
That 's the way to learn .
That 's just like you , Tom Powers .
You 're the meanest boy in town .
He is not .
He give you his skates , didn 't he ?
I believe he did it just so he could play that trick on me .
- I 'm gonna tell your brother Mike .
- Go ahead and tell him .
Here he comes now .
You 'll help me , won 't you , Mike ?
- Where 'd you get the skates , Molly ?
- Tom gave them to me .
Tom did ?
Where 'd you get them , Tom ?
He got them from a kid who owed him some money .
I 'll bet you stole them , Tom .
Give them back , Molly .
Why don 't you mind your own business ?
Nobody asked you to put your two cents in .
Here , Tom .
I don 't want them if you stole them .
- So you 're getting like sissy Mike , too .
- Take them , Tom .
You ain 't so darn good .
Your old man swipes pigeons .
Tom Powers , he does not !
You 're a big liar .
He 's in jail .
They don 't put people there for nothing .
Everybody who belongs there , ain 't there .
That 's where you 'll be someday , Tom Powers .
I ain 't there yet .
If I do go , it won 't be for swiping pigeons .
Tell him you were only kidding , Tom .
How do you want them this time :
Three for me , too .
Three skins .
- Hello there .
- How 's it going ?
How are you ?
Hit you .
There you are .
- Hit me again .
- Hit you . There 's one .
Hit you again .
There you go .
Hey , Putty Nose .
All right .
I 'll be back in a minute , boys .
Hello , boys .
What 's up ?
- We 've got something .
- Really ?
Fine .
I 'll bet you a nickel .
- Where 'd you get them ?
- Wentworth Avenue .
How much are they worth ?
Not much .
Just cheap watches .
- Cheap watches ?
$ 1 apiece .
- Yeah , and there 's six of them , too .
I don 't know what I can do with them .
They 're hot .
Come on .
Quit stalling , Putty Nose .
You know how to sell them .
You 're too smart .
- I 'll see what I can do with them .
What do you say to 50 cents for each of them ?
- 50 cents ?
- I ain 't cheating you .
That 's a good price .
I have to take all the risk , and maybe I can 't sell them at all .
Give us the 50 cents .
You know old Putty Nose always plays on the square with you , don 't you ?
- This is only two bits .
- Yeah , and this is only a nickel .
- My mistake .
- Yeah .
All right .
Your brother owes me a month 's dues to the club , don 't you ?
- That 's right , Tom .
- So we 're calling that square , see ?
- That 's all right , isn 't it ?
You 've done a good stroke of business .
And if you find anything more ... you 'll just remember old Putty Nose , won 't you ?
Okay .
Let 's scram .
What do we want with a couple of young squirts like them for ?
They ain 't gonna be so bad .
They won 't expect much of a cut .
- Hey there , Tom .
- Hello , Putty Nose .
Hello , boys .
Are you alone ?
I 'm always alone when I 'm with Matt .
You looking for a sock on the button ?
I was afraid you might have brought Mike with you .
That sucker .
He 's too busy going to school .
He 's learning how to be poor .
Ain 't he working on the streetcars anymore ?
Sure .
He 's a ding-ding in the daytime , goes to school at night .
What do you want us for , Putty ?
Something sweet .
Remember how I always said ... when I got something good , I 'd cut you in ?
Now , Dutch here knows the whole layout .
We 've been casing the joint for a whole week .
- How about the cops ?
- You ain 't afraid of cops .
There ain 't gonna be no trouble ... and if there is , I promise you that I 'll protect you .
Now , Limpy here will be lookout .
The place is dead at night , anyhow .
Well , are you on ?
- We ain 't never done nothing so big .
- " Big " is right .
I 'm giving you a break , like I promised .
Furs is worth plenty nowadays .
How about you , Tom ?
- It 's kind of new stuff for me .
- You gotta grow up sometime .
Wait a minute .
Christmas present from Santa Claus .
With best wishes for a prosperous new year .
- I 'm scared stiff .
- Come on , ain 't nothing to be scared of .
Is that so ?
Look at you , you 're shaking yourself .
Take it off me , will you ?
Stop !
You tried to get away , did you ?
They got Limpy Larry .
Stop there !
- Where 's that big loony ?
- Where 's Putty ?
We knocked off a ...
Yeah , I know all about it .
Putty Nose beat it .
You better lay low for a while .
The heat 's on .
But Putty Nose got us into this .
He promised to see us through .
Why , that dirty , no-good , yellow-bellied stool .
I 'm gonna give it to him right in the head the first time I see him .
Yeah ?
You and who else ?
My Larry .
He was a good boy .
Larry got what he asked for .
I warned him .
He was a no-good boy .
My Larry was a good boy .
He got into bad company , that 's all .
Come here , Tommy boy .
I 'm so glad you came , Tommy .
Mrs. Dalton will be pleased to see some of Larry 's nicer friends .
" U.S. Declares war " . Read all about it !
Wait a minute , Tom .
Here comes Mike .
Extra !
Read all about it .
You should come on home with me , Molly .
I don 't know just how to tell Mom .
All right , Mike .
That sister of yours ain 't getting any bargain in Mike .
How come he ain 't working ?
I guess he got fired for snatching too many nickels .
- They look like something 's happened .
- Come on , we gotta see Paddy .
You don 't need to stall with Paddy Ryan , Tom .
I 've been watching you ever since you bought your first drink from me .
I know what you been doing .
You see , Paddy , it 's like this .
We delivered some cigars today .
Must be worth about $ 2,500 .
Took them to a place on 63rd and was told to put them in the back .
- We could lift them easy tonight .
- But we don 't know what to do with them .
You sell cigars , don 't you ?
Not that kind .
Can 't afford it .
I 've got my own system , boys , but being a fence ain 't part of it .
- We thought maybe you know somebody .
- Maybe I do .
You might take them there .
- I 'll call up and say you 're coming .
- Thanks , Paddy .
Wait a minute .
If you get in a jam , give me a ring .
You 'll find out Paddy Ryan 's your friend .
Thanks , Paddy .
Why do you want to front for us ?
We ain 't never done nothing for you .
Maybe not .
But I may need a friend myself sometime .
I 'm older than you ... and I 've learned that nobody can do much without somebody else .
Remember this , boys :
You gotta have friends .
I 've been watching and hearing about you , and I 've been worried .
I was worried when you got mixed up with that two-timer Putty Nose .
Such guys are dangerous .
I 'm glad you come to me .
As far as I 'm concerned , there 's only two kinds of people :
Right and wrong .
Now , I think you 're right .
You 'll find that I am , unless you cross me .
That 's swell .
Don 't cry .
Everything will be all right .
Hello , Ma .
Tommy boy .
You won 't leave me , will you , Tommy ?
You 're all I 've got left now , Tommy boy .
What 's the matter , Ma ?
What 's up ?
Mike 's enlisted .
Enlisted ?
In the Army ?
- In the Marines .
- But you won 't go , Tommy .
Promise me you won 't go .
You 're just a baby .
Now , listen , Ma ...
If your pa was alive , I wouldn 't care so much .
Promise me , Tommy .
I won 't go , Ma .
When 's he going ?
As soon as he gets his call .
He 's up packing now .
Go up and see him , Tommy .
We ought to be very proud of him .
- Hello , Mike .
- Hello , Tom .
I 'm glad you came .
I suppose you 've heard .
Yeah .
Kind of rushing it , ain 't you ?
Well , Tom , when your country needs you , she needs you .
I suppose you think I ought to go , too .
No .
Maybe it was selfish of me , Tom ... but somebody 's got to stay here and take care of Ma .
You earn more money than I do , and they 'd have called me first anyway .
- You always did get all the breaks .
- Don 't take it like that , Tom .
You 've got to be the man of the family now .
And while we 're on the subject , I wish you 'd try to stay home a little more .
- I gotta work , ain 't I ?
- Sure .
Listen , I was in a place today , and I heard somebody say something .
- What of it ?
- Well , they were saying ...
It seemed as though they were pointing a finger at you and Matt .
Who was ?
What rat would say anything about me ...
Now take it easy .
You 're always hearing things .
You 'll get too much in your nose someday and wonder how you got it .
For crying out loud , I heard some guys talking about you ... saying you were in on some crooked work .
What am I supposed to do ?
Run ?
You ain 't asking me , you 're telling me .
And I don 't know a thing , see ?
All I 've got to say is that you 've got a good job now .
You don 't need these rats you 're running with .
You want me to go to night school and read poems .
I 've been hearing a few things myself .
- There 's nothing to hear about me .
- That 's all you know .
You ain 't so smart .
Books don 't hide everything .
- You 're a liar .
You 're covering up .
- Covering up for what ?
For you ?
- You 're nothing but a sneak thief .
- What did you say ?
You heard me , a petty larceny sneak thief .
Robbing the streetcar company .
Don 't you think that booze ain 't gonna be valuable .
I heard today that alcohol 's gone to $ 30 a gallon .
The real McCoy 's hard to get .
All you gotta do when you deliver a good shipment ... is size up the layout and let me know .
I can use some of it .
I know two or three others that 'll buy all that I can 't handle .
It means real dough , a three-way split .
I said we 'd get together sometime , didn 't I ?
Well , the time has come now .
Grab the rope .
One jerk to start , and two to stop .
Thanks , Hymie .
There .
- Are you satisfied ?
- I 'll say .
Pretty soft , wasn 't it ?
How do you like playing with Paddy ?
- I wonder what to do with so much dough .
- You ain 't started .
I 'll make big shots out of you yet .
- Anything you say goes for me , Paddy .
- Me , too .
And here 's to us .
31.5 inches .
Don 't forget , plenty of room in there .
Sir . Here 's where you need the room .
Such a muscle .
Make it snappy or you 'll find out what it 's for .
- Yeah , come on .
Let 's get out of here .
- Yes , sir .
22.5 inches .
Did you read about that big robbery at the booze warehouse ?
42.5 inches .
- Right under their very noses .
- Yeah , a guy was just telling me about it .
33.5 inches .
If those men get away with that , they 'll be rich for life .
37.5 inches .
Did you read what it said in the papers ?
150,000 .
150,000 inches .
Dollars .
Why don 't you two mugs get an adding machine ?
All through now , gentlemen .
Thank you .
Don 't forget what I told you . Plenty of room there .
Yeah , and remember : Six buttons .
Be careful , Matt , or you 're going to cut the nose right off of you .
- Lf it ain 't Mr. Tom and Mr. Matt .
- Hello , George .
How 's business ?
- Big night .
- Good .
Hey , stoop , that 's got gears ! It ain 't no Ford !
Okay , boss .
Mr. Powers , Mr. Doyle .
Alone as usual ?
I am , but Matt 's all fixed up .
He 's got me with him .
The night 's young yet .
- You 'll wind up with something .
- Yeah , with the morning paper .
- Couple of lightweights .
- Yeah , flat tires .
Why don 't you send them home to their mothers ?
- They 're no good to the joint anymore .
- And the ladies , too ?
Don 't be silly .
How about something with ice in it ?
Well , we 're with friends .
Yeah , I know it .
I 'm one of them .
Hello , baby .
- What are you going to have ?
- Anything you say , big boy .
You 're a swell dish .
I think I 'm going to go for you .
- Look at what I got measured for .
- I don 't even know you 're here .
Come on .
Then it 's a deal ?
If you can assure me my name will be protected .
You 'll be protected all over the place .
Hello , boys .
You can take off those clothes .
You got new jobs .
First , meet Mr. Leehman .
These are the two lads I was telling you about .
Sit down , boys .
How do you like the brewery business ?
- We don 't know nothing about it .
You 're in it now .
Mr. Leehman and I got it all fixed .
Mr. Leehman owns that big brewery over on Union Avenue .
- But that 's been closed since ...
- Yeah . It 's going to open up .
You spoke of a rather remarkable man from the West Side .
Nails Nathan .
- Paddy , is Nails throwing in with us ?
- He 'll be here any minute .
I don 't believe I 'm acquainted with the gentleman .
Then you 're the only man in town that ain 't .
At least everybody 's heard of him , boys .
Believe me , Mr. Leehman , when Nails and his mob start on a job ... it 's already done .
That Schemer Burns ' crowd tries to muscle in on us ...
I pity them .
You understand that my desire is merely to furnish a better grade of beer ... than the working man can now obtain ...
- under the present , unfortunate ...
- In your hat .
And again in your hat , mister .
I 've heard that north wind blow before .
If you 're in this , you 're in for the coins , same as the rest of us .
- Gentlemen , meet Nails Nathan .
- Born Samuel .
Tom Powers , glad to know you .
And you 're Matt Doyle .
- How are you ?
Sit down , fellas .
- How 'd you know ?
Know all about you .
Paddy has been talking .
Meet Mr. Leehman , Nails .
Tickled pink .
Don 't take offense at anything I say , Mr. Leehman .
If we 're in this racket together , we got to keep the cheaters off , right ?
My name is not to appear ...
Don 't worry .
We won 't use it in our advertising .
Paddy , the mob 's all ready by the time you can open .
Got some swell routes laid out for you , and the stock 's all marked .
You mean , you have the customers all signed up ?
- Signed up ?
- Yes , sir .
Signed up or sealed up .
Tom and Matt here is the official signers and sealers .
- The trouble squad .
- And if they need any help ...
Nails has got some pretty handy boys with their gloves all oiled .
Dear me , I 'm afraid this means ...
It means they buy our beer or they don 't buy any beer .
All right , Dutch , get going .
And don 't take any back talk from those speakies .
Tell them , " Here 's the beer you ordered " . If they doubt you , call Matt and Tom .
All right , Matt , Tom , get going .
- Hello , Steve . How 's business ?
- Business ?
Business is on the bum .
That 's with telling us you only took two kegs of beer last trip ...
- but now you don 't want any at all .
- Business is on the bum .
Give us a couple of beers .
That 'll help a little .
- That ain 't our beer .
- Where 'd you get this slop ?
It 's good , ain 't it ?
And it 's cheaper than yours .
How much you paying for this stuff ?
- Two bits a glass .
- All right .
Screw .
I thought so .
You can sell ours for the same price .
Get your hands off that !
Somebody 's got to protect your customers .
What can I do ?
I can 't help it if I have to buy from Schemer Burns .
- They tell me the same thing that you do .
- You 're yellow .
Please , you ain 't gonna slug me , are you ?
Maybe not today .
But I 'm telling you this for the last time .
When Dutch comes , he will leave some beer .
You 're going to take it and kick in with the dough .
If you don 't , somebody will come and kick your teeth out one at a time .
Get me ?
You 'll be needing some right away .
How many should we leave ?
- Two kegs .
- You hear that , Dutch ?
Bring in five kegs .
" Mr. And Mrs. Patrick J. Ryan " .
" Mr. And Mrs. Bernard Grogan " .
" Welcome home , Michael Powers " .
" Samuel Nathan " ?
I never heard of him .
Nails Nathan .
One of Tom 's new friends .
What 's Tom doing now , Pat ?
Mother said something about a political job .
Yeah ?
And that ain 't all .
He and Matt have been running around ... with a couple of girls at the Washington Arms Hotel .
Now , the worst part of it all is that he 's been lying to his mother .
He 's leaving her think that he 's made an honest success .
Why , sure it 's only a question of time when he 's going to be caught .
And then he 'll be after breaking her poor heart .
But what 's he doing ?
Beer .
Bootleg .
He 's one of Paddy Ryan 's gang .
But that 's not all .
Sure , they stop at nothing .
You either take their beer , or they put you on the spot .
I tell you , Michael , it is a wicked business .
Why , only last week ...
- Got it ?
- Yeah , I got it .
That 's nice of you , Tommy ... but I don 't think Mike will be able to drink any .
It 's the best beer in town .
It 'll do him good .
Dinner 's all ready , Michael .
- Shall I help you in ?
- No , Mother .
I can make it .
I 'll be getting along .
I 'll see you all later .
Bye-bye .
How 's the meat , Mikey ?
Fine , Ma .
I wish you 'd eat more .
Try some of this cabbage .
I 've had plenty , Ma .
Say , we haven 't drunk to your health yet .
This is a swell celebration .
There you are , Mike .
- That 's enough for you , Ma .
- Put a head on that , will you ?
Miss Powers .
Well , here 's to you , Mike .
Why don 't you drink , Mike ?
Come on , it 's only beer .
I don 't want any , Matt .
What 's eating you ?
I 'm not interfering with your drinking .
If you want to drink it , go on .
If I don 't want to , I don 't have to .
So beer ain 't good enough for you ?
You think I 'd care if it was just beer in that keg ?
I know what 's in it .
I know what you 've been doing ... how you got those clothes and those new cars .
You 've been telling Ma you 're in politics , that you 're on the city payroll .
Pat Burke told me everything .
You murderers !
There 's not only beer in that keg , there 's beer and blood .
The blood of men !
You ain 't changed a bit .
Besides , your hands ain 't so clean .
You killed and liked it .
You didn 't get them medals for holding hands with Germans .
Please , he ain 't himself .
He don 't know what he 's talking about .
This trip 's been too much for the poor soul .
Lord have pity on him .
Please , Tommy .
Come on , Matt .
Let 's get out of here before I go screwy , too .
Don 't go away , Tommy .
Don 't be angry .
You can send my clothes to the Washington Arms Hotel .
Get up , lazybones .
What are you gonna do , sleep all day ?
Button up .
I can sleep as long as I like .
That 's a fine way to talk to me after I cooked this lovely breakfast for you .
With my own lily-white hands .
Lake View 8515 .
Right .
- Hello ?
- Hello , is Tom there ?
I just called his apartment .
They said he stepped across the hall for breakfast .
Nails Nathan .
Just a minute .
Tom , it 's for you .
- Who is it ?
- Nails Nathan .
- Hello , kid .
- Hello , Tom .
- What 's the matter , kid ?
- Nothing .
Only the dame 's beginning to get on my nerves , that 's all .
Listen , I 'm getting fed up on these rubber checks bouncing in .
We 're laying down good beer and getting nothing but a lot of bum paper .
I got one this morning for $ 1,200 from that Pete over on Kedzie Avenue .
Get over there .
I want that dough .
Cash or his heart .
If you can 't bring in one , bring in the other .
I 'll bring you both .
Leave it to me , kid .
All right .
Come on in , Matt .
Shake a leg .
Nails wants us to do him a favor .
In a minute .
It 's all ready , Tom .
- Ain 't you got a drink in the house ?
- Not before breakfast , dear .
I didn 't ask you for any lip .
- I asked you if you got a drink .
- I know , Tom ...
- but I wish ...
- There you go with that " wishing " stuff .
I wish you was a wishing well ... so that I could tie a bucket to you and sink you .
Maybe you found someone you like better .
How goes it , babe ?
- Going south ?
- Yes .
But I 'm not accustomed to riding with strangers .
We 're not going to be strangers .
- How far are you going ?
- Pretty far .
Near Jackson Park .
- Is that out of your way ?
- No .
My chauffeur 's just crazy about long drives .
Step on it , James .
Well , do I look good to you ?
- You sure do .
- I feel flattered .
You know , you 're not the worst I 've seen , either .
- From Chicago ?
- Not exactly .
I came from Texas .
- Where you living ?
- The Congress Hotel .
If you 're a stranger here , Tom and me will show you the town .
Stick to your driving , mug .
Say , you can let me off here .
I 'm going to meet my friends on the corner .
Could I see you again later ?
I 'd be happy to have you call me sometime .
I mean , later today .
I 'll think it over .
Give me your phone number and I 'll call you .
All right , babe .
Yards 3771 .
I 'll remember it .
And in the meantime , thanks .
- My name is Gwen .
Gwen Allen .
- And mine 's Tom Powers .
- Yeah , and mine is Matt .
- He ain 't got a name , just a number .
She 's a honey .
I could go for her myself .
What do you mean , you could go for her yourself ?
You could go for an 80-year-old chick with rheumatism .
When are you going to see her ?
- She 's going to call me .
- Find out if she 's got a friend .
What do you want with her friend ?
You got Mamie , ain 't you ?
Ain 't you going to kiss your little baby ?
- You got Kitty , ain 't you ?
- I ain 't going to have her much longer .
I 'm fed up .
You can tell her so for me .
Step on the gas , will you ?
Max , George , quick .
Delighted to see you , Mr. Nathan .
- How are you , Joe ?
- Fine , thank you .
Where would you like to sit ?
Where do I always sit ?
Right at the ringside .
- May be full up there .
- We can fix that , sir .
Max , George , fix a table immediately at the railing for Mr. Nathan .
Great .
The best is none too good tonight .
This is a wedding celebration .
- Really ?
- Yep .
Matt 's decided to take something lawful : A wife .
- That 's something to celebrate about .
- I should say so .
- Meet Mr. And Mrs. Doyle .
- We 're honored , I assure you .
- Let 's dance while they 're fixing the tables .
- This way , please .
- Hiya , Nails .
- Hello , Tom .
- How are you , Mr. Nathan ?
- Harry , making money ?
- Right this way , please .
- Hello , Jim .
How are you ?
- Are you as happy as I am , Matt ?
- Sure , honey .
You fellows don 't know what it means to a girl , getting married .
You knew all the time I was going to marry you , didn 't you ?
Of course I did .
I was just thinking of Tom and Kitty .
Well , they 're different .
I guess Tom ain 't the marrying kind .
No , I guess not .
Are you sure that was old Putty Nose ?
- I ought to know him when I see him .
- Sure you know him .
I suppose you 'd like to put in with him again .
That 's the Fagin that put something over on you , ain 't it ?
I had to laugh when I heard about that .
That guy 's going to get you again .
He thinks you 're soft .
- He ain 't going to get me .
- We don 't want any part of him .
I haven 't got a thing to say , boys .
But they got the Indian sign on you , Tom .
- He thinks you 're a cinch .
- In a pig 's eye .
That McGonagall ain 't got a chance .
Take care of the women , Nails .
You 're not going out in the cold , dark night , are you ?
Nails will see that you get home .
We got a little job to do .
Come on , Matt .
You 're not gonna leave me tonight , Matt ?
There 's something we forgot to do , honey .
I 'll be home later .
Come on .
Where 's he going ?
They 're just walking around the block to cool themselves off .
What are you worrying about ?
Sit down .
Have it ready at 8 : 00 .
Fill it with gas .
I 'm going on a long trip .
Well , if it ain 't Tom Powers and Matt , too .
How are you , boys ?
- Been out of town ?
- Yeah , I was down home , visiting .
- Got a little drink for us , Putty ?
- Sure , Tom .
But I can 't let you in just now .
You see , I 've got a Jane inside .
I 'll bring it right out to you .
Wait a minute , Putty Nose .
- We got words for you .
- What 's up , Tom ?
We got a little business to settle , Jane or no Jane .
You ain 't sore , are you , Tom ?
I 've always been your friend .
Sure .
You taught us how to cheat , steal , and kill .
Then you lammed out on us .
If it hadn 't been for you , we might have been on the level .
Sure .
We might have been ding-dings on a streetcar .
Come on .
A Jane , huh ?
There ain 't no one here but him .
I thought so .
Why , you dirty , double-crossing ...
What are you squawking about ?
You got plenty more coming .
What are you gonna do ?
I don 't want to die .
So you don 't want to die ?
Tommy , don 't you remember you and Matt ... how you used to be just kids and how we were friends ?
You won 't let him , Matt .
I 'll do anything for you from now on .
Ain 't you got a heart , Matty boy ?
Don 't you remember how I used to play to you ?
And didn 't I always stick up for you ?
I ain 't got this coming .
Please , Matt , don 't let him .
I ain 't a bad fellow , really .
Tommy , don 't .
Ain 't you got a heart ?
Tell me you won 't let him , Matt , will you ?
You remember that song I used to sing ?
That song I taught you ?
You remember , Tommy .
Back in the club , how you kids used to laugh at that song .
Guess I 'll call up Gwen .
She ought to be home by now .
Let me make you a cup of tea .
I got to be getting back on the job in a minute .
My , but it 's good to see you again .
I was beginning to think I 'd lost you .
You can 't lose me that easy .
Poor Michael .
I 'm afraid he 's working himself into an early grave .
Days on the cars , school at night , and studying in between .
Listen , Ma , I came over to give you something .
Here , take this .
When you need more , just say so .
I 'm making plenty .
You 're a good boy , Tommy , but I can 't .
- Take it .
- Mike wouldn 't like it .
- Mike ain 't got nothing to say about it .
- No ?
Listen to me .
I 've got something important to say .
Keep it to yourself .
Nobody wants your two cents .
I don 't want you two boys fighting .
It ain 't right for two brothers .
There won 't be fighting .
Only , I don 't need his preaching .
- What is this , Ma ?
- Tommy gave it to me to buy some things .
- Ain 't that nice of him ?
- It 's more than you can do .
We don 't want your money .
I 'll look after Ma .
- On two bits a week ?
- Ma don 't drink champagne .
How do you know ?
I used to dance when I was a girl .
I won 't argue with you , and I can 't tell you all I 'd like to in front of Ma .
But get an earful of this :
You ain 't welcome in this house .
That 's blood money .
We want no part of it .
- Hiding behind Ma 's skirts , like always .
- Better than hiding behind a machine gun .
You 're too smart .
- I 'm going , Ma .
- And don 't forget your change .
- Money don 't mean nothing to me .
- No , I guess not .
But with no heart or brains , it 's all you 've got .
You 'll need it .
Why you sneaking , stooling ...
Michael , why did you hit him ?
I may leave town next week .
You don 't care , do you ?
When I first met you , I sort of figured you was on the make .
Not much . You know what I mean .
And besides that ... I figured you was sort of different , too .
That is , different from the kind of girls I was used to .
I don 't go in for these long-winded things , but with me , it was always yes or no .
And I could never figure you out .
- Now can you ?
- No .
But I guess I ain 't your kind .
- I think I better call it quits .
- Don 't be like that , Tommy ... because I " go for you , " as you say .
Maybe too much .
You know , all my friends ... think that things are different between us than they are .
They figure they know me pretty well ... and don 't think I 'd go for a merry-go-round .
Do you think I 'm giving you a merry-go-round ?
- Then do you want things to be different ... to please your boyfriends ? - No , I ...
No , but how long can a guy hold out ?
I 'm gonna go screwy .
- Where are you going ?
- I 'm gonna blow .
You 're a spoiled boy , Tommy .
You want things , and you 're not content until you get them .
Or maybe I 'm spoiled , too .
Maybe I feel that way , too .
But you 're not running away from me .
Come here .
Now you stay put , if you know what that means .
My bashful boy .
You are different , Tommy .
Very different .
And I 've discovered it isn 't only a difference in manner ... and outward appearances .
It 's a difference in basic character .
The men I know ... and I 've known dozens of them ... they 're so nice ... so polished , so considerate .
Most women like that type .
I guess they 're afraid of the other kind .
I thought I was , too .
But you 're so strong .
You don 't give , you take .
Tommy , I could love you to death .
Oh , nuts .
Is Tom here ?
Nails is dead .
- Who killed him ?
- Nobody .
His horse .
He was thrown off in the park , kicked in the head .
- You got that horse that killed Nails ?
- You mean Rajah ?
He bad animal .
Terrible .
Yeah , what 's he worth ?
Spirited horse .
I told Mr. Nathan not to ride him .
What 's he worth ?
He could be bought for $ 1,000 .
You see , it 's ...
- Never mind . Here .
- Where 's he at ?
Stall Number 3 .
Stay where you are .
Right now , we ain 't got a chance .
Since Nails has gone , his mob has scattered .
They 're ten-to-one against us .
Look at this dump .
Four pineapples tossed at us in two days , and the brewery set fire .
I 'm telling you , they got us on the run .
- Not me . I ain 't running .
I ain 't yellow .
- Who said you was ?
I ain 't talking about that .
I 'm gonna need you .
And you won 't be no good to me when you 're in the cemetery .
I got to have a couple of days to get the boys lined up again .
While I 'm doing that ... you 'll be where nobody knows where to find you except me .
Come on , give me your guns and your money .
All of it .
- What are you trying to pull , Paddy ?
- I 'm gonna keep you off the streets .
Even you wouldn 't be sap enough to go for a stroll without your gat .
Come on , shower down .
All of it .
You got a phone here , Jane ?
I 'm gonna call Gwen .
No , you keep away from that phone .
I 'll call from outside and tell her I sent you out of town for a few days .
- And ring up Mamie , will you ?
- Leave it to me .
This won 't be for long , boys .
I 'll have the mob lined up again in a couple of days .
You 'll see that they 're comfortable ?
- You leave that to me , Paddy .
- Okay .
Gather round , boys .
We 're going to be a happy , little family .
I hope you got plenty of this medicine .
Yards 6321 .
Hello .
Is Schemer there ?
Let me make you another drink , Tommy .
You mean to say you got any of that stuff left ?
You haven 't drank so much .
I can drink it as long as you can pour it .
Only a coal truck .
Had me going for a minute .
- Come on , get in the game , will you , Tom ?
- No .
I 'm gonna hit the hay .
I thought you 'd like a little nightcap .
You don 't need to feel ashamed in front of me .
Here , let me help you .
- I don 't need any help .
- Be a good boy and sit down .
I 'll take your shoes off , too .
I want to do things for you , Tommy .
You don 't think I 'm old , do you ?
- No .
- You like me , don 't you ?
Sure .
What 's the idea ?
Just a goodnight kiss for a fine boy .
In your hat .
Get away from me .
You 're Paddy Ryan 's girl .
- Breakfast is all ready , Tommy .
- I ain 't hungry .
Give me some coffee , will you ?
And make it black .
You aren 't sorry , are you ?
- Sorry for what ?
- For last night .
What do you mean , for getting drunk ?
Aren 't you the little playactor ?
Wait a minute .
Do you mean that ...
Why , you ...
- Tom , where you going ?
- Home .
- But Paddy ...
- I don 't care what Paddy said !
I 'm getting out of this dump .
Hey , Tom , wait a minute .
- What happened ?
- Nothing .
I just got burned up , that 's all .
What do you wanna run out on me for ?
We 're together , ain 't we ?
Sure .
Yes , sir ?
I was looking at some of the pistols in the window .
- Shall I show you some ?
- Yeah .
- I kind of like that big one .
- That one ?
All right .
- What do you call that ?
- That 's a . 38 caliber . It 's a fine ...
You got any more like it ?
- I 've got some smaller ones .
- No , same size .
Sure .
- How do you load that ?
- First you break it .
Then you stick the cartridges in the holes .
- Could I see ?
- Sure .
- That 's right . - Like that ?
- It 'll hold six .
- This will be enough .
Stick them up .
Okay , Schemer , it 's all set .
I ain 't so tough .
- Well , Doc , what do you think ?
- Can 't say .
We 'll hope for the best .
Doctor , this is Tom 's mother , brother , and Miss Doyle .
You can go in for a few moments , Mrs. Powers .
Thank you , sir .
Tommy boy .
Do you know me ?
Sure , Ma .
Mike 's here .
He 's come to see you .
- Hello , Mike .
- How are you , Tom , old scuff ?
I 've been wanting to see you .
You 're gonna be seeing a lot of me , Tom .
There 's something I wanted to say to you , Mike .
- I 'm sorry .
- Sorry for what ?
I 'm just sorry .
You know .
You and Mike are going to be friends again ?
Sure .
Friends .
Boys , I 'm so happy .
So happy .
Ma , you must like Mike a lot better than me .
No , Tommy boy .
You 're my baby .
Sure .
I 'm your baby .
You 're coming home , ain 't you , Tommy ?
To stay ?
Sure .
Coming home .
I mean , if I can ever get out of here .
You 're gonna get out of here , all right .
Why , of course you are .
You 're going to get well and strong .
Both my boys back .
All of us together again .
I 'm almost glad this happened .
And he really looked better today , did he , Michael ?
Sure , Ma , a lot better . He was sitting up .
I told him you 'd be in to see him tomorrow .
- And he 'll be coming home soon , won 't he ?
- Sure , Ma .
Paddy , come in .
What 's wrong ?
Is Tom ...
They kidnapped him from the hospital this afternoon .
What ?
Who did ?
Must have been the Burns mob .
First they give it to him in the back , then they take him when he 's helpless .
Who knows what they 're doing to him now .
- They ain 't gonna get away with this .
- I 'm doing all I can .
My boys are out in the street now .
I 'll bring Tom back , if it 's the last thing I do .
- I 'm gonna ...
- You 're gonna ... stay here at that phone and take messages .
I told my boys to call you up if they find anything .
- I 'd like to smash ...
- Listen ...
I sent word to Burns that if he 'd bring Tom back here tonight ... I 'd quit the racket .
He could have it all .
I 'd leave town and I won 't come back .
- You think they 'll do it ?
- It 's a sweet offer .
You stay here .
If you hear anything from any one of my boys ... call me at my place .
I got to get back on the job .
Don 't you like your dinner ?
Why , I just ain 't hungry , Ma .
I 'll get it , Ma .
This is Mike .
When ?
You are ?
Fine .
Ma , they 're bringing Tom home .
- They are ?
When ?
- Right now .
He 's on his way .
- Is he all right ?
- He must be .
- They wouldn 't be bringing him home .
- It 's wonderful .
I 'll get his room ready .
I knew my baby would come home .
- Who called ?
- One of Paddy 's boys .
Didn 't say who .
- Molly dear ?
- Yes , Mother ?
Bring up some clean sheets out of the linen closet .
- Hurry , dear .
SWIMMING with
JEAN TARIS CHAMPION OF FRANCE
THE SPORTING CLUB DE FRANCE KINDLY LENT ITS POOL TO THE FILMMAKERS
Now starting , Jean Taris ... holder of 23 French records , in all distances , from 100 to 1,500 meters , winner of the English championships for 500 and 880 yards , and world record holder for the 800 meters .
Like a fish , water is the swimmer 's element .
There are a few movements to learn , but first , just get in the water .
You can 't learn to swim in your room .
One , two , three , four ! I use a stroke called the " crawl " for both long-distance and speed swimming .
A correct starting position is important :
Grip the edge firmly with the feet to avoid slipping , and push off strongly with the legs , arms extended .
Enter the water in an almost prone position .
Glide under the water and begin kicking as soon as possible .
Then the arms begin to work .
The head should be held fairly high but relaxed .
Rotate the upper body .
Alternate strokes with the arms .
Kick with the legs well-extended .
Then the legs work more freely and independently of the arms .
Breathing : Underwater , exhale deeply through the nose and mouth .
Inhale rapidly through the mouth , on one side only at first .
Finally , breathe on alternate sides every three strokes .
As one arm rises , the other carries you along .
Same principle for the backstroke .
The leg movement is the same , but the scull-like arm movement is a bit different .
The arms stroke like oars alongside the body .
Besides the crawl , other new competitive strokes are :
To turn around ... touch the edge with one hand and further down with the other , then turn around and push off with the legs .

SEVERAL YEARS LATER ... HE 'S WORKING FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY
Daddy , buy me a bicycle !
All my friends have bicycles .
I want one too .
Go ask your mother .
She said yes , since you get your bonus today .
Buy me something too .
You already got those paper balloons .
Greedy baby !
Treat her like that and no bicycle .
Business is slow .
We 'll be lucky to get a month 's pay .
Even a month 's pay would be 120 yen .
BONUSES IN PRESIDENT 'S OFFICE AT NOON
Is it a good bonus this year ?
Hoover 's policies haven 't helped us yet .
Don 't go in now .
It 's occupied .
" Bicycle ... parasol ... "
" Necktie ... "
This is good-bye .
This is my last day here .
Why ? You 're a senior employee with a pension starting next year .
I moonlighted as an agent and sold policies to a few customers who met unfortunate fates .
One died the day after buying a 20,000-yen policy .
He was hit by a car .
You didn 't run him over . It wasn 't your fault .
Another died of typhus just months after buying a 10,000-yen policy .
Still , that 's no reason to fire you .
It 's wrongful termination .
The boss has always been so good to me . I don 't want to make trouble .
You should at least have a talk with him .
They seem pleased . The bonus was 20 % more than expected .
Of course ! We should protest !
What are we waiting for ?
This isn 't just about him .
It 's about us too !
It 's time to stand up for all of us working stiffs !
You 're full of fight .
You go tell the boss .
Then again , he lost the company money . You can 't blame the boss .
Are you sneering at me ?
In that case , go talk to the boss yourself !
You bet I will !
Hypocrite !
I think it 's the company 's duty to pay even if a customer dies the day after buying a policy .
Why did you fire Mr. Yamada ?
He 's getting too old .
It 's really because his customers died right after taking out policies .
Are you telling me how to run this company ?
You 're just an employee yourself ! Mind your own business !
I don 't need troublemakers like you ! You 're fired !
It turns out this is my last day too .
I 'm on my way to buy my son a bicycle .
May I offer you some tea nearby ?
My daddy 's buying me a better one today , so there !
My bicycle ?
That 's more fun than a bicycle .
No !
It 's no fun at all !
Suit yourself !
I 'll never buy you anything again !
Mom ?
She 's out shopping for dinner .
Liar !
I 'm not scared of you !
Fine !
You want me to lock you up in the storeroom ?
He was a bad boy , so I spanked him .
He didn 't buy the bicycle he promised me .
Daddy was wrong . Now be a good boy and stop crying .
What did I do wrong ?
You shouldn 't lie to children .
He 's been dreaming of a bicycle for so long .
Daddy 's a liar !
" You are hereby discharged ... "
I argued with the boss .
I was right , but of course he fired me .
Be a good boy and play with this , okay ?
Poor kid .
Let 's buy him a bicycle .
TOKYO ... CITY OF THE UNEMPLO YED
INSURANCE WEEK CITY OF TOKYO
I never thought I 'd have to do something like this .
You 're lucky you at least have a job .
I 'm still unemployed .
My college degree makes me overqualified .
I 'm truly sorry . It 's all because of me .
Children are lucky .
They can just bawl their heads off .
A bear broke out of its cage .
A bear getting out isn 't going to change our lives .
Miyoko is sick .
She ate a spoiled arrowroot cake .
The doctor said she might get dysentery .
Why did you give her that cake ?
I sold some old paper and wanted to buy the children a treat .
The doctor wants to hospitalize her .
Worried about the money ?
I 'll earn the money somehow .
Go call a rickshaw .
Get ready to take her to the hospital .
She 's doing better .
Now that she 's out of the woods , let 's you and I go home .
Can we pay the bill ?
ONCE ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY , CHILDREN GET WELL QUICKLY
The bureau is practically empty .
Miyoko is back with us thanks to your kimonos .
Even gentlemen like him come here looking for work these days .
EMPLO YMENT OFFICE
Fancy meeting you here !
Posting a job offer at the employment office ?
I heard you stopped teaching a few years ago .
I worked for a radio program for a while .
Now I have a restaurant .
If you 're out of work , how about helping me for a while ?
At your restaurant ?
I 'll help you find a good job later .
I have contacts at the Ministry of Education .
If you feel sorry for me , I must decline .
But if it 's out of friendship for a former student , I accept .
Sorry , but a man gets sensitive when he 's poor .
THE CALORIE CAFE
CURRY RICE PORK CUTLET
A SOUND MIND RESTS IN A SOUND BOD Y
OUR PORTIONS REALLY FILL YOU UP
We met outside the employment office .
I asked him to help us out .
Let 's have him taste our curry rice .
No waitresses ?
No waitresses .
My wife and I do all the work .
Pretty waitresses can attract customers .
Like they attracted you as a student ?
THE CALORIE CAFE OUR PORTIONS REALLY FILL YOU UP
I need a hand passing these out .
I 'll make us each a banner tonight .
We can carry them around tomorrow .
How about I recruit my old classmates to spread the word instead ?
Good idea .
But we 'll pass these out too .
Daddy !
It can 't be !
Your father would never do a thing like that !
CURRY RICE CUTLET 15 SEN
OUR PORTIONS REALLY FILL YOU UP
It 's too hard passing these out .
Could you carry both banners ?
One is hard enough .
With two I couldn 't even walk .
You 'd be in better shape if you 'd trained harder back in school .
HIS WIFE WAS UTTERLY HUMILIATED TO SEE HIM LIKE THIS
They 're my pills , not yours !
Did you go out today ?
I went to see if an old classmate 's father might have a job for you .
Did he ?
I saw an awful sight on the way .
It was you .
I never asked you to stoop to something like that .
We may be hard up , but we must hold our heads high .
That old man was a former teacher of mine .
He said he 'd find me a job , so I 'm helping him in the meantime .
Are you sure he will ?
A drowning man will clutch at straws .
I feel like I 'm getting old .
I 've lost my spirit .
I 'll go with you to help tomorrow .
FOUR OR FIVE DAYS LATER ...
We 're ready .
Please come join us .

It 's been many years since we parted .
I 'm glad to see you all in good health .

FROM : THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FOR : MR. UMAKICHI OMURA
I 've found a job for you .
Teaching English at a girls ' school . Do you speak English ?
You must be relieved , Mrs. Okajima .
It 's way off in Tochigi Prefecture , but I think we should go .
I 'm sure we can return to Tokyo someday .
Late as always , I see .
Let 's sing !
Time flies , and so did our three years at school
Friends , we shall miss your youthful faces
THE END
Liberty is the happy man 's due
He enjoys love and skies of blue
But then there are some
Who no worse crimes have done
It 's the sad story we tell
From a prison cell
What 's your problem ?
Shut up !
Another day in hard labor spent
Like all the other yesterdays went
With just one horizon in sight
Iron bars morning till night
Ah , pity those who dwell
In a prison cell
In life liberty is all that counts
But man invented the prison cell
Codes and laws , do 's and don 'ts
Work , offices and houses as well
Don 't you agree ...
What life can be ?
My old friend , life is great
When you 're free to be yourself
So come on , let 's emancipate
Fresh air is good for the health
Everywhere , if you take a chance ,
Everywhere , life is a melody
Everywhere , it 's wine and romance
So here 's to us two and liberty !
Run for it , Louis !
Forget about me !
Thanks , Emile !
Look there we can see It 's he , it 's really he .
Let us follow rapidly This way , it 's he
The finish line 's in sight Pedal with all your might
We 're almost home , all right The finish line 's now in sight
Here he comes , yes it 's he
He 's the victor , the celebrity !
Do they fit ?
Like a glove .
Excuse me , sir .
How much ?
I 'll let you have it ...
for 8 francs .
Much too much .
7 francs 50 .
7 francs .
Only because it 's you .
1 0 francs .
7 , 8 , 9 and 1 0 , thank you .
Good day , sir .
Say , mister ...
Got any hankies ?
New ones .
I 'll go check .
Help !
Help !
- I can 't breathe ! - What happened ?
Which way did he go ?
Thataway .
Stop , thief !
Stop , thief !
- What happened ?
- I 've been robbed .
Which way 'd they go ?
Thataway .
You dropped your wallet .
Thank you , it 's really kind of you !

PALACE OF RECORDS
Not at work ?
Don 't you know that ...
Work is mandatory .
Because work means liberty .
Work is mandatory
Because work means liberty .
Let me out !
There are moments when we ponder
The love we have yet to know
The lover who is yet to show
Though silently we hope him yonder
Will I meet this lover some day ?
At what time , in what way ?
Come , my lover to be
I 've loved you since an early date
I 've loved you , though your name is a mystery
It 's you I call , it 's you I await
Love thrives on hope And a touch of folly
All it takes is one look forjoy to start
Come and erase my melancholy
Come and enchant my heart
Come , let me love you and you will love me
Let me read deep in your eyes
Those lines of timeless poetry ...
My uncle 's coming .
When can I see you ?
Can 't you watch out ?
Put your potatoes elsewhere .
Who asked you ?
You don 't know who I am .
That will do .
That will do !
Excuse me , sir ...
Out of my sight !
I forbid you to address my niece .
... walk in formation .
We will give you a job of worth
You who seek an occupation
State your name and date of birth
Leave fingerprint identification
About-face in formation
We will give you a job of worth
Where are you going ?
I want to leave .
So why 'd you come ?
Don 't know what you want , do you ?
Get in line with the others .
Don 't move !
- You 're still here ?
- Let go .
Get going , since you want to leave !
Halt !
Forward , march !
One , two !
It 's not my fault , pal .
- Let me ...
- I 'll get chewed out .
Hold on , you 'll see .
Jeanne !
Leave me alone .
Come now , child , you have to be nice to me .
Look , miss , they 've gone crazy !
What 's wrong ?
You 're crying .
What 's going on ?
I don 't know .
You don 't know .
Did you see anything ?
I don 't get it .
They all jumped on me .
What d 'you have to say ?
I couldn 't place my part ... So I ran after the belt ...
What 's your version ?
He got in my way .
I couldn 't work .
What about you ?
The three of ' em rushed me .
The three of them ?
So you 're one of them ?
It was those two .
They mixed me up .
- So it 's you ?
- Me ?
Not at all . He started it .
He started it all .
Where 'd he go ?
- I don 't know .
- You don 't know ?
Go on !
- Hello , old man .
- Hello , my good man .
Can I help you ?
Don 't you recognize me ?
Not at all .
This must be some joke .
Who is this ?
Don 't remember Emile ?
I get it .
You don 't want them finding out . - Enough !
Move along !
There 's no time to lose .
Just a minute .
This fellow must have something to tell me .
This is quite amusing .
Come with me .
I 'm in a hurry .
I 've got to go .
There 's one more thing we need to know .
Just a minute , gentlemen .
Isn 't this something !
Unheard-of !
What are you doing standing here ?
Run along .
Run along , you two .
And you ?
Will you run along !
Get a move on !
How 's this open ?
What for ?
- To return a hankie .
- Want to start a scandal ?
- That 's not it !
- Listen , Emile !
Stay here .
If you don 't stop by the count of 3, I 'll blow your brains out .
1 ... 2 ...
Will you stop ?
3 .
Come on .
You hurt yourself .
What did you expect ?
Keep quiet !
Take it .
Not enough ?
You want more .
What are you waiting for ?
Let this be the last of you .
So here 's to us two and liberty !
A good likeness .
What a fool !
Not so loud .
What a fool !
What do you think ?
Our friend looks splendid .
Simply splendid !
Doesn 't he ?
How does Louis look to you ?
Magnificent !
Do you mean it ?
This is an outrage .
While her husband works !
They 're not married .
- Not married ?
- She 's a floozy .
And he 's a parvenu .
They 're watching us .
I 'm so sorry , Louis isn 't home yet .
But , dear Madam , we can wait .
It 's late .
You must forgive him . He works so hard .
Everywhere , life is a melody
Everywhere , it 's wine and romance
So here 's to us two and liberty !
Not eating ?
- I am .
- How 's that ?
You sit there staring into space .
Like a wound is my desire
My sorrow knows no bounds
I am so sad I shall expire
You clumsy oaf !
Hold this !
You , too ?
I didn 't get any cake .
I didn 't have any cake . Nothing at all .
I 'm so sorry , believe me .
Good help is hard to find .
It won 't stain .
It 's only sugar and milk .
Don 't go .
That 's enough .
It stopped raining .
Go on .
I 'm so sorry for what happened .
I 'm fed up , fed up !
Listen , darling ...
It 's all set then . See you tomorrow .
Say , my suit looks good on you .
As if it were made for you .
Almost .
But it doesn 't beat that !
Hey , you !
Who d 'you think you are ?
Just you wait !
If I wanted to catch you ...
Your behavior tonight ...
Spare me !
What d 'you want , money ?
Boor !
Just take it and get off my back !
Did you see that ?
So you don 't like it ?
Wait and see .
My turn !
Watch this .
You win !
Everywhere , if you take a chance ,
Everywhere , life is a melody
Everywhere , it 's wine and romance
So here 's to us two and liberty !
What are you doing here ?
Joseph !
How are things ?
Just fine .
Don 't you recognize a friend ?
Coming out of there ?
A friend 's house .
A friend ?
Shall I awaken the master ?
No need to .
See you soon , I hope ...
Sure , but I gotta run .
Where 's the fire ?
Is that the mistress ... leaving ?
Yes , sir .
You don 't say !
What are you standing there for ?
Get inside !
Is this yours ?
We inaugurate our new plant tomorrow .
In the first month , it will turn out daily 2000 models like this one .
In the second month , 3000 ...
What is it ?
What do you want ?
All right .
Gentlemen ...
We 'll continue this later .
He 's overstepped all bounds !
Just who is that man ?
This can 't go on !
What did I tell you ?
Will you get off my back ?
Know who they are ?
Now get out and stay away from the plant .
What do you want ?
Money ?
What then ?
It 's like this ...
I want to stay at the plant .
You can 't . It 's the one place I can 't have you .
Why do you want to stay ?
I 'm in love .
Who with ?
A girl who works at the plant .
Step up , my friend .
Sir ...
Where 's he going ?
- I 'm right here , sir .
- Not you , him !
Step up .
You , too .
Is this your niece ?
Yes , sir .
This gentleman wishes to marry her .
This gentleman is my friend .
Do you understand ?
Perfectly , sir .
The director wants you .
Director ?
The big director .
Don 't worry about money .
Here 's her dowry .
Thank you , sir .
Excuse me .
May I ?
What is it you want ?
Listen .
I just wanted to tell you ...
Nothing .
Would you like to get married ?
Of course she would , sir .
A friend of mine would like to marry you .
Oh , no , sir .
Only the other day , you said so .
I never said ...
Please excuse her , sir . She 's feeling a bit intimidated .
- It 'll work out .
- I count on you .
You needn 't worry .
My friend 's charming .
I know him .
I 'm sure you 'll change your mind , miss .
I doubt it , sir .
Come along .
It 'll work out .
I can 't understand you .
The chance of a lifetime !
Come along , my dear .
Have no fear , she 'll agree to everything .
- Relax . It 'll all work out .
- Thanks .
I 've seen the girl .
I 'll tell you later .
Isn 't that so ?
Of course , sir .
My niece can 't wait to meet you .
I 'm so glad .
If you 'd care to come tonight ...
Do you mind , sir ?
Come tonight ...
That was him !
Yes , your fiance .
Having dinner here ?
No , I have my date .
And I 've got guests .
See you tomorrow .
Tomorrow 's the great day .
I inaugurate my new plant .
And I celebrate my engagement , I hope .
So everything 's fine ?
Firmin !
Joseph !
Where is everyone ?
Dear friends !
What 's going on here ?
You thought of everything !
Going already ?
Let 's do some serious talking .
That 's what we came for .
Will that do ?
It 'll do .
Don 't bother !
If we blab , you lose everything .
Your status . Your fortune . That 's what you 're gonna share with us .
So that 's it !
Is that all ?
What brings you gentlemen here ?
How 's that ?
We received a report on a housebreaking .
Housebreaking !
But it 's a practical joke played by my friends .
You came for nothing .
Please forgive them .
But I was tied hand and foot !
I was doing my duty .
As you always do .
- What are you doing here ?
- Papers !
Is this a joke ?
We 're done for .
He took us for a ride .
We can 't get out .
Trapped like rats !
We can 't stay here !
Isn 't there a combination ?
Things look bad .
- What is it ?
- They 'll blow the whistle on me .
So what ?
We have to get ready to run .
- What was that ?
- The police are after me .
You idiot !
Shut the door , quick !
May I help you ?
It 's nothing , sir , but a man 's slipped into the plant .
A man ?
We 're looking for him .
I haven 't seen a soul .
But be my guest , have a good look .
You took the case ?
The case I put here .
I just saw a guy with it !
What are you doing here ?
We 're friends of the director .
Sure !
We came with him tonight .
That 's right .
Isn 't that right ?
- He 's a pal .
- Aren 't you ?
Is that all you have to say ?
If you don 't speak up , they 'll arrest us .
But you 'll be joining us soon .
Be seeing you , then .
Goodbye .
Here , Inspector , look at this .
We 'll look at it later .
Take ' em away !
Let 's move it !
In our new plant , men will have no other task other than supervising the machines .
The machines will do all the work .
They will manufacture our phonographs .
" Organization and progress , " that is our motto .
This explains the success of our earlier factories . It will be the same under our new enterprise , which will now start up before your very eyes .
Won 't you cut the garland ?
Won 't you cut this garland ?
Cut it ?
Step over here .
All hail Progress , child of Science
Which extends its hand to the future
The golden torch of hope ...
It 's very simple :
We introduce the materials there .
We stand back and then ...
There you have it !
It guides its sister , Human Intelligence ,
Towards the sunlight ...
My congratulations !
It 's marvelous !
Ladies and gentlemen ...
On this solemn occasion , when the Machine has proven that if it can replace the hand of man , it cannot replace his brain , allow me first to pay homage to the brilliant creator behind the destiny of this magnificent factory .
This man who , despite humble beginnings , forged a place for himself , and earned the respect of his contemporaries , whose name is forever linked with phonograph history , this philanthropist , this great citizen ...
This scoundrel ! This riffraff !
It 's him , all right .
- You recognize him ?
- You bet I do .
I arrested him .
If you want to arrest him again , you 'd better hurry .
He 's been tipped off .
He 'll make a run for it .
All right .
Get down there .
This historic moment , when the fiery gaze of the future looks back on the dazzling flame of the present .
I haven 't said everything .
Gentlemen , the opening of this factory is my crowning achievement . I have nothing more to do among you .
I am leaving you .
I hereby make a gift of my factories to all whose who have worked with me .
The machines will now work for them .
Destiny beckons me to other paths .
As a great poet once wrote :
" Let us raise our souls and our hearts
" As the mother raises her child . "
These words come to mind on this day when I wish ...
We can lift our heads high and declare that the future destiny of mankind seems to bear great promise .
We will soon taste the fruit ...
When all things around us operate
Friends , let us enjoy our idleness
Beneath sunny skies what a sweet fate
To laze about and sing like this
Let 's indulge in this infinite elation
It takes one kiss for it to start
My whole being finds exhiliration
In the gentle beating of your heart
You must never think of marrying When you were born to live on the road
While awaiting the wisdom age may bring Think of love as a mere episode
That 's our fate
Old mate
My old friend , the Earth is round
There are women wherever you go
When we finally run out of ground That 's the time to take it slow
Everywhere , if you take a chance
Everywhere , life is a melody
Everywhere , it 's wine and romance
So here 's to us two and liberty !
Come in .
- What is it , Poole ?
- It 's 2 : 45 , sir ... and your address at the University is at 3 : 00 .
So it is , Poole .
- You know , Poole ? You 're a nuisance .
- Yes , sir .
But I don 't know what I should do without you .
Thank you , sir .
Your sense of duty is as impregnable as Gibraltar .
- Even Bach can 't move it .
- Yes , sir .
Thank you , sir .
I 'm afraid you 'll be late , sir .
I see you want to get rid of me .
All right , Poole .
They 're lovely roses , Poole .
Thank you , sir .
- Will you wear your overcoat or cape , sir ?
- Give me my cape .
- Good afternoon , Jasper .
- Good afternoon , sir .
- Nice day , isn 't it ?
- Isn 't it , sir ?
- St. Simon 's .
- Yes , sir .
Constable .
- How are you , sir ?
- Very good .
Thank you , sir .
I won 't need you anymore today , Jasper .
Dr. Lanyon will take me where I 'm going later .
Yes , sir .
- How do you do , Dr. Jekyll ?
- How do you do ?
- Hello , Hampton .
- Afternoon , sir .
The auditorium 's full , sir .
It always is when you speak , sir .
Flattery !
- I hope Jekyll 's in form today .
- He 's always in form .
The old codgers are in for another jolt .
I 'd wager your friend has something up his sleeve again , Dr. Lanyon .
Jekyll is always sensational , always indulging in spectacular theories .
Gentlemen ...
London is so full of fog ... that it has penetrated our minds ... set boundaries for our vision .
As men of science , we should be curious ... and bold enough to peer beyond it ... into the many wonders it conceals .
I shall not dwell today on the secrets of the human body ... in sickness and in health .
Today , I want to talk to you of a greater marvel :
The soul of man .
My analysis of this soul , the human psyche ... leads me to believe that man is not truly one ... but truly two .
One of him strives for the nobilities of life .
This we call his good self .
The other seeks an expression of impulses ... that bind him to some dim animal relation with the earth .
This , we may call the bad .
These two carry out an eternal struggle in the nature of man ... yet they are chained together .
And that chain spells repression to the evil .
Remorse to the good .
Now , if these two selves could be separated from each other ... how much freer the good in us would be .
What heights it might scale .
And the so-called evil , once liberated ... would fulfill itself and trouble us no more .
I believe the day is not far off ... when this separation will be possible .
In my experiments , I have found ... that certain chemicals have the power ...
Tell me , he can split me in two like a jolly amoeba .
- By Jove , it 's marvelous .
- I confess it 's too much for me .
Why don 't you stay at home and send your other self to the lecture ?
To divide a human being in two ?
Ridiculous !
I 'm going to try to analyze my psyche .
- I didn 't expect you to agree with me .
- Agree with you ?
You talk like a lunatic .
But I hope you 're sane enough to remember ... that we have a consultation at the Duchess of Densmore 's .
- I 'm not going .
- What ?
Please give the duchess my compliments and some castor oil .
I saw her yesterday .
She 's a bit bilious , more in spirit than in body , I 'm afraid .
- I 'm going along the free wards .
- My dear fellow , be reasonable .
You know how insistent the duchess was on your coming .
You can 't neglect her for a lot of charity cases .
Can 't I ?
It 's the things one can 't do that always tempt me .
Just as you like .
But you 'll remember we 're having dinner at the Carews ' tonight .
- I 'll pick you up later .
- Thanks .
You 'll find me in the wards .
See you at 9 : 00 .
Mary , what are you doing with those crutches ?
I can 't do without them , sir .
Yes , you can do without them , Mary .
I told you yesterday .
Believe me , I can 't do anything for you .
I believe you , sir ... but I can 't walk without them , sir .
Yes , you can .
Give them to me .
Don 't be afraid .
Now walk , Mary .
Come on .
Come to me .
Yes , sir .
Walk , Mary .
Come on .
All right , sir .
I can walk , sir .
- Of course you can .
- I can walk , sir !
There , there , Mrs. Lucas .
- It hurts , doesn 't it ?
- Yes , sir .
Sometimes a doctor must hurt you a little to make you well .
Yes , sir .
And if a doctor thinks a slight operation is necessary ... there 's no need to be afraid , is there ?
- No , sir .
- I want you to know it 's going to cure you .
I believe you , sir .
Jekyll , we haven 't much time , you know .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm afraid I must miss the dinner .
I 'll come afterwards for the dancing .
- What 's keeping you ?
- I must operate on this patient at once .
Why not leave it to one of the house surgeons ?
They 're quite competent .
Perhaps , but I prefer to do it myself .
Will you make my excuses to General Carew and Muriel , please ?
As you like .
Lanyon , you make my excuses to the General ... and I 'll make mine to Muriel myself .
All right .
Yes , Miss Muriel .
Will it be almond cakes with coffee , Hobson ?
- I 'm sorry , miss . I don 't think so .
- But we must have almond cakes .
- Send for them immediately .
- Very good , miss .
- What 's this about almond cakes ?
- Dr. Jekyll likes them , Father .
You know you 'll spoil that fiancé of yours .
- I like spoiling him .
- So I observe .
And what about your father ?
You 're already the most spoiled darling in the world .
Dr. Lanyon .
Lanyon .
Delighted to see you .
Punctual for dinner , punctual in everything .
How do you do , sir ?
- What an astonishing motto .
- How do you do ?
- Where 's Jekyll ?
- He stayed to perform an operation .
- Isn 't he coming ?
- He will be in after dinner .
He asked me to make his excuses .
I hope the patient is worthy of Jekyll 's attention .
- A woman in the free wards .
- Free ward .
Jekyll gives entirely too much time to his charity patients .
I love him for that .
Nonsense , my dear .
He ought to come down to earth .
- Mr. Utterson .
- Utterson .
However , I promised Harry the first waltz .
If he 's late , I shall be furious with him .
No .
You know , I 'm very glad Jekyll is late .
I 'm obliged to him for a most delightful waltz .
Thank you .
Hello , General .
I 'm very sorry to be late , sir .
Repentance is a virtue , Jekyll , but it 's better to be punctual .
In 40 years , I 've never been late for dinner .
It 's indeed a remarkable record , sir .
Merely a matter of training , my boy .
At the age of ...
General , you 've not forgotten this is our dance ?
Certainly not , Lady Dakin .
I 've been looking forward to it .
See you later , Jekyll .
May I ?
- I shouldn 't .
- But you will .
- Was she pretty ?
- Ravishing .
- Who ?
- Your patient .
I was thinking of someone else .
Someone to make you late again ?
- Are you chiding me ?
- Of course .
- Because you hate me ?
- Of course , silly .
Then , will you come into the garden where I can bear it ?
- Certainly not .
- Why not ?
- Father .
He 'd be furious .
- It would do him good .
He 's not looking .
He 's teaching Lady Dakin how to waltz .
- Can 't stay long .
- Just forever .
Not even half as long as that .
Now , my farthing , chide me , mock me , hate me ... but don 't send me away .
Silly .
Are you sorry you were late ?
- No .
- You 're not ?
- If I wasn 't late , you wouldn 't have pouted .
- I won 't forgive ...
If you hadn 't pouted , you wouldn 't have looked so pretty .
Do you talk this way to your patients ?
If you hadn 't looked so pretty , I might have postponed ...
- Pardon me .
- Not another word .
Well ?
I might have postponed telling you that I love you so much ... and I don 't want to wait any longer .
I want you to marry me now .
Darling , I want to with all my heart .
You know I do .
But Father 's so difficult .
I don 't want to marry your father .
I don 't mind having a difficult father-in-law .
You 'll be worth it , my darling .
I don 't think you love me seriously .
I love you better than that .
I love you gaily , happily , high-heartedly .
I love you so much that I could laugh and sing and ...
I shouldn 't spoil it by trying to sing .
My darling , I shall persuade your father to let us marry now .
I can 't wait any longer .
We shall go to Devon for our honeymoon and live on love and strawberries ... and the sight of the sea .
- And moonlight .
- Endless moonlight .
I do love you seriously .
So seriously that it frightens me .
You 've opened a gate for me into another world .
Before that , my work was everything .
I was drawn to the mysteries of science , to the unknown .
But now , the unknown wears your face ... looks back at me with your eyes .
Darling , I wish this moment would last forever .
You can make it last , dear .
I love you .
Be near me always .
Always you and I.
Apart from the world .
I love you , darling .
I love you .
Then who shall ever separate us ?
- My sweet friend .
- My love .
You ought to wear squeaky shoes , Hobson .
Yes , sir .
Thank you , sir .
The General asks you to come into the house , miss .
- Your guests are inquiring about you .
- Coming , Hobson .
- Glad you came .
- Good night , Muriel .
- You looked perfectly lovely tonight .
- Thank you .
- Good-bye , my dear .
- Good night , General .
I don 't know when I 've enjoyed myself so much .
- I 'll see you at tea tomorrow , dear .
- Yes .
I won 't forget , Lady Dakin .
- Good night .
- Good night .
Jekyll , my boy .
Waiting to see me ?
I beg your pardon , sir , but you would make us very happy ... if you 'd set an earlier date for our wedding .
I 've already announced to you ... that you would be married on the anniversary of my own wedding .
- That 's eight months from now , sir .
- What of it ?
We 've already been engaged two months , sir .
We see no reason to ...
I presume I have some rights in the matter .
- Quite right .
That 's why we 're asking you .
- Why this impatience ?
It isn 't done .
I 'm sorry , sir , but I cannot regard that as a serious objection .
Do you hear this , Lanyon ?
Is this another evidence of your eccentricity ?
If it is eccentric to be impatient in love , sir , I am .
This is positively indecent .
Father , do you think it fair to keep us apart for so long ?
- I waited five years for your mother .
- You have a sturdy temperament , General .
Yes , I pride myself on it .
Please don 't make me wait that long for Muriel .
Now , my boy , you must leave these matters to me .
There 's such a thing as decent observance , you know .
- Good night .
- Good night , sir .
- Good night , Lanyon .
- Good night , sir .
Au revoir , my sweet .
Come , Lanyon .
- Good night , Muriel .
- Good night .
- I 'm afraid you offended the General .
- Offended him ?
It 's a pity I didn 't strangle the old walrus .
Did you hear him ? " Wait ! "
What the devil does one wait for ?
I hope the responsibilities of marriage will sober you up .
I 'm not marrying to be sober .
I 'm marrying to be drunk .
- Drunk with love and life and experiments .
- Your experiments are absurd .
You have no interest in science at all .
You have no dreams , no curiosities .
There are bounds beyond which one should not go .
Yes .
It isn 't done , I suppose .
I tell you , there are no bounds , Lanyon .
Look at that gas lamp .
But for some man 's curiosity , we shouldn 't have had it .
London would still be lighted by linkboys .
And wait .
One day , London will glow with incandescence ... and will be so beautiful that even you will be moved by it .
I find London quite satisfactory as it is ... and I 'm not interested in your shortcuts and your byways .
But it 's in the byways that the secrets and wonders lie :
In science and in life .
Look at the ...
Fine , you big brute , hit me !
I 'll put the police on you !
Are you badly hurt ?
Where does this girl live ?
First door on the left at the top of the stairs .
Bring her up here .
Make way for the governor .
Have you got her , governor ?
- Right up here ?
- Yes .
Look out for her head .
Shut up , you lot !
What was this all about ?
- One of Ivy Pearson 's callers ...
- I can tell you ...
Now shut up !
One of Ivy ...
That swine .
Hit me , will he ?
He 'll wish he hadn 't !
I ain 't afraid of him , I ain 't .
Blast his dirty mug !
He 's killed me , that 's what he 's done .
He 's broken me jaw and me knee , too .
I 'll get him for this !
Look where he kicked me .
It 's only a bruise .
It will be quite well in a few days .
Either way , you mustn 't wear so tight a garter .
It 's bad for you .
It impedes the circulation .
It 's awful kind of you to look after me .
Anybody can see now that you 're a real gent , you are .
Now you 're the kind a woman would do something for .
- What is it ?
- He 's hit me here , too , the blighter .
He 's broken me rib .
That 's what he 's done .
I 'm going to faint .
You 're not seriously hurt .
A bit of rest would do you no harm , though .
You think I ought to go to bed ?
I know of no better place for a rest .
All right .
You turn your eyes away now .
How is the pain now ?
I say !
Lanyon .
Coming .
I 'm a doctor , you know , and I 'll call that kiss my fee .
Well ?
Come back soon , won 't you ?
- Sorry . I 'm afraid I can 't .
- Yes , you can .
Soon .
- Good night .
- Come back .
Come back soon , won 't you ?
Yes , you can .
Soon , come back ...
- I thought your conduct quite disgusting .
- Conduct ?
Why , a pretty girl kissed me .
Should I have called the constable ?
- Even suppose I 'd liked it .
- What ?
Yes .
That 's not a matter of conduct , but of elementary instinct .
You ought to control those instincts .
Are you pretending that you either can or do ?
We may control our actions , but not our impulses .
Perhaps you 've forgotten you 're engaged to Muriel .
Forgotten it ?
Can a man dying of thirst forget water ?
Did you know what would happen to that thirst if it were denied water ?
If I understand you correctly , you sound almost indecent .
What names you give things .
Why aren 't you frank enough to admit that other indecent self in you ?
No .
You prefer to hide it , pretend it isn 't there .
- You have to accept certain things .
- I don 't want to accept .
I want to be clean , not only in my conduct , but in my innermost thoughts and desires .
- There 's only one way to do it .
- How ?
- Separate the two natures in us .
- That absurd theory of yours .
I tell you , it 's unscientific not to admit the possibility of anything .
You 're mad .
Mad , Lanyon ?
We 'll see .
Come in .
What is it , Poole ?
Begging your pardon for the intrusion , sir , but did you sleep last night , sir ?
Don 't worry about me .
Yes , sir , but you had only a cup of tea for breakfast for three days .
Your health !
Now , Poole , you didn 't come here to inquire after my health , did you ?
One of General Carew 's servants brought this , sir .
Miss Muriel is scolding me for having missed her dinner last night .
Go and tell her that I shall come to dinner tomorrow night .
Very good , sir .
Marry me now .
I cannot wait any longer .
Positively indecent .
Look where he kicked me .
Your conduct was disgusting .
It isn 't done !
Pity I didn 't strangle him .
Strangle him !
Indecent !
Can a man dying of thirst forget water ?
Disgusting .
You 're mad .
Come back soon , won 't you ?
Come back .
Free !
Free at last !
Mad , Lanyon ?
Carew ?
You hypocrites , deniers of life .
If you could see me now ... what would you think ?
- Who is it ?
- Who is there ?
Dr. Jekyll , sir .
Is that you ?
Do you hear me , sir ?
Please let me in , sir !
I beg your pardon , sir .
I thought I heard a strange voice .
That 's quite all right .
There was someone here .
A friend of mine .
His name is Hyde .
Mr. Hyde .
He 's just gone out the back door .
Marry me now , my darling .
You don 't know how much I need you .
I want to with all my heart , but Father ...
- I 'll speak to him .
I 'll convince him .
- No . Let me talk to him .
I 'll try to change his mind while we 're away .
- Away ?
- Yes .
Darling , I 've dreaded telling you ... but Father 's taking me to Bath tomorrow .
He has no right to take you away from me .
Why must we put up with this ?
- You want to marry me ?
- With all my heart .
We 'll marry without his consent .
Say you will , my darling .
We 'll go to Paris for our honeymoon .
We 'll be so gloriously happy ... that even the French will be jealous of us .
I 'm so thrilled and tempted , but I don 't want to hurt my father .
It 's only a little hurt to his vanity .
You 'll do me a greater hurt if you refuse .
Do be patient , just a little while .
I 'm sure I can persuade him while we 're gone .
- Darling , don 't you love me enough ... to wait a little while ?
- But , Muriel ...
Of course I love you enough , dear .
And I 'll wait .
And wait .
Come in .
A letter from Bath , sir .
Miss Muriel won 't be home for another month .
- Can 't even go to see her .
- I 'm sorry to hear it , sir .
- Another month .
- I beg your pardon , sir ... but may I suggest that you ought to amuse yourself .
Amuse myself ?
What do you suggest , Poole ?
You ought to go out , sir .
London offers many amusements for a gentleman like you , sir .
Yes , but a gentleman like me daren 't take advantage of them .
Gentlemen like me must be very careful of what they do and say .
- That 's all .
- Yes , sir .
Here !
What are you after down there ?
I was calling on the young lady who occupies the little nest .
If it 's Ivy Pearson you mean , she ain 't in .
Do you know where I can find her ?
If I was wanting her , I 'd try the Variety Music Hall .
I thank you !
You get out !
What do you take me for ?
Get out !
- Stay out !
- I didn 't do nothing .
Bottle of champagne and be quick about it .
- What are you staring at ?
- Nothing , sir .
What are you waiting for ?
A tip ? Get out !
Blighter .
- I 'm sorry , sir .
- You swine !
He 's a rum one .
Let 's have a drink .
I will .
You 're a bit of something to look at and listen to , dearie .
Not half bad , so they say .
- You ain 't conceited , are you ?
- I has me points .
- Charlie !
- Blimey , there 's Irv .
I 'll be back .
Hey , you !
Tell that wenching brat to come over and have a bottle of wine with me .
- Yes , sir .
- That 's right .
The gent there wants you to have wine with him .
He does , does he ?
What of it ?
Come if you know what 's good for you .
He ain 't one to be trifled with .
Strike me pink .
You interest me .
I 'll take a chance .
- Where is he ?
- I 'll take you to him .
This is indeed a great honor .
I noticed you as you came in , my dear .
" There , " I said to myself ...
" is too pretty a girl to waste on such a companion . "
But you are pretty .
And what a figure , my dear .
A glass of champagne .
To you , my dear .
To your beauty .
- I must be going now .
- Going .
Where ?
- Home .
- You call that home ?
- That pigsty of yours in Diadem Court .
- Sty , is it ?
You come off that .
I like you when your temper 's up , my dear .
How do you know where I live ?
I saw you on the street and followed you .
My pretty , you deserve better than that .
You ought to live in a place worthy of you .
Buckingham Palace , I suppose .
That 's the spirit I like .
Sit down , my dear . Sit down just for a moment .
You should have a place that would set off that fine body of yours ... yellow hair and pale face .
Clothes to match , too , my dear .
Silk , eh ?
And a bracelet , too ?
Champagne to drink ?
How would you like that ?
And how am I to get it ?
How do you think you 're going to get it , my bright little bird ?
I am no gentleman , no , but I have money .
Perhaps my looks don 't please you .
- You ain 't no beauty .
- Quite right .
I am no beauty .
Perhaps you prefer a gentleman ?
One of those fine-mannered , virtuous , and honorable gentlemen .
One of those canting hypocrites who like your legs ... but talk about your garter .
What are you talking about ?
My poor little innocent .
It doesn 't know what I 'm talking about .
Well , it 's afraid of me , isn 't it ?
- No ! I ain 't afraid of you .
- Aren 't you ?
Good .
Hey , you .
Trying to steal my girl , are you , you dirty blighter ?
- Come back , you .
I 'll fix you ...
- Sit down !
- I 'll knock your blooming ...
- Get out of here , you !
- You couldn 't have done it .
- Couldn 't I , though ?
Why not ?
This place was just made for it .
- Come on .
- Stop that .
Let me go .
- No .
You 're not going .
- Let me go !
I 'm going !
I 'm going home !
Sit down !
Forgive me , my dear .
You see , I hurt you because I love you .
I want you ... and what I want , I get .
I grant you , I am no beauty ... but under this exterior ... you 'll find a very flower of man .
Look at me .
Do you suppose I 'd let anybody stand in my way ?
I love you .
I love you .
Do you understand ?
You 'll come with me ?
You 'll come with me .
Come in , sir .
- I presume your master is out . - Yes , sir .
So he is , sir .
He 's always out when I call .
Tell your master I 've had a letter from General Carew .
He tells me that Dr. Jekyll has not replied to any of Miss Muriel 's letters .
- She 's worried about him .
- I 'll tell him , sir .
Anyway , I 'm relieved to know he 's not confined to his bed .
Begging your pardon , sir , it 's my opinion that my master isn 't well .
He hardly sees his patients , sir .
I haven 't seen him myself for days at a time .
He often comes and goes by the back door of the laboratory , sir .
I must be going , Poole .
Good day .
- Who 's there ?
- It 's me , dearie , your landlady .
Come in , Mrs. Hawkins .
How are you , dearie ?
You don 't have to answer .
I can see for myself you ain 't as fit as you ought to be ... and no wonder .
- Here , I brought you the newspaper .
- Thank you , Mrs. Hawkins .
You 're having a cup of tea , I see .
If you don 't mind , dearie , I 'll sit with you a minute .
I 'm that done in .
Will you have a cup of tea , Mrs. Hawkins ?
Thank you , dearie .
I don 't mind if I do .
After all , a neighbor 's a neighbor , says I.
Here 's a bit of a surprise for you .
He 's a lodger of mine , and a very likely lad he is , too .
His name 's Arvis , and he says to me , says he :
" Who 's the pretty lass what has the parlor ?
" I wonder if she 'd be inclined to drop in at the music hall with me ...
" one of these fine nights .
" You ask her , " says he .
Now , my advice , dearie ...
No . I don 't want to hear anymore about it .
Afraid of what Hyde will do to you , ain 't you ?
No , I ain 't afraid .
If that blighter was my man , he wouldn 't dare to lay a hand on me ... not if he knowed what was good for him .
He 's a brute , that 's what he is , and my advice , dearie ...
- What do you want ?
- I 've come for the rent , sir .
- You 'll get it when it 's due .
- Very good , sir .
What did that filthy harridan want ?
She brought me the paper .
- What else ?
- Nothing .
You aren 't lying to me , are you , my little bird ?
No , I ain 't lying to you .
If I ever catch you lying ... these are a trifle to what you 'll get .
A trifle !
Come here .
Sit down so that I can look at you , my sweetling .
- Say it aloud .
- What do you mean ?
Don 't you think I can read your thoughts , you trull ?
You hate me , don 't you ?
I 'm not good enough for you !
I 'm not a nice , kind gentleman like that ...
Nice , kind gentlemen who are so good to look at and so ...
Cowards !
Weaklings !
Tell me you hate me .
Please , my lamb .
My dear , sweet , pretty little bird , tell me that you hate me .
- I don 't know what you mean .
- Don 't you , my lamb ?
- Then you don 't hate me ?
- No , sir .
If you don 't hate me , you must love me .
- Isn 't that so , my little one ?
Isn 't it ? - Yes , sir .
How you must love me .
I want to hear you say it .
- Say it .
Come , my wench .
Say it !
- Yes , sir !
Of course .
I 've got bad news for you , my dear .
Very bad .
I 'm going away for a few days .
And upon my word , if you don 't seem pleased .
- And you are pleased , aren 't you ?
- No , sir , I ain 't pleased .
You are pleased !
But pleasure is brief in this world , my sweet ... and yours is most uncertain ... because you don 't know when I 'll be back .
- No , sir .
- " No , sir . "
Remember , you belong to me , do you hear ?
If you do one thing that I don 't approve of while I 'm gone ... the least little thing , mind you ... I 'll show you what horror means .
Are you going now ?
- Tonight ?
- Now .
Why , my dear , I 'm surprised at you .
What a leave-taking that would be .
You wouldn 't have me go tonight , would you ?
Would you let me go tonight ?
Would you ?
- No , sir .
- Of course not .
Quite unworthy of our great love .
No , my dear , I 'm not going now .
I 'm going to spend the evening here with you just as you want .
Say , " Just as I want . "
- " Just as I want . "
- That 's right , my little bird .
The last evening is always the sweetest , you know .
And what a farewell this one will be .
What a farewell .
I don 't know whether I shall be able to tear myself away from you .
Perhaps I shall go only as far as the door ... and the sight of your tears will bring me back .
- Does that please you , my dear ?
- Yes , sir .
Why don 't you show it , then ?
Why don 't you dance ?
Why don 't you sing ?
Sing , my dear !
Sing , my little pigeon !
Get up and sing !
You hear ?
Look , my darling , how tight your garter is .
You mustn 't wear it so tight .
It will bruise your pretty , tender flesh .
Your tea , sir .
Thank you , Poole .
I shall be going out presently .
- Miss Muriel is returning to London today .
- Very good , sir .
- See this key , Poole ? - Yes , sir .
It 's the key to the back door of the laboratory , sir .
I 'll have no further use for it .
From now on , I 'll use only the front door .
Yes , sir .
Deliver this to Miss Ivy Pearson , Diadem Court , Soho .
- Any message , sir ?
- None .
Deliver it and come away .
- Hyde 'll kill you one day .
- I wish he would kill me .
I wish he would .
Why don 't you run away ?
Where to ?
He 'd find me wherever I was .
Then why don 't you go to the police ?
They 'd fix this Hyde man .
No .
I 'm afraid .
There ain 't nobody to help me .
Nobody .
Who cares what becomes of the likes of me ?
Come in .
Miss Ivy Pearson ?
- That 's me .
- This is from my master , Dr. Jekyll , miss .
- Not Dr. Henry L. Jekyll ?
- Quite so .
He said there is no answer .
Good day , miss .
I don 't know Dr. Jekyll .
Fifty pounds !
Well , he knows you , dearie .
Strike me pink !
Fifty pounds from the celebrated Dr. Jekyll .
He 's a grand gentleman , always helping them what needs help .
Now , dearie , he sends you fifty pounds ... shows he takes an interest in you .
Why don 't you go and thank the gentleman proper ?
Then you could tell him all about this here Hyde business .
He 'll tell that blighter what 's what .
You 'll see if he don 't .
You made me suffer so .
Now you tell me nothing .
I tell you no man ever needed another or loved another ... as I need and love you .
I don 't know what to say ... but if you 'd been ill that would have been different .
I was ill , my darling .
Why didn 't you let me know ?
I should have come at once .
I wasn 't ill in body .
I was ill in soul .
The sufferings of the spirit are so difficult to communicate ... even to those who love you .
Do you think there 's anything that has to do with you that I wouldn 't understand ?
I know that you 're gentle and understanding , but ...
I can 't explain to you .
I 've played with dangerous knowledge .
I 've walked a strange and terrible road .
Help me to find my way back .
Oh , my sweet .
When you 're all mine to love and keep ... I shall be patient as the earth with you .
Then let 's not wait any longer .
Let us be married at once .
I want to with all my heart .
Take me .
Take me soon .
I love you , and I want to help you .
Muriel .
I didn 't expect to find you here , sir .
I 've just made my profoundest apologies to Muriel .
- What about me ? - Permit me to make them to you , sir ... and to trust that you will be indulgent .
You haven 't explained anything yet , sir .
I was not quite myself , sir .
I was ill .
Ill ?
In that case , of course , we 'll say no more about it .
Thank you , sir .
May I take further advantage of your indulgence ?
- Yes .
What is it ?
- Your consent to our early marriage .
Please , Father .
Do say yes . Harry needs me .
- I 've already told you .
- We 're too unhappy apart .
Please , Father .
This is the most important request of my life .
- I see no reason to change my mind .
- Isn 't my happiness reason enough ?
I assure you , sir , you will have no cause to regret it .
To be frank , Jekyll , I 'm not at all satisfied with your conduct .
- I don 't understand you , sir .
- I expect a man in your position ... to observe certain traditions .
I want to see you more settled down before I entrust my daughter to your care .
You 're too flighty , too impatient ...
Believe me , these faults will be corrected .
- I give you my word of honor .
- Please , Father .
My whole life is concerned .
Please .
Well , I see you 're overriding me .
Jekyll , remember you gave me your word of honor .
Yes , sir .
Very well .
You shall be married next month .
Come to dinner tomorrow and we 'll make a formal announcement to our friends .
Thank you , sir .
By Jove , you 've made me happy !
- I could sing or dance or roll a hoop ...
- Jekyll , no .
I beg your pardon , sir .
Until tomorrow , my sweet .
- Good-bye , sir .
- Good-bye .
Poole , my dear fellow !
- I 'm a very happy man !
- I 'm happy to hear it !
Happy , by Jove !
Happy !
" ... jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . "
Yes , sir .
May I take your cape , sir ?
You may , Poole .
You may , my dear fellow .
I 'm going to be married , Poole .
In a few weeks , she 'll be under this very roof ... in this very room , as my wife . Next month .
Think of it . Think of it , Poole , and let me see your face .
Yes , sir !
I beg to congratulate you , sir !
- " If music be the food of love , play on . "
- Yes .
I beg your pardon , sir ... but Miss Pearson is waiting for you in the consulting room .
Miss Pearson ?
The young woman as you sent the envelope to , sir .
- What does she want ?
- She wishes to consult you , sir .
- Very well .
Show her in here .
- Yes , sir .
- Why , it 's you , sir !
- So it is .
Now who would have thought it ?
Who would have thought that I 'd find the celebrated Dr. Jekyll ?
- So it was you who sent me this money .
- Yes .
The minute I laid eyes on you , I knew you had a kind heart .
- But whatever made you do it , sir ?
- Someone told me that you needed it .
- Who , sir ?
- It doesn 't matter .
The important thing is that you have it .
And you 're welcome to it .
I can 't take it , sir .
- Why not ?
- Why ?
Here 's why !
Pretty , ain 't it ?
It 's a whip , that 's what it is .
Horrible !
I 'll give you a lotion to soothe that .
Thank you , sir , but a lotion won 't do the trick , sir .
No , sir .
It 's more than that , sir .
I need help , I do .
I can 't stand it anymore .
- What is it , my dear ?
- It 's Hyde , sir .
It 's him that 's done that , and more as I can 't tell you , sir .
He ain 't human , sir .
He 's a beast .
He won 't let me go , and I 'm afraid to run away .
I 've tried to drown myself , but I can 't !
And if you don 't help me ... you as had the kindest heart in the world , sir ... then give me poison so I can kill myself !
- Why didn 't you go to the police ?
- I was afraid .
You don 't know him , sir .
He ain 't a man .
He 's a devil .
He knows what you 're thinking about .
I 'm afraid of him now !
If he knows as I 've been here today , I don 't know what he 'll do !
It won 't be anything human , sir !
Save me !
Keep him off me !
I 'll do anything you ask !
I 'll be your slave .
Help me !
You are good , you are .
You won 't let me go back to him , will you , sir ?
You 're an angel .
I 'll do anything you like .
I ain 't as bad as you think ... and I ain 't a bad looker , either .
I 'll work for you . I 'll slave for you .
I 'll love you .
You liked me once , didn 't you ?
Why don 't you ...
I give you my word that you will never be troubled with Hyde again .
No , sir !
He 'll come back and kill me , sir !
He 'll not come back .
I 'll see to it .
But you don 't know him , sir .
He ain 't human , he ain 't .
I 've given you my word , and that I never break .
You 'll not see Hyde again .
Believe me .
I believe you , sir .
- You must go now .
- Yes , sir .
Begging your pardon , sir , will it be a large affair ?
Not particularly .
General Carew 's cronies , chiefly .
They wouldn 't regard the marriage as authentic ... unless it were formally announced at a dinner table , you know ?
Perhaps soon you 'll be giving a formal dinner yourself , sir .
I may , Poole .
- Should I call the hansom , sir ?
- No , thank you .
- A walk through the park will do me good .
- Yes .
- We 're early .
- I 'm glad you are .
My dear , of course , I wish you all happiness .
- Thank you , Dr. Lanyon .
- How are you , General ?
" Thou wast not born for death , immortal bird ! "
" No hungry generations tread thee down ... "
" Thou wast not born for death ... "
No !
" Thou wast not born for death ... "
Oh , no .
But it is dead !
Rather late .
- It 's very queer , I did not hear .
- I do not understand .
Of course , he is a very busy man .
He was probably detained .
Could anything have happened to Harry , Mr. Utterson ?
On a night like this , my dear ?
Nonsense .
Why is he late , then ?
There , my dear .
It 's not his lateness .
It 's your impatience .
He 'll be along presently .
I hope so .
Here 's hoping that Hyde rots wherever he is ... and burns where he ought to be .
And here 's hoping that Dr. Jekyll ... will think of Ivy once in a while .
He 's an angel , he is .
Here 's to you , my angel .
Thought I wouldn 't come back , didn 't you ?
You took the word of that sniveling hypocrite Jekyll against mine .
Jekyll 's word against Hyde 's ?
I know everything you do and everything you think !
You went down on your knees before him ... the man I hate more than anybody in the world !
- No !
- No ?
" I 'll slave for you .
I 'll love you .
" You 're an angel , sir . "
You wanted him to love you , didn 't you ?
I 'll give you a lover now .
- His name is death !
- No !
It ain 't so !
Ain 't it so , my little bird ?
My little starling .
Why , you lying wench !
You 've got his money here now !
You must be the devil .
There was nobody there but me and Dr. Jekyll .
He wouldn 't have told you !
No , he wouldn 't !
Wouldn 't he , though ?
Wouldn 't he ?
Listen , my dear .
I 'm going to let you into a secret .
A secret so great ... that those who share it with me cannot live !
I am the angel whom you wanted to slave for and love !
And I 'm going to take you in my arms now and hold you close !
Close , my little lamb .
My dove !
My bird !
There , my sweet .
There , my dove .
There , my little bride .
Isn 't Hyde a lover after your own heart ?
There 's something horrible happening up there !
- Did you hear it ?
- Come on .
- You murdering devil !
- Help !
Stop him !
- The monster did this .
- I know him .
His name is Hyde .
- Let me in .
I 'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll 's .
- He isn 't at home !
I know it , you fool !
He told me to wait for him .
- You 'll have to come back later !
- Open that door , or I 'll break it in !
My dear , I can 't tell you how sorry I am ... but I hope with all my heart that Jekyll will have something to say for himself .
- Good night , sir .
- Good night , Lanyon .
I 'll cane that scoundrel Jekyll if I ever set eyes on him again .
No , Father .
Something terrible must have happened .
I 'm sure he can explain .
I believe in him .
I forbid you to see this man again .
I love him , Father , and I 'm going to marry him .
Muriel , you will have nothing more to do with that man .
- Give me pencil and paper , quick .
- Yes , sir .
Hey , you .
Be ready to carry a message for me .
Yes , sir .
- Hello , Briggs .
- Good evening , sir .
I beg your pardon , sir .
A messenger brought this a little while ago .
- Really ?
- He said it was very important , sir .
I 'm going out , Briggs , but I 'll be back soon .
Yes , sir .
You may go to bed .
I won 't need you any more tonight .
Thank you , sir .
- I come from Dr. Jekyll .
- Come in .
Have you got it ?
Follow me .
Have you got it ?
Come , sir .
You forget I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance .
I beg your pardon , Dr. Lanyon .
You know what I came for .
Dr. Jekyll sent me .
- It 's important .
A package .
Is it here ?
- Yes .
Here it is , but before I give it to you ... I must be assured of Dr. Jekyll 's safety .
- Where is he ?
- He 's alive and safe .
- I 'll take this to him .
- I 'll go with you .
- I must see for myself that he is safe .
- That is not your concern !
I warn you not to meddle .
Take me to Dr. Jekyll , or you 'll not leave this room .
I warn you , Lanyon , to let me go .
If you make another step towards that door ...
- I 'll shoot .
- You don 't know what you 're doing .
I can 't tell you anything .
Ask Jekyll tomorrow .
I will be sure of Dr. Jekyll 's safety , or I 'll make you answer for it .
For the last time , Lanyon , will you let me go ?
For the last time , no .
Very well , Lanyon .
This will be on your own head .
Now , Lanyon ... will you let me take this glass and leave without further question ?
I 've gone too far not to see this through to the end .
Think before you decide , I tell you !
Do you want to be left as you are ... or do you want your eyes and your soul to be blasted by a sight ... that would stagger the devil himself ?
- I 'm not to be persuaded by this rigmarole .
- Very well , Lanyon .
Remember your vows to your profession .
What you are about to see is a secret you are sworn not to reveal .
You who have sneered at the miracles of science ... you who have denied the power of man to look into his own soul ... you who have derided your superiors .
Look !
I can 't believe what I 've seen .
I don 't understand .
- I 'm in your hands to do with as you wish .
- Horrible .
- I 'm a murderer , Lanyon .
Help me .
- There is no help for you , Jekyll .
You 've committed the supreme blasphemy .
I warned you ... that no man could violate the traditions of his kind and not be damned .
That I still do not believe .
Don 't be my inquisitor , Lanyon .
Don 't judge me . Help me .
I 'm at your mercy .
There is no help for you here or mercy beyond .
You 're a rebel , and see what it has done for you .
You 're in the power of this monster that you 've created .
- I 'll never take that drug again .
- Yes .
But you told me you became that monster tonight ... not of your own accord .
- It will happen again .
- Never .
I 'm sure of it .
- I 'll fight it . I 'll conquer it .
- Too late .
You cannot conquer it .
- It has conquered you .
- No .
I 'll fight it .
I know it will not happen again . Help me .
You 'll promise at least never to mix this drug again ?
With all my heart .
And what about Muriel ?
I 'll give her up .
I 'll go to her tomorrow .
Set her free .
Oh , God ... this I did not intend .
I saw a light , but I could not see where it was leading .
I have trespassed on your domain .
I 've gone further than man should go .
Forgive me .
Help me .
I beg your pardon , sir .
Dr. Jekyll is calling .
- Tell him we 're not at home , Hobson .
- Father , no , for my sake .
He dares to enter this house ?
Neither of us have the right to judge him .
Judge him ?
Are you mad ?
The fellow 's a blackguard .
I won 't hear you say one word against him .
- Show him in , Hobson .
- But I ...
I don 't know what he 's done ... but he 's a finer and greater person than any of us .
- Silence !
I won 't hear another word !
- I shall say it !
We 've never understood him and never tried to understand him .
You tried to bend him to your will .
I haven 't fought for him .
I don 't know what 's happened to him , but I know he 's suffering ... and it 's our fault , mine more than yours .
I love him , and I 'm going to help him .
This is preposterous !
I will have nothing to do with it !
I can offer you no welcome , sir .
Had the matter been left in my hands , I would have turned you from the door .
Forgive me .
Darling , are you ill ?
- What is it ?
- What ?
What is it ?
My sweet , why are you suffering so ?
- Tell me what it is .
- Tell you ?
I 've come to tell you ...
I 've come to set you free .
- Set me free ?
- Yes .
What are you saying ?
If you ever loved me , tell me what 's wrong .
Everything 's wrong !
I no longer have any claim on you .
- But that 's for me to say .
- No .
My darling , I beg you to tell me .
What is it ?
No .
You don 't have to explain anything .
Whatever it is , I know you 've done nothing base or mean .
Please , my dear !
Please , angel of God ... don 't say anymore .
I set you free .
Darling , is that all you have to say to me ?
- Don 't you want me any longer ?
- Want you ?
I want you so that I can envy the damned .
- I am damned .
- You don 't know what you 're saying .
Do you think I 'd let you go ?
Only tell me that you love me , and I 'm yours .
Don 't keep anything from me , darling .
- I love you , and I 'll help you .
- My love .
My darling .
My beautiful ... if I could take you in my arms , if I could only touch you ...
Think of it .
I daren 't even touch you ever again ...
- in this world or the next .
- What are you hiding from me ?
Trust me .
Believe in me .
I 'll help you .
No .
I 'm beyond help , Muriel ! I 'm in hell !
- I must give you up !
- But I won 't let you !
- No .
- I 'll go with you wherever you say .
I 'll help you no matter what it is .
If I could only have you , I 'd give my soul ... but I have no soul !
I 'm beyond the pale !
- I 'm one of the living dead !
- I won 't let you go !
My poor , dear , suffering love , be quiet .
Rest .
Don 't say anymore .
Be quiet and rest .
- Let me go .
Let me go quickly .
- No .
I love you .
I won 't let you go .
I love you .
- Sweetheart .
- No !
I give you up because I love you so .
This is my proof .
This is my penance .
Do you hear , oh , God ?
Oh , God .
Don 't let me .
Save me !
Help me !
Father , help !
Help , Hobson !
Help , police !
You stay here .
I 'll go ahead !
This way , officer .
Stop him !
Stop him !
Help !
Police !
This is the weapon , Doctor .
I know whose cane this is .
I can take you to the man .
Break it down !
Come on , Bill .
Give it a shove .
- This one 's locked , too !
- Open in the name of the law !
Break it down !
- Where is he ?
- He 's run out there through the back door .
Come on !
- Don 't stand there staring , you fool !
- Yes , sir .
The door down there is locked on the outside .
Then go out through the front .
Come on , Scobie .
- You stay there .
- Wait !
- He has escaped , sir .
- Your man has not escaped .
There !
There he is !
There 's your man !
- But , Doctor , this is impossible .
- I know it is , but there 's your man !
- I 'm sorry , sir .
You appear to be serious ...
- Look !
- Come on !
- Hold him !
Come on !
Close that door !
- Close that door there !
- Don 't let him get away !
Look out !
- Steady , boy !
- Drop that knife !
Dr. Jekyll .
With times as tough as they are , we present a formula for cheap amusement :
Nightmares .
First you eat a real lobster - not the kind they send to Congress .
Then you add milk and mix in a horror story .
We 've all heard of the worm that turned , but this is the bookworm that turned - inside out .
If you can work up a chill , it helps .
A little tomain poisoning will get your mind off your other troubles .
When you get that feeling , a cross between delirium tremens and the seven-year itch , you know that something will come up any minute .
A good nightmare always begins in a dark cellar with a coffin .
A caretaker comes down to see that all the ghosts are locked up for the night .
He 'd better keep away from the casket or he 'll be coughing ' .
But he doesn 't care .
You can see how brave he is .
So he decides to ask the guy his name and how he feels .
Why , it 's Dracula , the guy who invented necking .
The caretaker decides to run out and have a good fit .
He 's afraid that Dracula may want a blood transfusion any minute , but when he tries to go away , he meets himself coming back .
It looks as though he 's having his ups and downs . He acts like Congress and always ends up where he started .
This exercise is good for water on the knee , water on the brain and other naval diseases .
It is also a good way of enjoying the jitters without drinking alcohol .
The poor fellow is afraid to go to bed , so he sleeps in a hammock .
Dracula wants to start his stuff .
He thinks he 's clever , but we see right through him .
So the caretaker comes downstairs with a hatchet .
I don 't know how he got upstairs , but anything can happen in a nightmare .
Dracula was a big cheese , so he always had mice around him .
So he hits Dracula in the coffin .
As usual , Dracula rises to the occasion .
Now he 's got Dracula sore , and the caretaker hasn 't a ghost of a show .
The caretaker decides he might have been seeing things .
Maybe his near beer was nearer than he thought .
No , sir , he was right .
A guy with a face like Dracula must be a spook , or he 'd have his face lifted .
And the worst of it is , this spook looks screwy .
There 's nothing screwier than a screwy spook .
He decides to retire .
If I were in his place , I 'd resign or at least quit .
As the door blows open , he gets the delicious aroma of fresh ghost .
He gets an attack of the pivot disease .
It 's like the hiccups - the more you do it , the more you have to .
When you think you 're over it , you 're just beginning .
The only way to stop is to do it faster and tire yourself out .
If you saw this sight in your bedroom , maybe you 'd have a jitter or two .
He 's got it again .
This is what 's known as being several sheets in the wind .
It 's becoming a habit .
Pretty soon he 'll wear out the sheet and he 'll have to start on the mattress .
Then he 'll get down to the rugs and they 'll need new furniture .
So Dracula comes up close and shows us what the well-dressed ghost is wearing .
He throws his silhouette on the wall , and the wall is so scared , it looks plastered .
And now the blood may spurt any minute .
Gush , gush .
There is the profile that has won first prize in all the ghost beauty contests .
When Dracula was born , his mother took one took at that face and had herself arrested .
So he decides to go back to his coffin and sleep for 100 years until Congress decides to do something about the Depression .
Well , well , what a nightmare .
Think of having Dracula and the monster from Frankenstein in the same dream .
He 's asleep , but maybe if we talk in his own language we can wake him .
You see , it 's very simple , if you know how to handle your monsters .
This looks dangerous .
Hey , Doctor , look out .
He 's awake .
Well , it 's too late .
It looks as if the doctor is going to need a doctor .
No , we were wrong .
The doctor 's going to need an undertaker .
The monster starts out to look for trouble .
There 's so much trouble these days , he shouldn 't have any trouble finding it .
He can 't decide which way to go .
He 's like a woman automobile driver .
Here 's Dracula .
When he and the monster get together , things should happen .
What do you think of that ?
He 's afraid of Dracula .
Which proves that a monster can dish it out , but he can 't take it .
Who 's this ?
Why , it 's Helen Twelvetrees .
Maybe the nightmare is going to become a pleasant dream .
No , we 're wrong .
The monster is still looking for trouble .
A man tells Helen she has no business being in the same nightmare as Dracula .
But Dracula 's nearby and the gentleman 's finish starts to begin to commence .
Meantime , the monster is looking on and studying Dracula 's technique .
Helen is beside herself , and now something else is beside her .
There 's nothing for Helen to do but faint and wait for the nightmare to be over .
Dracula 's income tax was due and he had to get some money .
When night came , Helen had decided to call it a day .
But she forgot to take her jewels off , and they look like ready money to Dracula .
He has to be careful .
Helen is very ticklish around the neck .
In fact , it 's a very ticklish situation .
And , of course , the monster is taking it all in .
But suddenly Dracula throws caution to the winds and his fingers to the windpipe .
Finally , the deed is did , and Helen awakes in her sleep .
When Helen tells the young man she saw a ghost , he says he 'd like to see one too .
Well , it 's too bad .
It looks as if his goose is cooked or his cook is hashed .
Dracula gets him and we hear the vampire eating his supper behind the wall .
It 's becoming tough .
Every time Helen talks to a man , Dracula gets him .
At this rate , she could never get married - she 'd be a widow every 15 minutes .
Dracula has finished his entrée and is coming back for the dessert .
The monster is still around and he 's getting a lot of bad ideas .
There comes Dracula in disguise , but we 'd know him anywhere .
You can always recognise him by the fourth toe on his left foot .
The monster thinks chasing women is a lot of fun .
In fact , he decides to try it himself .
And here 's little Mae Clarke .
She 's going to be married and , as you see , she 's jumping with joy .
In the background is the monster , ready to try out Dracula 's technique .
If Mae had eyes in the back of her head , she 'd faint .
Hey , Mae .
It 's ...
So she starts to run with the monster behind .
They start to play follow-the-leader , then it becomes ring-around-the-rosey .
Mae is so scared , she 's running around in circles .
If her fiancé sees her , he 'll think she 's nutty .
She finally tells the monster she can 't play anymore because she 's got to be married .
The poor monster is broken-hearted because nobody 's afraid of him .
He has to sit down all day , because when he stands up his feet touch the floor .
But finally he sees what he wants and decides to go after it .
What can it be ?
Maybe it 's Dracula .
Whatever it is , he wants it .
Why , it 's our lobster-and-milk friend , and look where he is .
He 'd better look out , or the monster will get him .
It 's a good thing he 's waking up , or he might fall and break his chandelier .
And the moral of this story is :
You can milk a cow , but a lobster is very ticklish .
THE BLUE LIGHT
Good day Mister .
Greetings .
Can we stay here tonight ? .
Tomorrow we would like to go to Monte Christallo .
Who is this person Junta ? .
Junta ? .
Ernst , come in .
Bring the book here , it is about Junta .
Horst , it is now the right time to read about the Blue Light on the mountain .
Did Junta really live ? .
Have we arrived ? .
Does this road lead to Santa Maria ? .
Hey Sir ...
Is he mute or doesn 't he understand German ? .
Bye ... . bye ...
I am the hotel manager of Santa Maria .
Oh thank God ... finally somebody who speaks German .
Did you come to pick me up ? .
Yes .
What are these strange sculptures ? .
These are the boys of the village who fell off the mountain .
That 's my son .
You are not very joyful here .
It 's a full moon , a bad day for Santa Maria .
What does that have to do with the moon ? .
A curse on our village since the big flow that came down from the Monte Christallo .
When it is full moon , there is a blue light shining on the rock .
Each time the young boys want to go up and each time ... and each time one cross more .
I planted a cross for my youngest son .
Tonio ! .
Tonio ! .
Why are you so against that girl ? .
She is not normal
How can she climb towards the blue light ... on the steep side of the mountain ... while the young boys fall down every time ? .
This Junta , she 's the damned devil 's witch .
Do not close the shutters , it 's such nice weather
It 's a full moon .
Ah yes , the blue light ...
My son ... six months ago ... he was the fourth victim this year ...
Silvio ! .
Silvio !
... .
Silvio ! .
There she is , the devil 's witch .
Damm you !
It 's all her fault , it 's her fault .
Stop !
Guzzi !
Guzzi !
Guzzi !
Guzzi !
Guzzi ...
Guzzi !
Junta !
I 'm here ... I 'm here .
Hey ... what 's the matter ? .
have some ... eat .
I was on the street , early this morning All of a sudden I saw a crowd in front of Maria 's house
I heard Maria , who shouted : " " Junta , Junta ! " .
I was afraid and ran away ... then I saw the threatening crowd .
They ran after me with sticks ... they threatened me with their fists and they shouted : " " Aaaa ... aaaaa ... "
They threw stones at me ... I was running but they came nearer and nearer ...
Then a man jumped from a window ... he stood there with his arm like this and shouted : " " Stop ! " .
Junta , where are you ? .
Junta ...
Junta ...
Junta !
Junta !
Hi ! Ah ...
Hello ...
What do you have there ? .
Is that milk ? .
Hey ...
It 's very nice here .
I 'd like to stay here ...
Now I must go .
I want to leave here before it gets dark ... but I will come again .
Tomorrow , I will come again
For sure .
So ...
See you again .
Junta
See you again .
I wanted to say something
Tomorrow , I 'll go back to the mountains .
I might stay over there for a few days ... so do not get worried .
Junta !
Junta ...
Junta !
Good day Sir .
So Junta , here I am again .
And this is a small contribution for our life in common .
This is bread .
Bread .
I know .
Cheese .
How nice , how nice ...
But where shall I sleep ? .
I guess you sleep there ... and the little boy over there ...
And me ? .
Sleeping ? .
To sleep ? .
To sleep !
Ah ... I understand , I understand .
But where ? .
There ... you can sleep here .
You ' ll sleep very well .
Junta , little witch ...
you make me behave like a fool ...
If only we could speak with each other it would be perfect .
I have been here for many weeks now and ... I 'll not go back ever ... back to the people ... .
Ju nta ... Ju nta ... what 's happen ing with you ?
.
Junta ... little Junta ...
What ? .
Junta ... Junta ... what 's happening with you ?
Come and show me what you brought from the village .
Let 's have a look .
Junta ...
Junta ...
Junta ... my little Junta ...
How can I explain it to you ... you cannot understand me ...
What 's the matter ? .
Those crystals ... they are a danger for you ... and for the whole village .
But they could be a blessing .
The peasants should be told about it .
Let me go now
Don 't go .
Stay .
Stay with me .
It 's a real treasure ... it must be found ... and brought to the village .
You 'll never have to run around in these rag clothes anymore .
I 'll come back .
Very soon
I 'll come back .
See you !
It 's not here ... that you should climb
But here , at this side ... till those rocks .
And then , do not climb there , but here , and you will find the entrance to the grotto .
We understand .
Goodnight .
Junta .
Junta !
Junta !
That 's how the poor Junta of Santa Maria died
But her memory lives on in the village , the people who persecuted her so much they got rich with the stones of the Monte Christallo .
End of the story of Junta
Hey , you guys , wait a minute .
How far is it to the next town ?
- Only 10 miles .
- Then it 's no use , boys .
I 'm through .
Just cover me with leaves and tell my mother I died with her name on my lips .
Time out while we watch Joe die .
Is anyone around here human enough to give me a cigarette ?
Here you are .
And you 're the guy who said this was going to be a pleasure trip .
- It 's part of your education .
- Yeah ?
You can 't leave Germany without taking a walking trip .
Why can 't I ?
Oh , look !
What 's that ?
As I live and breathe , a taxicab in the middle of the Black Forest .
Hey , brother , can you give us a lift into town ?
We 've been hiking all day and we 're tired . Tired .
What did he say ?
He says he 's engaged for the whole afternoon .
That settles it .
He just wants to bargain . Come on .
We 'll pay you well .
We 're Americans .
- What did he say ? - He says he 's a man of honour .
- Theatre ?
Actresses ? - Actresses ?
Are they young ?
Ask him quickly , for heaven 's sakes , how many of them are there ? Six .
One , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
Did you say you were sailing in three weeks ?
I 've cancelled my reservations .
- Three , four , five , six ...
- Get out !
- Sit down !
- I wasn 't ...
They seem disturbed about something .
- Do you suppose we 're not welcome ? - Are there six or are there seven ?
I 'm sorry , Miss , but I don 't understand a word .
- Will you please go away ?
- You speak English .
Really quite a surprise .
Have you just come from America ?
- Rather a long swim , isn 't it ?
- Will you go away ?
What a charming country this is .
I 've half a mind to settle here for good .
Would you mind telling me how long this is going to keep up ?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Now that you call my attention to it , I guess I am .
Please .
We have to be back in the theatre by 6 : 00 .
Otherwise , we 'll all lose our positions .
We wouldn 't dream of being the cause of that .
But if we go ... will you and your friends meet us for something to eat after the show tonight ?
We 'll do nothing of the kind .
All right then , my little water nymph , we 'll stay .
I think you are the most impossible person I 've ever met !
Look , Mummy , I 'm a crocodile .
Got it .
Missed it .
Got it .
Missed it .
- Look , Mummy , I 'm a fish .
- Excuse me , I thought you were a boat .
No , I 've changed now .
I 'm a fish .
Sit up , Johnny .
You know I have no time to play . Father will be back soon .
- Sit down .
- Thank you , Doctor .
Well , young man , what seems to be your trouble ?
Dr. Pierce , I have a rather peculiar request to make .
I want to sell you my body .
Why do you particularly want to sell it to me ?
Well , sir , in view of your reputation on this side of the water ... I had an idea that my body in its present condition ... might be very interesting to you .
Before as well as after death .
- What 's the matter with you ?
- I 've been poisoned by radium emanations .
- What is your occupation ?
- I 'm a commercial chemist .
I 've been working on a process whereby the various radium products ... can be utilised without danger .
How long have you been working on this thing ?
- Ten or twelve years .
- That 's a very valuable idea .
Who made your diagnosis ?
I know enough about the symptoms to do it myself .
- Have you had any blood tests lately ?
- Three weeks ago and again last night .
I think I 'm good for another eight months , a year at the most .
I wish I could help you , but I 'm afraid I can 't .
Do you know anybody else who might be interested in my condition ?
Look here , Doctor , I need money very badly .
Why , are you married ?
I wouldn 't have come here if I weren 't .
- Any children ?
- Yes , a little boy .
- Does your wife know about your condition ?
- She does .
I told her last night .
Come to think of it , I 've just heard from a friend of mine in Germany .
There 's a specialist there named ...
What was that name ?
Holzapfel .
- Been pretty successful in cases like yours .
- Holzapfel ?
At Dresden ?
- Yes .
Do you know him ?
- Do I know him ?
He was one of my professors when I was studying over there .
He was , was he ?
Doctor , how much do you think it would cost ?
Well , the cure is said to take three or four months .
I should say about $ 1,500 .
$ 1,500 ?
- That 's a lot of money , isn 't it ?
- It certainly is .
- Aren 't you working ?
- Only at odd jobs , one or two days a week .
Let 's see .
I could let you have , say , $ 50 .
No , Doctor , thank you .
Thank you so much for your patience .
Glad you came to see me .
Bedtime , Johnny .
Daddy , can 't I just stay up 10 minutes longer ?
No .
- Five ?
- No .
- Two ?
- No .
Alley-oop .
Wait a minute , Mummy .
Right in the bull 's eye , Johnny .
- Which one are you going to tell me ?
- Which one do you want to hear ?
- The one about Germany .
- But you 've heard that one so often .
- I want to hear it again . - Ned .
Coming .
- All set , Daddy ? - You bet .
Go on , Mummy .
It was springtime in Germany ...
It was springtime in Germany , and it was warm .
I had spring fever and the air was full of blossoms .
Now it 's your turn .
Let 's see .
I was out with some other students on a walking trip ... and pretty soon we came to a dragon sitting in an automobile ... who told us there was a magic pool in the forest .
- And what did you do ?
- We went to the pool , of course .
- And what do you suppose we saw ?
- What ?
Imagine !
Half a dozen princesses taking a bath .
- And what did you do when you saw him ?
- I told him to go away .
- And did he ?
- He did not .
And what happened then ?
The most beautiful princess of all ... said that if I 'd go away , she 'd grant me my wish .
- And what did you wish ?
- I wished to see her again .
I couldn 't think of anything better to wish .
So that night I went to a theatre , and music began to play .
And out upon the stage stepped this princess ... and she looked more beautiful than ever .
She was beautiful !
And then your heart began to go like this ?
And Mummy began to sing ?
And my heart stopped beating entirely .
What happened to you when you saw him ?
I could hardly sing , and I could barely wait until I saw him again .
But you did see him again , didn 't you ?
I met him later that night .
- What happened then ?
- You can never guess .
- We went walking .
- Go on , walk .
Okay , skipper .
And then we came to a park .
Only there was a tremendously large yellow moon up in the sky .
It was altogether too big and too bright .
But it was dark under the trees , very dark .
This is a tree , Johnny .
- And what happened under the tree ?
- Then he kissed me .
- And what happened after that ?
- He kissed me again .
And what happened then ?
Then we were married .
And then ?
And then we started to think about you ...
Get out of here .
Would you need that $ 1,500 all at once ?
No , but if I had $ 300, I could at least get to Germany .
I haven 't yet figured out a way of paying the rent ... unless I part with the microscope .
So I 'm afraid we 'll have to postpone our trip abroad this year .
I could earn that money by going back to the stage .
I won 't have you do that .
But the doctor says you must go away .
If I worked a few weeks , I might make enough for your passage .
And then we 'll find a way to keep you over there ... until you get well .
It 's out of the question .
I won 't have you go back to the stage .
- Ned ?
- What is it ?
I was going back to my old work anyway .
- Will it make you happy ?
- It isn 't that .
We need money .
It 's only a question of weeks .
My formula is almost completed ...
- and then we 'll have all the money we need .
- I know , dear .
But in the meantime , I 'm going to do something to give you a chance to get well .
AGENT : Have you come to be placed ?
HELEN : Yes .
- What 's your name ?
- Faraday .
- What 's that ?
- Helen Faraday .
- Got an appointment ?
- No , I haven 't .
You 'll have to wait , all these people are ahead of you .
Thank you , honey .
I 'll see you later .
Going to lunch , Sally , be back in 10 minutes .
MAN :
Morning , Mr. Smith .
You remember me ?
WOMAN : What about the job you said you had for me ? SMITH :
Just a minute , folks .
Just a minute ...
JIM : You remember my dramatic sketch , Mr. Smith ?
SMITH : Just a minute , Jim .
You 're waiting to see me , aren 't you ?
Run along , Eddy , I 'll see you later .
Come on in , baby .
[ Voices rise in protest ] WOMAN : I beg your pardon , we 've been here a long time !
SMITH : You 'll be here a long time after she 's gone .
Sit down , take a load off your feet .
- When was the last time you worked ?
- Five or six years ago .
- Where ?
- Germany .
- Can you put over a song ? - I used to be able to .
- How much will you take ?
- Anything I can get .
It doesn 't matter .
Don 't tell me you 're working just for the love of your art .
- Who 's your boyfriend ?
- I haven 't any .
- Will you work for $ 25 a week ?
- Yes .
Well , you 're in luck , baby .
You came to the right man .
I guess , maybe I can get you $ 30 or $ 40 .
I might be able to raise it to $ 50 .
That includes commission , of course .
I generally get 20 % , but seeing it 's you , I 'll make it 15 .
- Is that okay ?
- Yes .
You know that ain 't a high commission ... considering the personal service I give my clientele .
Why , the minute you put yourself in my hands , baby ... your interests are closer to me than my own . Get me ?
Get up and walk around a bit .
Let 's see what you got .
- What I 've got ?
- Let 's see your legs .
- Is that enough ?
- For the time being .
- What did you say your name was ?
- Helen Faraday .
No , we got to get something different .
Something unusual .
Something that 's easy to say and hard to forget .
Jones .
I got it .
Helen Jones .
But my name isn 't Jones .
What of it ?
My name ain 't Smith either , but I get by just the same , don 't I ?
Hello .
Tell her I 'm out to lunch .
Hey , wait a minute .
Call up O 'Connor 's and tell him I 'm bringing him a pip .
You 've certainly got me all hopped up , baby .
Yup , you certainly got me hopped up .
So , this is the pip you phoned about .
Where did you pick her up ?
I ran across her a long time ago . I 've been saving her for a spot like this .
- Can she croon ?
What I need 's a crooner .
- She can croon in a pinch .
Who can 't ?
I got one good-looker eating her head off on me already .
- I don 't know if I can use another .
- All right , then .
All right .
I got three or four spots I can place this dame without half trying .
Come on , baby .
Wait a minute .
What 's your hurry ?
I didn 't say I wouldn 't give her a tryout , did I ?
All right .
And if she makes good , it 's $ 40 a week and her grub the first week .
$ 50 the next , and $ 75 if she stays on .
And you take out my 15 % every Saturday night .
- I was figuring on starting her at $ 30 .
- $ 30 ? I don 't handle no $ 30 junks . Scram .
All right .
All right .
Keep your shirt on .
- What did you say your name was ? - Jones .
Well , we 'll change that .
Come on , I 'll show you your dressing room .
What time is it ?
A little after 6 : 00 .
What 's all the rush ? You said you weren 't on till 10 : 00 .
Yes I know , but I have to rehearse again .
Johnny , darling , I forgot my hairbrush .
It 's on my dresser .
Good heavens , where is my music ?
- This it ?
- Here you are , Mummy .
Thank you , Johnny . Yes , thank you .
Johnny is to have his soup , carrots , toast , a glass of milk , and a pudding .
And don 't let him stay up late .
Here you are , Mummy .
- What 's that for ?
- Good luck .
Thank you , Johnny .
I need it .
- Goodbye , Ned .
- Goodbye , Helen .
I hate to see you do this .
Don 't , Ned .
Don 't make it too difficult .
Good night , Ned .
Good night , Johnny .
Good night , Helen .
What time will you be back ?
It might be late , better not sit up for me .
Good night .
- Bye , Mummy .
- Goodbye , Johnny .
Come on , Johnny , we better have our dinner now .
Gee whiz , are we going to have dinner on our own every night ?
I don 't know , Johnny .
So you 're the Blonde Venus ?
Don 't tell me you thought of that label all by yourself .
No , Mr. O 'Connor told me it would help me in my work .
He would .
He didn 't have to think up any name for me ... when I helped put this dump on the map .
My name 's " Taxi Belle " Hooper .
Taxi for short .
Do you charge for the first mile ?
Say , you trying to ride me ?
Don 't get the wrong idea .
They call me Taxi ... because I won 't ride in nothing else .
Safety first , that 's my motto .
Good drinking partners always make bad drivers .
" Do I charge for the first mile ? "
- Hello , Taxi .
- Hello .
How are you getting along , Miss Jones ?
Almost ready ?
Almost , thank you .
That " Blonde Venus " gag of mine did the trick .
The house is packed .
I 'll have my hands full tonight .
- Why were you late again ?
Run out of gas ?
- Don 't crab , I couldn 't help it .
- Nick just came in .
- Why tell me ?
You 're not pulling any wool over my eyes .
I 'm sick and tired of this joint .
O 'Connor would jump all over me if it wasn 't for Nick .
Look what he gave me the other night .
- Who , O 'Connor ?
- No , that tightwad wouldn 't give you ... the sleeves out of his vest .
This bracelet is a present from Nick Townsend .
You 've heard of him .
The politician , loads of jack .
Runs this end of town .
I can hock it any day I like for $ 1500 .
- $ 1500 ?
- Yeah , maybe I can get more .
I did him a little favour once and this is how he came through .
I wish he 'd ask me for some other favours , if you know what I mean .
I told you once before my name wasn 't Georgy .
- And it ain 't Oscar either .
- All right , Rudolph , have it your own way .
Are you going to get up , or are you going to take it sitting down ?
Why don 't you go back to your table and behave yourself ?
- Come on , guy .
- O 'Connor , leave him alone .
I 'll manage him .
Now look , why don 't you cool down and run along ?
We don 't want any trouble .
- Yellow , huh ?
- Yes , maybe I am .
As a matter of fact , I 'm scared stiff .
And being reasonably certain that someone 's going to get a punch in the jaw ... I 'm going to make sure it isn 't me . [ Woman screams ]
Are you going back for more , or will we go home , you big stiff ?
WOMAN : Come on , Mary .
MAN : Who hit me ?
Sorry this happened , Mr. Townsend .
That 's all right , O 'Connor .
I rather enjoyed it .
All right , Jimmie , let 's go .
Trot ' em out .
Say , I wish you 'd quit picking on these fellows .
I 've filled every hospital in town for you now .
All right , boss , I 'll do my best , but I can 't help it if these birds get my goat .
- Say , look out where you 're going .
- What a fine evening this turned out to be .
All right now , Monsieur . Table number 14 for this party .
Say , Charlie , is that gorilla real ?
Say , lady , if that animal was real ... I wouldn 't be here .
Here you are , Miss Hooper .
It 's all ready for you .
How 's the show going , Charlie ?
I think it 's going to be pretty good .
Yeah ?
- Hello , Nick , darling .
- Sit down , Taxi .
- Do you mind ?
- No , go right ahead .
[ Singing ] Did you ever happen to hear a voodoo ?
Hear it and you won 't give a darn what you do
Tom-toms put me under a sort of hoodoo
And the whole night long I don 't know the right from wrong
Hot voodoo , black as mud Hot voodoo , in my blood
That African tempo
Has made me a slave
Hot voodoo , dance of sin Hot voodoo , worse than gin
I 'd follow a caveman
Right into his cave
That beat gives me a wicked sensation
My conscience wants to take a vacation
Got voodoo , head to toes Hot voodoo , burn my clothes
I want to start dancing Just wearing a smile
Hot voodoo , I 'm aflame I 'm really not to blame
That African tempo is meaner than mean
Hot voodoo makes me brave I want to misbehave
I 'm beginning to feel like an African queen
Those drums bring out The devil inside me
I need some great big angel to guide me
Hot voodoo gets me wild Oh , fireman , save this child
I 'm going to blazes
I want to be bad
- Not bad , eh , Henry ?
- I should say not .
- Where 'd you dig her up , O 'Connor ?
- How do you like her , boys ?
- Pretty good .
- Say , O 'Connor , I 'd like to meet her .
- You would ?
- You can fix it up , can 't you ?
I don 't know whether I can or not .
Why don 't you go backstage and find out for yourself ?
If you don 't think he will , you 're crazy .
- Mind if I go along , too , Charlie ?
- I knew you 'd horn in .
- You don 't mind if I come along ?
- What if I did ? NICK : Be back in a minute , Taxi .
All right , boys . Come in .
This is my good friend , Mr. Nick Townsend .
Miss Jones .
- How do you do , Miss Jones ?
- Mr. Townsend .
- Mr. Henry Johnson .
- Miss Jones .
- How do you do , Miss Jones ?
- Mr. Johnson .
- Say , Charlie , what 's your last name ?
- Blaine .
- Pleased to meet you , Miss Jones .
- Thank you , Mr. Blaine .
- Sit down , gentlemen .
- How about ordering something to drink ?
BLAINE : What 'll you have , Miss Jones ?
I don 't drink .
- Smoke ?
- No , thank you .
- You won 't last very long in this place .
- Why won 't she ?
- She 's got too much class for this joint .
- She has ?
Beat it , Charlie .
I knew that was coming .
Good night , Miss Jones .
See you later , O 'Connor .
- Blaine is the name .
- I got you .
Good night , Henry .
I see .
- Good night , Miss Jones . - Good night .
- You can run along , too , if you like .
- I was just going out anyway .
You 've got about 20 minutes before your next number , baby .
You 're quite at home here , aren 't you , Mr. Townsend ?
I don 't know .
I 'm not exactly a stranger here .
Flowers for you , Miss Jones .
Wait a minute .
Here we are .
Thank you , sir .
Are these from you ?
Were you expecting them from anyone else ?
You embarrass me , Mr. Townsend .
You better go now . I have to dress .
What are we going to do about tonight ?
Shall I wait for you after the show ?
I don 't know .
I think I 'd rather go home alone .
- Honestly , you 'd do me a great favour .
- A great favour ?
Yes , a great favour .
Will I get a bracelet for it ?
- Has Taxi been talking about me ?
- She said some very nice things about you .
Well , now , don 't get the wrong idea .
Taxi really did me a favour and only a favour .
And there 's nothing more between us than just that ... although she 'd like to give people the impression that there is .
How am I to believe that , Mr. Townsend ?
I 'll give you a bracelet .
There 's nothing between us , is there ?
I don 't accept bracelets from a stranger .
There 's no reason why we should remain strangers .
This kid certainly looks like you .
I was waiting up for you .
I guess I fell asleep .
What time is it ?
Late enough .
You 'd better go to bed and get some sleep .
I need some too .
We have a big day ahead of us .
We must buy tickets and pack and get you off quickly .
Tickets ?
Pack ?
Why , don 't tell me ...
You can 't have got the money already .
The manager gave me an advance .
Don 't ask me more now .
I 'm too tired .
Of course , I forgot .
You must be tired .
Tell me , Ned , do you love me ?
Helen , what 's wrong ?
Do I love you ?
You silly little thing .
What a question .
Promise me to get well and come back to me .
Of course I 'll come back .
I wish I didn 't have to go away .
I wish I could spend every moment of my life with you .
Do I love you ?
You poor little thing .
- Goodbye , Ned .
- Goodbye , darling .
It 's only for six months .
- Come back strong and well .
- Of course I will .
- Say goodbye to Daddy , darling .
- Goodbye , Daddy .
- Take good care of Mummy , Johnny . - I will , Daddy .
Goodbye .
- Goodbye , Ned .
- Goodbye .
Goodbye , Daddy .
Goodbye , Ned .
Goodbye , Helen .
Goodbye , Johnny .
You better learn to write , Johnny , so you can send me some letters .
- Mummy ?
- What is it , Johnny ?
- Has Daddy gone away for good ?
- No , dear , he 'll be back soon .
I want him to come back soon .
- Hello , Helen .
- I wish you hadn 't come here .
I 'm sorry , Helen .
I figured you 'd need cheering up .
This is Mr. Townsend , Johnny .
- How do you do , Johnny ?
- Hello , Mr. Townsend .
- Can I take you home ?
- You shouldn 't have come here .
Give me that dog , will you , Tom ?
- Isn 't he a beauty , Johnny ?
- For me ?
When I was your age , I 'd have given my right leg for one of those .
- Can I keep him , Mummy ?
- Yes , Johnny .
Come along , let me take you home .
You 'd have to take a taxi , anyway .
I 'm no magician .
I can 't pick her out of the air .
- I 've done my best to find her .
- Did you try her home ?
Sure .
I tried her home and I found out plenty .
She 's married .
- Married ?
- And what 's more , she 's got a kid .
- And her husband 's gone to Europe ... for his health . - A kid ?
- For his health ?
- He sailed three weeks ago .
She ain 't been home all day and neither has the kid ... and nobody knows when she 'll be back .
Maybe something 's happened to them .
And me picking a winner for the first time this year .
Blooie goes my 15 % .
Why , the next one I get I 'll nail down , if I have to marry her .
What 's the idea of sending for me in a rush ?
Hello , Taxi .
How are you , darling ?
- What 's wrong ?
- There 's nothing wrong .
I got a swell new number all lined up for you .
I want you to start rehearsing it this afternoon .
Yeah .
There 's a catch in this somewhere .
Hello .
O 'Connor , I meant to call you up yesterday , but I didn 't get around to it .
Miss Jones isn 't going to work for you anymore .
What 's the idea ?
She can 't quit me like this .
- Who 's that ?
- Nick Townsend .
After me giving her all this publicity and working up a swell following for her .
Do you happen to have a contract with Miss Jones ?
- Do you have that dame under contract ?
- Have I got a million dollars ?
I don 't need no contract with my artists .
My word 's as good as my bond ... and I stand to lose a lot of dough if she don 't show up .
You ought to see the drop in my business the last two days she hasn 't been here .
I 'll talk to you about that later .
Meantime , you just forget about Miss Jones .
O 'Connor 's isn 't a fit place for you to be seen in night after night .
Besides , you got Johnny to look after now .
Who 's going to take care of him if you keep on working ?
You can 't make enough money there anyway to send to your husband ... unless you meet another sucker like me .
And there 's another thing I want you to do .
A friend of mine has left town and his apartment is empty .
I suggest that you and Johnny spend the summer there .
It 'll do both of you a lot of good .
What do you expect for all of this ?
Nothing .
I like you , that 's all .
And I think you 've got a swell kid .
And I 'm trying to help you both out of a tight spot .
There 's no use trying to fool myself , or you , Helen .
I 'm crazy about you , and I want you to like me , too , if you can .
You 're making it difficult for me not to .
Come on , honey , give me a little kiss , will you ? Just a little one ?
- How are you , Mrs. Weiss ?
- I 'm fine , Mrs. Collins .
How are you ?
- I 'm all right .
It 's a fine day .
- Yeah , it 's a fine day .
- Have you seen Mrs. Faraday ?
- No , I didn 't see Mrs. Faraday .
- Was she here again ?
- Yes , she was here again .
- She 's living now with her sister , you know ?
- Her sister ? - I thought it was her aunt .
- Maybe you are right .
Maybe it was her aunt .
- Or maybe it was her uncle .
- Yeah , maybe it was her grandmother .
- Anything the matter ?
- He 's coming back .
- When ?
- In about a month .
- Completely cured ?
- Yes , he 's well now .
- What are you going to do ?
- Go back to him .
- Do you want to ?
- He 's my husband .
- I see .
You going to tell him about me ?
- No .
- Do you still love him ?
- He needs me .
- So do I , Helen .
- Not the way he does .
You 're strong , Nick .
He 's not .
JOHNNY : Did Peter Pan have wings ?
MARY :
No . - Did he have an aeroplane ?
- No .
Well , then how 'd he fly ?
We 're going for a walk , Mrs. Faraday .
- Goodbye , Mummy .
- Goodbye , sweetheart .
Have a nice walk .
- Hello , Johnny .
- Hello , Mr. Townsend .
- Don 't stay out too late , Mary . - No , ma 'am , I won 't .
When do I say goodbye to you and the kid ?
I kind of wish now I 'd never met you .
No , I take that back .
A little of you is worth a lifetime with any other woman .
Let 's end this thing right , Helen .
Can we end it right ?
Let 's go away for a couple of weeks together , just you and I.
I don 't understand .
Haven 't you seen her ? Doesn 't she come here at all ?
Sure I have .
She generally comes around here ... two or three times a week for her letters .
But this time , I haven 't seen her for 10 days .
Two weeks , Mr. Faraday .
- Ten days .
- Two weeks .
If you don 't shut up , I 'll give you a bust in the mouth .
Two weeks , Mr. Faraday .
Go on , sweep the cellar .
- We have to go back today , don 't we ? - Yes .
There 's a boat leaving for Europe tomorrow morning .
I can 't stay in the same city with you without seeing you .
- How long will you be gone ?
- I don 't know .
A year , a couple of years .
Till I forget you .
I wish I were someone else .
Then I could stay here with you forever .
So do I , Helen , not only for my sake , but for your own .
- There 's trouble ahead of you .
- I know it .
She worked here for three weeks and then she quit .
I ain 't seen or heard of her since .
In this business , they come and they go .
But she wrote me you put her under contract .
Raised her salary to $ 150 a week .
- She did ?
- Now I know where I 've seen you .
You 're the guy whose picture Venus had on her dressing table .
- Do you know where she is ?
- No , I don 't know .
- But you ask a guy named Nick Townsend ...
- Shut up , if you know what 's good for you .
Don 't mind her .
She 's cracked .
Wish I could help you locate your dame , brother .
But I don 't know a thing .
In this business , they come and they go .
- Helen .
- Ned .
Where 's Johnny ?
Where 've you been ?
What 's happened ?
It 's been awful coming here , finding you gone , not knowing where to look for you .
Your letter said you were staying another month .
But I cabled you a week ago .
Where have you been ?
Where 's Johnny ?
I 'm crazy to see him .
I 'll bring him as fast as I can . We didn 't know you were here .
Where is Johnny ?
You haven 't lived here for months .
What 's happened ?
If someone were to say I 'd been untrue to you , would you believe it ?
What do you mean " untrue " ?
I had planned to lie about it .
The money you needed , I didn 't get it the way I told you .
- A man gave it to me .
- Is his name Townsend ?
It doesn 't matter .
So when you told me the manager had given you an advance and raised your salary ...
It was a lie .
Why did you do it ?
How else could I have obtained money so quickly ?
I ought to be grateful to you , I suppose .
How much do I owe you and him for my life ?
Ned .
How much , beside the $ 1,500 I 've gotten from you ?
How much ? That 's all .
I 'll see that you get it back .
That 's simple enough , isn 't it ?
Yes .
Well , what next ?
I 'm here , if you 'll have me .
Go on as before ?
You saved my life , and I 'm very happy .
Let us go and thank this gentleman for his kindness to us .
Or would you rather I shoot him dead ?
It doesn 't matter .
He 's not to blame .
The minute I was out of sight ... you took up with the first man who could give you the things I couldn 't .
What puzzles me now is why you should want to come back to me .
- I love you , Ned .
- Send Johnny back here and clear out . Go on .
What are you waiting for ?
Are you going to take Johnny away from me ?
You 've been a rotten mother to him .
You 're through with him .
The law will give him to me if you don 't .
If you and your friend try to put up a fight for him ... I 'll take the case to court .
And you 'll find out soon enough who 's entitled to the custody of the child .
I 've been a good mother to Johnny .
Let 's not dispute that point , Helen .
Johnny 's all I 've got left .
Bring him here , or tell me where he is and I 'll get him myself .
No , I 'll bring him here .
- Baltimore car , please ?
- Baltimore car , next car , 118 .
What can I do for you ?
I want the police to help find my wife and child .
They 've been missing two days .
See Capt. Riley , room 68 , down the hall , third door on your right .
Isn 't this your picture , Mummy ?
- Why did you do that ?
- It was such a bad picture .
I thought it was pretty good .
Where 's my hat , Johnny ?
Now , don 't forget to lock the door .
I 'll only be a few minutes , and then we 'll go home and get some sleep .
I 'll lock the door , Mummy .
Finish your orange juice .
How about a kiss ?
[ Singing ] It isn 't often that I want a man
But when I do It 's just too bad
I know you 're acting hard to get
And yet I 've got a feeling you can be had
You so-and-so
You little so-and-so
Look what you 've done to me
You 're almost twice as bad as whosis again
I ought to take you out And how have you been ?
You this-and-that
You 've got me you know what
Is that the way to be ?
The Greeks have words for almost everything I know
But you little so-and-so
You so-and-so
You little so-and-so
How did you get this way ?
Although you know that I have lost my control
You sit and talk about my beautiful soul
You this-and-that
You 've got me you know what
Is that the way to be ?
The Greeks have words for almost everything I know
But you little so-and-so
Mr. Faraday ?
This is Police Headquarters .
We 've got a report on your wife .
She 's singing at the Star Cafe in Baltimore .
She and the child are staying at the Brittany Hotel .
Do you want us to have her arrested ?
No , I 'm going after her myself .
She checked out about 8 : 00 this morning , didn 't leave a forwarding address .
If you 're talking about Mrs. Blake , I heard her phoning about trains to Norfolk .
Norfolk ?
Can I have a timetable , please ?
Front .
- Get this gentleman a local timetable .
- Yes , sir .
Key for 515 , please .
- Thank you .
- You 're welcome , sir .
Please send a maid to 151 .
162 .
No , 151 .
- 175 .
- Johnny !
No , it 's definitely 151 .
- 198 .
- Yes .
- Hope they never find us . - You bad boy .
- F.
- F.
- A.
- A.
- T.
- T.
- H.
- H.
- E.
- E.
- R.
- R. - Father .
- Father .
Now , fill the whole page with it .
- Did you call me , ma 'am ?
- Come in . - What 's your name ?
- Viola .
- Viola ?
- Yes , ma 'am .
Johnny , this is Viola .
Viola , this is Johnny .
- How do you do , Johnny ?
- Hello , Viola .
Viola is going to stay with you until I come back .
There you are .
You better not try to get a job in this town , young lady ... if you want to keep out of sight .
I 've had that circular for two days .
And there was a man here an hour ago that I think was your husband .
My husband !
Whoever he is , I 've got the feeling he doesn 't like you very much .
And if I were you , I 'd keep away from cabarets altogether .
Please don 't tell anyone I was here .
Don 't worry .
I 've got a kid of my own . Good luck .
85 cents .
- Is that a lot of money ?
- No .
I 'm going to pay it right now .
I 'm afraid I can 't pay this .
- Why not ?
- I haven 't any money .
What 'd you do , forget your purse ?
My little boy was hungry .
We had to eat somewhere .
What do you think this is , a free soup kitchen ?
This is the third time today I 've been gypped out of a meal .
And , by golly , I won 't stand for any more of it .
I 'm going to call up the police .
Don 't call the police .
I 'll wash dishes , clean up , anything .
You going to wash my dishes ?
Go back and see the cook .
Come on , Johnny .
I 'm going to show you a nice , big kitchen .
Won 't that be fun ?
- Can I take my sucker along ?
- Of course you can .
Vagrancy , Your Honour .
Charged with vagrancy ?
Guilty or not guilty ?
Not guilty .
Not guilty ?
Is this your first offence ?
Yes , sir .
$ 30 or 30 days .
I can 't pay the fine .
Please don 't send me to jail .
I have a boy , 5 years old .
Where is he ?
At the Plantation Hotel .
Who 's with him ?
He 's alone .
I left him asleep .
A woman who leads the sort of life you do has no right to the custody of a minor child .
I do the best I can .
I haven 't been able to find work in days .
I suspend sentence on condition that you leave the city within 24 hours .
JUDGE : Take her out .
BAILIFF : Come on , beat it .
That dame looked like the Venus woman .
Take a look .
I don 't see any resemblance .
She 's got a kid , too .
I 've got a hunch . I 'm going to follow her .
Wake up , Johnny .
Where we going , Mummy ?
Help me , Johnny .
- There 's that man out there again .
- What man ? Just a white man that 's been snooping up and down the street ... for the last couple of days .
- Where is he ?
- That 's him .
I meant to tell you about him last night , but I guess it slipped my mind .
Try and find out what he wants , Cora .
Yes , ma 'am .
I 'll find out right away .
- Are they after us again ? - I don 't know , Johnny .
Howdy , boss .
- Hello , auntie .
- Looking for somebody ?
No , nobody in particular .
Why ? I knows everybody in the street and thought maybe I might be able to help you out .
No , I wasn 't looking for anybody .
Just browsing around .
Thanks just the same .
Just browsing around .
Yes , boss , I can see that .
Just browsing around .
What did he say , Cora ?
He says he ain 't lookin ' for nobody , he 's just browsin ' around .
But he can 't fool me , no sir .
That white man 's up to something .
I know when a white man 's browsing and when he ain 't . I 'm going out a bit .
Don 't let anybody near Johnny .
I 've locked him in .
No , ma 'am .
There ain 't nobody going to get by me .
Terribly warm today , isn 't it ?
Warm ?
It 's hot .
You look as cool as a cucumber .
What will you have , folks ?
I 'll have some beer , cold beer .
Make it two .
What are you doing down here , big boy ?
Nothing much .
Why ? You don 't look like the kind of a man who comes down this way .
Cigarette ?
I might ask you the same question .
Why ?
You don 't look anything like these other women .
Give me time .
Couple of schooners .
There you are .
Why don 't you tell me what you 're doing here ?
I 'm not doing much of anything .
On the level , I 'm not . Quit your kidding .
You 've never had an idle day in your life .
I can tell .
You 're a man who 's been up and around .
A go-getter , that 's what you are .
Say , you 're a pretty smart girl , aren 't you ?
Am I ?
What kind of business do you think I 'm in ?
Rich man , poor man , beggar man .
- Thief .
- You 're getting hot .
Doctor , lawyer ...
I give up .
But I know it 's something very active and exciting .
And a little dangerous , too .
I got to hand it to you , baby , you almost hit the nail right on the head .
I thought so .
Who are you after , a bank robber ?
Not this time .
Just a woman and a kid .
But she 's given us one of the longest and toughest chases we 've ever had .
How do you know she 's in this neck of the woods ?
I know , all right . I got the whole border covered .
She hasn 't got a chance in the world .
You say she got away from you before .
Yeah , I 'll have to hand it to her .
I had her all sewed up in Baton Rouge , or at least I thought so .
But she leaves a hot trail behind her .
The faster she has to travel , the faster she has to work .
You ought to hear some of the suckers squawk .
She takes them like Grant took Richmond .
I was only one day behind her in Savannah .
But she played a one-night stand on me and beat it down here ... while I was following a chump steer ... all the way up to Memphis and back for the last month .
Well , she had a bit of a rest , anyway .
You sympathise with her , don 't you ?
Well , I don 't .
She ought to get wise to herself .
The way she 's living now isn 't doing that kid any good .
Some people might call it mother-love , but I don 't .
What does a man know about mother-love ?
Come on , let 's go .
That 's just what I was thinking .
I 'm getting sick and tired talking about that dame .
Got anything to drink at home ?
You better take something along .
Hello , auntie .
Just browsing around .
Yes , boss , I can see that .
- Make us a couple of highballs , auntie . - Yes , sir .
Mind if I take off my coat ?
No , make yourself at home .
What 's the matter , baby ?
Did I hurt your feelings ?
I haven 't got any anymore .
You mustn 't talk like that .
You seem to be in an awful hurry .
Well , I ain 't exactly got a lot of time on my hands .
I have .
That 's your bedroom ?
Yes . Want to see it ?
I 'll show it to you .
Come on .
Nobody 's going to bite you .
Say , who you got in there ?
What are you trying to do , frame me ?
- Hello , Mummy .
- Hello , Johnny .
I 'll be right with you .
All right , Mummy .
I 'll wait .
Say , is that your kid ?
I 'll give you three guesses , Sherlock Holmes .
You 're Helen Faraday !
What a brain !
What a chump I was .
You pegged me right off the bat , didn 't you ?
Yes , I pegged you right off the bat .
You 've got your badge on your face , not under your coat .
You and your whole crowd .
You could never have caught me , not in a thousand years .
And now get out .
And don 't forget to tell that husband of mine that I 'm giving the kid up .
Not because he hounded me into it , but because I 'm no good .
You understand ?
No good at all . You get me ?
No good for anything .
Except to give up the kid , before it 's too late .
- Daddy !
- Johnny !
My name 's Wilson , Mr. Faraday .
I had charge of the case down here .
- Is there anything else I can do ?
- No , thank you , Mr. Wilson .
When 's the next train north ?
There 'll be a train to Washington in a few minutes .
A ticket and a half . Section .
I 'll be back in a minute .
Johnny , wait here .
I want to talk to Mother .
In this envelope are $ 1,500 .
I 've been wanting to pay this for a long time .
It 's what I owe you for my life .
It would have been better , Helen , if you 'd let me die .
You might as well know what that money means to me .
It represents my life work .
Had I been able to exploit it properly I could have made a fortune .
But I sold my rights and now we 're quits .
Stay away from Johnny , for good .
Give him a chance to forget you .
That 's the only way you can be a good mother to him now .
Johnny , will you go over and say goodbye to Mother ?
Say goodbye to Mother ?
Yes , Johnny .
CLERK : Will you sign your name here , please ?
Daddy says I should say goodbye to you .
Aren 't you coming with us ?
No , dear , I 've got to pack .
I 'll come later .
But there 's nothing to pack .
Why aren 't you coming with us ?
I 'll come later .
Be a good boy and go with Daddy .
When will you come ?
Tomorrow ?
Yes , tomorrow .
Gee whiz , I wish you were coming now .
CLERK : How about a pillow , sister ?
HELEN : [ Slurring ] I don 't need a pillow .
CARDPLAYERS : Go on , beat it .
Get out of my way .
Snap out of it , kid .
Tomorrow is another day .
Maybe for you , but not for me .
Why , what 's the matter with tomorrow ?
I 'm going to kill myself tomorrow , that 's what 's the matter with it .
Me , too .
Make a hole in the water .
Why are you going to kick off ?
'Cause that 's the way I feel .
Isn 't that reason enough ?
That 's no reason for anything .
I 've got a good reason .
Haven 't got a dime .
Never had any money and I never will have .
Is that all ?
I can fix that .
In this envelope are $ 1,500 .
It represents my life work .
Had I had time to exploit it properly , I could have made a fortune !
Queen of Hearts , that 's me .
HELEN :
Queen of Hearts ! CARDPLAYER :
Get out of my way ! CARDPLAYER : You don 't get out of here ...
I 'm not going to stay in this dump anymore .
I 'm going to find myself a better bed .
Don 't you think I can ?
Just watch !
Hello , Townsend , how 's the market ?
I don 't know . Just flew back from Venice .
Going back to the States ?
Yes , day after tomorrow .
How 's the show ? It 's just one of those revues .
I , for one , don 't think I 'll sit through it .
Say , what do you happen to know about this Helen Jones ?
You don 't mean to tell me you 're interested in her !
I didn 't say I was , did I ?
They say she came over from South America about five months ago .
When she got here , she used man after man as a stepping stone .
Then all of a sudden , Paris went wild over her .
That 's all I know , except they say she 's as cold as the proverbial icicle .
- That 's pretty cold , isn 't it ?
- It 's cold enough for me .
Hello , Helen .
Well , if it isn 't old Nick himself .
I expected you to pop up some day .
If this is a dream , Helen , I hope I never wake up .
Let me come backstage , will you ?
I seem to remember you came backstage once before .
[ Singing ] If the moon began to waltz
Or the sun did somersaults
Do you think I 'd care or stop and stare ?
I couldn 't be annoyed
If the hens refused to lay
Or if bulls gave milk some way
Do you think I 'd care ?
That 's their affair
I couldn 't be annoyed
If everyone stood on his head
And on his hands he wore shoes
I 'd still eat crackers in my bed
What have I got to lose ?
If you ate soup with a fork
Or if babies brought the stork
Do you think I 'd care ?
I 'd still declare
I couldn 't be annoyed
CROWD : Bravo !
Well , Nick , did you succeed in forgetting me ?
Forget you ?
I should say not .
I haven 't stopped thinking about you a single day since I last saw you .
How long has that been ?
Must be more than a year now .
It certainly is great to see you again , Helen .
How have you been ? How did you happen to come to Paris ?
How long have you been here ?
Thank you . I 've got a million questions to ask you .
Better not ask them , Nick .
I 'd rather not talk about the past .
Well , let 's talk about the present .
Are you happy ?
Are you in love with anybody ?
I 'm not in love with anybody , and I 'm completely happy .
Funny , isn 't it ?
No , it 's tragic to me .
Wish I were necessary to your happiness .
But I guess I never did mean much to you .
Maybe you did .
Anyway , nothing means much to me now .
It 's better this way , no chains at all .
I haven 't a care in the world .
You 're lying .
Where 's Johnny ?
Home , I suppose , with his father .
Say , I know you better than that .
All this is fake . You care more about Johnny than anything else on Earth .
What if I did ?
I 'm going back to the States day after tomorrow .
Come with me and look up Johnny and break that crust of ice around your heart .
What 's the use of talking about the impossible ?
I 'm not allowed to go near him .
Are you divorced ?
No .
Well , chuck all this and come back to America with me .
Come on , Helen , give me a break , too .
My life isn 't complete without you .
As soon as we land , I 'll manage it so you can see Johnny .
Let 's forget all that .
I don 't want to see Johnny again .
What for ? I 'd go to pieces .
Excuse me , please , but they are calling for Madame .
It is marvellous .
The house is sold out for two months in advance .
You see , Nick ?
I couldn 't leave even if I wanted to .
Drop in again before you go .
I don 't think I will .
Goodbye , Helen . As you like .
Give my regards to New York .
I 'm going to reserve a cabin for you , Helen , in case you change your mind .
The boat train leaves tomorrow at midnight .
Without me .
Sorry about the pudding .
You see , I never tried making one before .
It 's pretty good , Daddy , if you only eat the middle .
Johnny , do you know who that is ?
No , who is it ?
Do you remember Mother , Johnny ?
Sure , I do .
Is that her picture ?
- I don 't think I can do it , Nick . - Nonsense , you 've got to see him .
Come in .
- What is it you want ?
- My name 's Townsend .
- Who ? - Nick Townsend .
I suppose you have a very good reason for coming here ?
As a matter of fact , I have , Mr. Faraday .
Your wife wants to see Johnny .
- Where is she ?
- Right outside the door .
JOHNNY : Who 's that , Daddy ?
It 's bedtime .
Start undressing , will you , Johnny ?
I 'll be with you in a few minutes .
Do you mind going now , Mr. Townsend ?
I 'm very tired . So you have no intention of allowing Helen to see the boy .
No .
Look here , Faraday .
I 'm going to marry Helen .
I 've just read the papers .
Congratulations .
Between you and me , I wish she hadn 't wanted to come here .
But she 's out there , waiting .
I 've been teaching Johnny to forget his mother .
It 's been a pretty tough job and I don 't intend to have my work spoiled .
I see .
You 're not so very well off financially , are you ?
That 's nobody 's business but my own .
Would it be worth , let us say ... $ 1,000 to let her see him for 10 minutes ?
$ 100 a minute ?
Surely , Mr. Townsend , you can afford to be more liberal .
I 'll raise it to $ 1,000 a minute .
$ 10,000 .
How about it , Faraday ?
I suppose you feel pretty good the way you can throw money around .
$ 10,000 for 10 minutes doesn 't mean very much to you , does it ?
It doesn 't mean anything to me .
I can throw money around the same as you can .
Let her come in for nothing .
Come in , Helen .
Johnny 's in the bedroom .
Gee , Mummy .
- Oh , Johnny !
- I 'm glad to see you , Mummy !
Where you been , Mummy ?
Daddy told me you were never coming back .
It 's so good to see you , Johnny .
Johnny , you 're so small and thin .
- But I 'm awfully strong .
- And so dirty . Daddy said I didn 't have to wash tonight .
Do you wash yourself now ?
Would you like me to get you nice and clean for bed ?
Oh , boy ! That would be swell .
Tell Mrs. Faraday , if you will , that I 'm going back to the hotel .
I 'm leaving my car for her .
Good night .
There you are , Johnny , nice and clean .
- Are you going away again , Mummy ?
- Of course not . If you do , will you be back tomorrow night ?
Yes , Johnny .
Please tell me a story before you go , Mummy .
- Which one do you want to hear ?
- The one about Germany .
You know , " It was springtime in Germany . " I haven 't heard that for a long time .
- Father knows it better than I do .
- But he says he 's forgotten it .
Ask him again .
Oh , Dad .
What is it , Johnny ?
Mummy says you do too know the story about Germany .
- I told you I 've forgotten it .
- But try to remember it .
It was springtime in Germany and you were out on a walking trip .
Well , let 's see .
I was out on a walking trip with some other students ... and as I remember it , I was very happy .
And then what happened ?
I 've forgotten .
Don 't you remember you came to a dragon sitting in an automobile ?
Yes , I remember that .
And you went and saw a lot of princesses taking a bath , didn 't you ?
Yes , I suppose I did .
What did you do then ?
I told him to go away , but he wouldn 't until I granted him a wish .
What was the wish ?
He wanted to see me again .
You didn 't want any other wish , did you ?
No , I was very sentimental in those days and very foolish .
Why were you foolish ?
That night you went to a theatre , didn 't you ?
Yes , I went to a theatre .
And then you saw Mummy on the stage and she was very beautiful .
And then your heart went like this .
I didn 't know much about women in those days .
You 're telling it all different .
You tell it , Mummy .
What happened when you saw him ?
- I don 't know , Johnny , dear .
- Don 't you remember , Mummy ?
I could hardly sing .
What happened then ?
You could never guess .
We went walking .
Please walk , Mummy .
And then you came to a park and there was a dark tree and a yellow moon .
You 're not doing it right at all .
You 're supposed to kiss each other .
Better be a good boy and go to sleep , Johnny .
- Your mother 's got to go away now .
- All right , Daddy .
Let me stay with you both , Ned .
That 's where you belong , Helen .
Are you bad luck !
Hiya , Doctor .
Hiya , babe .
- Hey , where are you going ?
- Inside , inside .
No , you ain 't . Only stiffs go in there tonight .
- No kidding .
- No kidding . - What 's keeping you out ?
- I 'm ...
What ? - Listen , we 're pals , ain 't we ?
- Yeah . Get a flash of that .
Yeah , well , it won 't do you any good tonight .
Now , look , I got me orders .
Nobody 's going in there , and that goes for you newspaper guys , too .
Now ... Sergeant , all I want to do is identify a body .
Now , look , walk down the street , because somebody might think I know you .
- Go ahead .
- That 's an idea .
- Hello , Dee .
- Hello .
- Say , say , what 's the hurry , big boy ?
- I just want to use your telephone .
Oh , yeah ? Well , there 's one down at the corner drugstore .
Listen , I haven 't got time .
Will you be a sport ? Come on , act natural .
All right , but step on it .
This is no telephone exchange .
Haven 't I ...
Say , didn 't I meet you in Havana ?
Yes ...
Hello , World ?
Give me the night desk , please .
Yeah .
Willard Keefe .
Yeah , this is Lee Taylor . I 'm down at the Mott Street Morgue .
Just now they bring in the body of an old scrubwoman murdered under very peculiar circumstances .
No , they won 't let me see it .
I can 't get any dope . Police ...
Very good .
I say very ...
What ?
I say I can 't get any dope on it .
Police orders . Just now , Stevens , O 'Halloran and a guy named Dr. Xavier arrived .
- Something 's doing .
- Yeah , I 've heard that one , too .
Listen , you lunkhead , I 'm not clowning . Look out the window , will you ?
- What do you mean , the moon ?
- Certainly I mean the moon .
I 'm laying 10 bucks to a dime it 's another Moon Killer murder .
Well , that 's different .
Now , listen , Lee , stick right on it .
Fine .
I thought I ...
Oh , Rachmaninoff .
How about the Prelude , huh ?
Hey , Mike , just a minute . Please !
Hello , Mike .
Hey , listen , what 's going on across the street tonight ?
I don 't know a thing , Lee .
I 'm walking my beat and minding my own business .
- Well , have you got a cigarette ?
- I never use them . Here , smoke this .
Paddy , the bartender down at the corner , gave it to me .
- Oh , much obliged , Mike . Thanks !
- Yeah , no problem .
- Good gracious !
What you got there ? - Nothing , just a little handshake buzzer .
You see , fits right in the palm of your hand .
You wind it up like that , and it discourages these professional handshakers .
I ought to have one on each hand for my beat here .
- Well , I gotta be going now .
Goodbye .
- So long . I forgot all about that thing .
Don 't ever bring any of those darned tricks around here again .
What 's your theory , Doctor ?
Strangulation by terrifically powerful hands .
You will notice how deeply the thumbs are embedded in the sternocleidomastoid .
And what do you think of this incision at the base of the brain ?
Obviously made by some type of scalpel used for brain dissecting .
But it 's peculiar that this left deltoid muscle should be missing .
- It 's been torn right out .
- Gentlemen , it wasn 't torn .
This is cannibalism .
- This portion of the body was ...
- Impossible ! There 's no doubt about it .
Thank you , Doctor . I appreciate your professional opinion .
I 'm only too happy to be of any service to you , gentlemen .
Now , if you 'll excuse me , I have rather an important experiment in progress that demands my attention every few hours .
I hardly think I can be of any further use to you , so if you don 't mind , I 'm very , very sorry , but I 'll say good night .
Just a moment , Doctor , if you don 't mind .
One thing more .
- Very well , sir .
- Yes , what ? Now , look here , Doctor , this is the sixth murder in the same number of months , all committed in the full of the moon with no apparent motive , by means of strangulation and an incision with a strange surgical knife .
- Yes , it is peculiar , isn 't it ?
- Most peculiar .
- What 's your theory of the killer , Doctor ?
- A neurotic , of course .
- Some poor devil suffering from a fixation .
- Fixation ?
What do you mean ? A knot or kink tied to the brain by some past experience .
A madness that comes only at certain times when the killer is brought in direct contact with some vivid reminder of the past .
- It 's hard to believe that .
- Yes , for a policeman , I suppose it is .
But I tell you that locked in each human skull is a little world , all its own .
Yes , well , what would these reminders be , for instance ?
Anything . The sight of the sea , the full moon .
Anything .
The poor devil , sane at all other times , is forced to live over the scene of the action that first drove him mad .
Very interesting .
Particularly in view of the fact that all these murders occur in the vicinity of your medical academy .
Are you implying that someone in my academy could have done this ?
- I am convinced of it .
- This is preposterous !
I 'm familiar with the character of every student and professor , and they 're all men of the highest integrity .
There are other academies in the state ...
But they don 't have that kind of knives .
The surgical supply house swear they import them from Vienna especially for your institute .
It 's the only place in the country that they 're used .
Commissioner Stevens , if you jump at a hasty conclusion like this , you 'll ruin the integrity of an institution that has one of the finest reputations in the world .
I 'm sorry , Doctor , but I have to start an investigation .
I tell you this first , because I 'm hoping for your cooperation .
Naturally , I shall do everything to protect your institution .
- But the newspapers , the publicity .
- Don 't worry about them .
We don 't want publicity any more than you do .
If my academy is under suspicion , give me a chance to conduct an investigation of my own first .
Surely , with our knowledge of the human brain ,
- we have every facility to catch a madman .
- How would you proceed ?
By immediately studying the pathological reactions of every man placed under suspicion .
Then trap the guilty one by a brain examination .
May I examine the records of your students and faculty ?
Why , assuredly , assuredly . You can come to my office now , if you wish .
But , I beg of you , no publicity , please .
- No , don 't worry .
- Please . Not one newspaper in the country shall hear of this until you 've had every opportunity to clear your academy of suspicion .
Thank you .
Thank you . I appreciate your gesture .
What is it ?
What do you want ?
- Father !
- Oh , it 's you , Joanne .
What is it , dear ?
Nothing . I just came in here to say good night to you .
Father , what are you doing in here in the dark ?
You frightened me . I 'm sorry , Joanne .
I just came here to get those records .
It 's late .
You 're looking very tired , darling .
You 're only heading for a nervous breakdown unless ...
That moon , mixed with this other light , it 's too ghastly .
Father , you worry me .
You promised me you 'd take a rest .
Lately you 've been so ...
No , my dear , I 'm all right .
Just a little nervous , that 's all .
Now , I have some gentlemen next door in the office .
- You run along . I 'll be through shortly .
- But , Father ...
Now , Joanne , please .
This is very important .
Good night .
But , really , gentlemen , this investigation is useless .
The academy is closed .
The students are away on their vacations .
It surely isn 't wise to spend your time on this .
What 's that ?
Probably Professor Wells .
He 's in his laboratory .
What 's he doing here if the school 's supposed to be closed ?
It 's not an unusual thing for the faculty to spend their evenings here at this time .
Vacation period is the only opportunity they have to do their personal research work .
What 's the history of this man ?
- Well ...
- I 'm waiting , Doctor .
Professor Wells is a student of cannibalism .
He 's written a book about it .
Why didn 't you tell us this before ?
It 's as good as a conviction .
I hardly think so .
I 'm very fond of Dr. Wells .
He couldn 't possibly do a thing of this sort .
- May I talk to him ?
- Why , certainly .
Certainly . Come this way , gentlemen .
What a very strange , uncanny place you have here , Doctor .
What are all these doors ?
They are the laboratories of my faculty .
Dr. Wells , Dr. Duke , Dr. Rowitz , Dr. Haines .
And all those men are here at this hour of the night ?
They seldom leave .
They live for their work .
After all , this is a research institute .
I should like to have a little talk with these gentlemen .
Of course .
I 'm sorry to disturb you , Professor Wells , but I would like to introduce some friends of mine .
- May we come in ?
- Of course , of course , gentlemen .
Come in . Come closer .
- This is Mr. Stevens .
Mr. O 'Halloran .
- Professor , how do you do ?
How do you do ?
That 's interesting , isn 't it ?
If this experiment is successful , we will be a little nearer the secret of life .
What is that ?
That 's a heart .
I 've kept it alive for three years by electrolysis .
Electrolysis ?
Professor Wells is accomplishing remarkable findings in nerve reflexes .
- You flatter me , Doctor .
- Oh , no , no . I understand , Professor , that you live just for your work ,
- that you seldom leave the institute .
- Not necessarily .
I played truant a short while ago .
I was down by the waterfront for a breath of air .
- What time was that ?
- You 're not feeling well ?
- Your arm is troubling you ?
- Yes , it 's very annoying .
Well , you 're foolish to sit there in discomfort .
- lf you gentlemen don 't mind , I ...
- Why , of course not , of course not .
I put it on just as I heard you coming .
An empty sleeve is revolting to most people .
Well , I think we 've taken up enough of Professor Wells ' time .
- Oh , not at all , Mr. Stevens .
- Thank you , Professor .
Well , gentlemen , shall we be going ?
There are many other interesting things to see .
Yes , let 's be going .
- Good evening .
- Good night .
Thank you for calling .
You know , this is a tough case .
There isn 't much chance of his strangling anybody with one hand .
- Oh , I agree with you .
- Well , that lets him out of the picture .
- Whose room is that ?
- Professor Haines ' .
Is there anything about him that might justify my putting him under observation ?
Well , of course , if you 're just looking for someone to hang suspicion on , there 's not a man on my faculty that wouldn 't come under that heading .
Then , you do know something about this man Haines .
- No , not exactly , except ...
- Except what ?
- Well ...
- Come on , come on .
Well , what is it ?
Dr. Haines and two other scientists were shipwrecked off Tahiti about a year ago while making a study of the coral reefs for the Killary Foundation .
Now what 's that got to do with it ?
- You say they were shipwrecked ?
- Yes , they were adrift for 24 days .
Their supplies were exhausted .
When they were picked up , Haines and one other were delirious .
The third had vanished .
There was no explanation at the time .
Haines later claimed the man had died , and he had thrown the body overboard .
- I should like to meet him .
- Surely . But I am sure that he 's not the guilty party .
The killer is a maniac , and Dr. Haines is one of the most brilliant men in the medical world .
- However , if you insist ...
- I do .
Very well .
Professor Haines ?
Yes . Yes , yes , come in .
Come in , Doctor .
I want you to meet Mr. Stevens and Mr. O 'Halloran .
They 're making a tour of scientific investigation and intend to honor our academy for a short time .
- How do you do , gentlemen ?
- Hope we 're not disturbing you , Professor .
Not at all . I was just relaxing .
Professor Haines is a most intensive worker .
I 've just been telling Mr. Stevens of your phenomenal experiments in brain grafting .
Oh , Doctor , Doctor , come . Come . I want to show you .
I want to show you a new type of brain cell .
- That should be interesting , Professor .
- I 'm sure you 'll find it so .
- On the slide ?
- Yes .
Look .
Relaxing .
Why did you bring the police in here ?
Get them out quickly , or I 'll ...
Professor , do you experiment with all these animals ?
Mankind 's benefactors .
Those little animals whose blood most nearly resembles the human .
Yes .
Yes , yes , of course .
Of course .
But it 's getting rather late , Professor , and Mr. Stevens wants to see the rest of the laboratories .
Now that he 's met you , he can call some other time .
- Delighted . - Thank you , Professor .
- Glad to have met you .
Good night .
- Good night . Good night , gentlemen .
There 's always a certain amount of danger in a laboratory so ...
He 's certainly a strange type .
Well , such men are naturally strange , Mr. Stevens .
Sometimes in the overdevelopment of one part of the brain , another part is weakened .
There 's a type who looks capable of anything .
Oh , I assure you , he 's as timid as a lamb .
He 's inclined to be attentive to my daughter , so I see a lot of him .
- Who 's the next ?
- Dr. Rowitz .
He 's the scientist who was with Haines during the shipwreck .
If you 'll step this way .
- Are you busy , Dr. Rowitz ?
- Always , but it 's a pleasure , gentlemen .
Oh , excuse me .
Mr. Stevens .
Mr. O 'Halloran .
- How do you do ?
- How are you ? - Can I be of any service ?
- Well , we are just looking around , Doctor .
- Oh , yes , of course . - Good evening , Professor Duke .
- How are you feeling tonight ?
- Horrible . Well , I 'm sorry to hear that .
Well , if it makes you feel sorry to hear things like that , then don 't ask questions .
Oh , Professor Duke , Mr. Stevens , Mr. O 'Halloran .
How do you do ?
How do you do ? He 's Dr. Rowitz 's collaborator .
You 're an astronomer , Doctor ?
Not that , sir .
I have an interest in the light qualities of the moon .
If you might suffer sunstroke , might you not suffer some similar evil
- from the rays of the moon ?
- Moonstruck , you mean ?
Exactly , what we call lunacy , from the word luna , meaning the moon .
Latin , you know .
However , the luna rays will never affect you or me , sir .
- Because we are normal people .
- Sure . It affects strangely certain neurotic types .
Yes , moon is powerful .
Why , twice a day it lifts billions of tons of water at high tide that wash the shores of the world , like an eternal old scrubwoman .
Like what ?
Pardon my poetic effort .
Yes , but just what do you mean by that ?
I 'm afraid we 've taken up too much of Dr. Rowitz 's time .
Thank you , Doctor .
That was very , very interesting .
- Good night , gentlemen .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night . You know , this is the doctor 's particular hour for observation , and the moon doesn 't wait , you know .
Did you notice the face on that fellow ?
That sailor who saw the scrubwoman killed tonight says the murderer had a face that was horribly disfigured .
Rowitz certainly fits the description , all right .
Gentlemen , I don 't believe that Dr. Rowitz could commit a crime .
He has such a lovely nature .
Why , he 's the author of several volumes of poetry .
Hello ?
- What are we gonna do ?
- We 're powerless unless he helps us .
You know that as well as I do .
We 've exhausted every clue .
He can help us find the murderer , if anybody can .
And I 'm gonna put plenty of pressure on him and make him do it .
A little nervous perhaps , but nothing more .
Oh , ridiculous .
All right . All right .
You go back to sleep , dear .
Good night .
Doctor , if I permitted you to conduct your own investigation , how long would it take you ?
If you leave me alone ,
I can conduct a series of tests , which in 48 hours will conclusively prove whether or not the killer is a member of this academy .
In the meantime , I should like to check up on all your collaborators .
Who 's there ?
Hey , what 're you doing up there ?
I 'm a building inspector .
I work nights so I won 't get sunburned .
I asked you what are you doing up there ?
I 'm a somnambulist .
I probably came up here to have my head examined .
You come down from there , or I 'll ...
Now , just a minute , I 'll be right down , honey .
Just relax . Everything is gonna be all right and on the up-and-up .
I 'm not used to these .
These fire escapes are a sideline with me .
Now everything is gonna be ...
There 's nothing to worry about .
See , Police Commissioner Stevens is upstairs , and I 'm taking care of the outside .
- By the way , what are you doing here ?
- I 'm Miss Xavier . And we 're not accustomed to having strange men climb all over our fire escapes .
I 'm not accustomed to having strange girls sticking guns in my stomach .
By the way , you 're just the person I wanna see .
I wanna ask you a few questions .
Could you tell me the whereabouts of your father during the last four hours ?
How do you spend your evenings ? I mean , have you ever noticed the Doctor acting strangely ?
I 'm sorry , but I can 't answer those questions .
The Doctor hasn 't been very well lately , and I don 't like policemen or anyone to disturb him .
- Good night .
- Just a minute .
- Have you got a permit to carry that gun ?
- Yes , I have .
Good night .
All right .
I 'll agree to lay off for 48 hours .
But I give you my word , if you don 't succeed , I 'll come in here , seal every door , place everybody under technical arrest , take fingerprints , conduct a rigid inspection .
I don 't care if the whole world knows it .
There have been six murders committed all in the same circumstances .
The evidence points here .
- But , Commissioner , all I want is a chance .
- You 've got it .
- Forty-eight hours .
Good night , Doctor . - Good night .
Good night , gentlemen .
Meddling fools .
This way out , gentlemen .
If you please .
- Who 're you ?
- I am Dr. Xavier 's butler , sir .
My nerves are all shot .
That dumb , potbellied , flat-footed cop .
I dashed that off in five minutes .
I think it 's pretty swell .
- What do you think ?
- It 's okay .
But you stick on Dr. X 's trail , and you get a picture of the Doctor and a statement , too .
Oh , no , not me .
Listen , I wanna get off this story .
Put me back on crossword puzzles , covering woman 's clubs ,
- anything , will you ?
- Say , what 's the matter with you ?
What 's the matter with me ?
Nothing at all . Only I spent all last night laying next to a bunch of stiffs , looking at a lot of goofy guys .
I let a dame poke a gun in my stomach , and then I let a dumb policeman slip me a trick cigar .
Say , you want to draw another paycheck , don 't you ?
Certainly , that 's my aim in life , but I 'd like to keep out of the bughouse to enjoy it .
Eddie , when is Lee Taylor 's week up ?
Oh , wait a minute . Wait a minute .
Can 't you take a joke ?
All right , keep moving , but get a picture of the Doctor .
Here , have a cigar .
How do you do ?
I 'm Mr. Taylor .
- You ain 't a reporter , are you ?
- I should say not .
Well , that 's good .
We 've been overrun with them all morning .
- Gee , they got us goofy .
- I know just how you feel , Miss Xavier .
- I ain 't Miss Xavier .
- Well , that 's funny .
I was told that she was a good-looking girl of about 20 .
I 'm 21-and-a-half .
Oh , fine .
Pleased to meet you .
Gee , ain 't you the kidder , though .
That 's another thing in your favor .
That shows that you have a sense of humor .
What do you want the miss for ?
- My grandmother sent me .
- Your grandmother ?
Won 't you take these flowers ?
- For the miss . - Come in .
Just a minute .
Miss Joan , there 's a man down here wants you for his grandmother .
- I beg your pardon ?
- Oh , how do you do ?
I didn 't know you ...
I 'm awfully sorry .
You know , I felt sure that I 'd hear you coming before you entered .
Well , I suppose I could go back and cough .
Oh , no , no , please don 't bother .
Stay right here .
- You 're sure I 'm not disturbing you ?
- Not at all . Why do you ask ?
You 're so obviously at home here that I feel like a guest .
- You don 't mind if I sit down ?
- Oh , please do .
Oh , how nice . Thank you .
And since you 're my guest , won 't you ...
- Won 't you want a cigarette ?
- No . What I want is to know if you 're really going to take it .
- Going to take it ?
- Yes , my picture .
It 's sticking out of your right pocket .
Well , isn 't that the funniest thing ?
You know , this is really all your own fault .
You have absolutely no business photographing so attractively .
- Thank you .
- And I have a habit of collecting pictures
- of beautiful girls .
- Yeah . - Well , and pictures of their fathers , too ?
- Pictures of their fathers ...
What fathers ?
My father 's picture 's sticking out of your left pocket .
Well , can you beat that ?
How do you suppose that got there ?
Just who are you , anyway ?
Because you 're such a good scout , I 'm gonna break down and confess and tell you .
I 'm Lee Taylor of The Daily World .
- Then you did it .
- Me ? It was you who printed that horrible story of Father in this morning 's paper .
- Horrible ?
You ain 't read nothing yet .
- What do you mean ?
What I mean is ...
Well , don 't you see ?
Your father 's a famous scientist .
He 's been called in on a sensational case .
- That 's news .
- But you 've upset him terribly .
Now , on account of that newspaper story , he has to go some other place to carry on his investigation .
- He hates publicity .
- You mean to tell me he 's leaving town ?
Who 's going with him ?
What time are they leaving ?
- What station ...
- That 's none of your business .
I refuse to say another word to you .
You 're just contemptible and impudent enough to publish it .
Oh , impudent , maybe , but not contemptible .
- Don 't call me contemptible .
- You are contemptible .
You deliberately fooled me last night into believing that you were an officer .
Well , I merely showed you my police press badge .
Don 't you think you 've been here a very long time ?
Listen , honestly , I am ashamed .
But don 't you see ?
This is the biggest thing that 's happened in this town in six months .
If I don 't get something on this story , why , I 'll have to join the army of the unemployed ,
- and you wouldn 't want that to happen .
- I 'd be very grateful to you if you 'd leave .
I didn 't quite get that .
Yeah , would you say it again ?
A little closer . You hard of hearing ?
No , no , but don 't you see ?
That 's the closest thing to anything coaxing that you 've said yet .
- You get out of here .
- Oh , don 't be angry .
Come on , let 's laugh it off .
- Won 't you shake hands and be friends ? - No .
Lucky .
I 've got to get something on this story , or I 'm out of a job .
Hey !
Take this home to your grandmother .
Bad luck .
There is no need to be temperamental .
We are here on a matter of the utmost gravity .
That 's why I 've sent for you so unceremoniously .
We are all under suspicion of murder .
- What ?
- Absurd .
- Ridiculous .
- What imbecile thought that up ?
Gentlemen , I know you 're all acquainted with these recent horrible murders .
Moon Killer murders , as the press calls them .
The investigation has proven that , in every case , the killer has made use of a surgical instrument , a type to be found only in our academy .
- But , Doctor ...
- One moment , please .
Naturally , I prefer to believe that everyone in this room is innocent , but circumstances point to the conclusion that one of us may be guilty , any one of us .
Confound it , Xavier .
Bring us up here on a night like this .
Why couldn 't you have told us this at the academy ?
For a simple reason .
I wish to conduct an investigation of my own , alone , quietly .
And I want your help .
This is a lot of tommyrot .
Don 't you realize what the publicity of a police investigation would mean to us ?
You are quite right , Doctor .
What do you propose to do ?
I want every one of you to submit to a psycho-neurological test , an experiment that I have devised , which I hope will prove each one of us innocent .
But if it should prove otherwise ?
Then , my dear Doctor , surely one 's own farewell to life is preferable to that demanded by the law .
- This is preposterous .
I refuse .
- Good . Then the police will give it to you .
Gentlemen , I consider it a privilege to have an opportunity of proving my innocence .
- Doctor , I 'm ready .
- Thank you , Dr. Rowitz .
- Dr. Wells ?
- Yes .
- Professor Duke ?
- I agree .
- And you , Professor Haines ?
- Well , if they all agree .
- Good .
- Oh , I think it 's a lot of nonsense .
Gentlemen , I suggest you all retire to your rooms and unpack .
In 10 minutes we shall all meet in the laboratory .
A still ?
Wonder where they bottle it .
Bad luck .
You and me both .
Very well , Doctor .
At once .
Your room is at the end of the corridor .
Mine 's over there .
I just fixed yours for the night .
Is there anything else , miss ?
Why , Mamie , what 's the matter with you ?
Your teeth are chattering .
This terrible house .
It gives me the horrors worse than ever .
Well , don 't be absurd .
Go to bed and go to sleep .
Well , I hope you get a good night 's sleep .
- Good night .
- Good night , Mamie .
Good night .
Come , Mamie .
Come .
Come , Mamie .
How would you like to meet a ghost in here , eh , Mamie ?
Well , I 'll tell you one thing .
He 'd be a lot pleasanter than you .
Stop that , Otto .
Stop it .
There ain 't anything in this room to be afraid of .
So you can just stop trying to make me nervous .
Well , well , Mr. Zilch , how are you ?
The smells , don 't they remind you of an embalming parlor , eh , Mamie ?
The only thing in this room that does that right now is you .
Yes , you can laugh now , if you want to , but you won 't laugh tonight when you have to wear these for the experiment .
- Where did Dr. Xavier get that ?
- From the morgue .
The old scrubwoman wore these the night that she was murdered .
Look , Mamie , look here .
You can see some of the blood on them .
- No , Otto !
No , please , Otto !
No , no ! - Look , Mamie . Look , Mamie .
Yes . - I take back what I said , please . - Look , Mamie , look .
Otto , Mamie , what 's wrong with the switchboard ?
What 's going on here ?
- Nothing , sir .
- Yes , there is , Doctor .
- He 's trying to scare me .
- Otto , stop this foolishness .
- Yes , sir .
- Now , pay attention , both of you .
- You have the dress , Otto ?
- Right here , sir .
Mamie , you 'll kindly put it on .
- Put in on ?
But , Doctor ... - Now , I want your help .
You and Otto will enact the last murder of the so-called Moon Killer before an audience I 've selected .
Otto knows all about it and will instruct you in your part .
- What part do I play ?
- The scrubwoman , of course .
- The one who was murdered last night .
- Murdered ? But , Doctor , please , please .
Couldn 't Otto play it ?
No , Otto has his own part , that of the killer .
There 's nothing to be afraid of .
Remember our signals , Otto .
Just as I explained .
Yes , sir .
You see , Mamie , there 's nothing to be afraid of .
There 's nothing ...
How 've you been , babe ?
Now , cut it out , now , will you ?
Cut it out .
You 're right .
How utterly absurd . Good heavens , Doctor , what have you done with your laboratory here ?
It 's nothing like it was at my last visit .
- I 've made a few changes , that 's all .
- A thousand , I should say .
Thermal tubes , huh ?
A blood reaction , by high frequency current , as well .
Dr. Xavier is still working on his theory that strong mental repressions , phobias , hidden in the darkest corners of the subconscious mind can be brought to the surface and made to register through certain reactions of the heart .
- Am I correct , Professor ?
- Precisely .
And tonight I hope to prove my theory .
Now , gentlemen , would you kindly be seated in these chairs ?
We 'll begin the experiment .
Well , if we must , then let us get it over with quickly .
Dr. Rowitz , Dr. Haines and Professor Duke .
And now , gentlemen , with your permission ,
Dr. Wells will assist you in clamping these contact wires to your wrists .
Are yours included ?
Certainly .
As close as possible .
But , see that the connections aren 't too tight .
You 'll be quite comfortable .
Pardon me a moment , Doctor , as I attach the contact clamp .
That 's it . Thank you .
Did I have to come all the way down from the city to play guinea pig for you ?
I 'm sure you 'll forgive me in just a few moments .
- We 're ready , Professor . - The moon .
Perfect .
- Just as though we 'd ordered it .
- Close those curtains .
Give me the shivers .
Moon shining right in my face .
- Oh , no , no . No , leave them alone .
- Close them !
- Shall I ?
- All right , you may close them , Wells .
Now , listen , please , to what I have to say .
One of us in this room may be a murderer .
A murderer who killed by the light of a full moon , leaving his victim 's body mutilated .
A cannibal .
Evidence shows the killer has two hands .
Therefore , only Wells is eliminated .
So I shall ask him to work the apparatus .
Wells ?
Wells ? How about me ?
A hopeless paralytic .
Silence , please , Professor .
Wells , will you take your place outside in the recording cabinet ?
Yes , Doctor .
I 'm going to leave you for a moment now , while I check the variability of your blood reactions .
I suggest that you remain silent during my absence .
Wells , the young quack .
Had him for an intern before he could grow a beard .
If you ask me , I think Dr. Xavier is using very unethical methods .
Necessity has no ethics , sir .
Gentlemen , I am now turning on the 100-milliampere , high-frequency coil .
Your pulses are connected with the magnetic rotators , and each variation of your heartbeat reaction is amplified 4,000 times .
The rotor of the electrostatic machine is connected in multiple series with a bank of glass-plate condensers , and the discharge causes irradiations to the thermal tubes , which , in turn , indicate your increased pulse rate and nerve reactions .
We can proceed now .
One moment , Doctor .
Were the murdered women attacked ?
Does your mind never run into any other channel ?
What do you mean by that statement ?
I mean that your sadistic tendencies may someday carry you too far , Dr. Haines .
- You , you ...
- Silence , gentlemen , please .
Now , it is my theory that one of us in the past , through dire necessity , was driven to cannibalism .
The memory of that act was hammered like a nail into the mind of that man .
Shrewd and brilliant , he could conceal his madness from the human eye .
Even from himself .
But he can 't conceal it from the eyes of the radio sensitivity .
Every time his heart beats from mental excitement , the thermal tubes will betray him .
You are all now connected with these tubes . I am myself .
But I alone know which tube is yours .
Your heart beats are being reflected before you .
Doctor , I protest !
As the heart beats faster and faster , so does that red liquid begin to pulse and rise until terror takes hold of the subject , and the liquid rises to the very top of the tube .
He whose tube does that is the guilty man .
Here are a line of wax figures , lifelike reproductions of the pitiful victims , people whose lives were snuffed out and whose bodies were torn to satisfy the desires .
First , a woman of the streets , killed in the tenement district .
Her body found late at night in a gutter .
The next victim , a middle-aged woman , killed just before dawn as she was on her way to market .
Her bleeding body found under a dock by the waterfront .
Then , a dope fiend , strangled and mutilated in the doorway of a dance hall .
Next , a beautiful young girl , violently killed as she lay on a hospital bed recovering from an illness .
Oh , I 'm so afraid .
I 'm shaking like a leaf .
Keep quiet .
Get ready .
Watch .
You 're about to see reenacted the murder of the killer 's latest victim .
An old scrubwoman .
She 's coming home from work .
It 's late .
A full moon shines down upon her .
She 's passing through an alleyway when suddenly a terrible figure steals out , starts creeping towards her .
As old Annie stoops to pick up a newspaper , the figure suddenly takes her throat in his powerful hands .
Get your hands off me , Otto . You 're hurting my throat .
- Turn on the lights !
- Someone 's coming in the room !
Stop it , stop it , I can 't stand any more !
Xavier , turn on the lights !
I can 't get my breath .
- The lights !
- Look at that tube .
It 's a success .
The guilty man is ...
The guilty man is Rowitz .
Rowitz .
Look , what 's happened to him ?
- He 's been murdered .
- Let me see .
What 's the matter ?
What has happened ?
Stabbed in the base of the brain .
Murdered like all the other Moon Killer victims .
- Who was sitting on his left side ?
- I was , but I didn 't see anything .
I was watching the experiment .
Duke , you 're walking !
I walked .
You saw me .
You saw me , I walked .
I walked .
- You walked ?
You faker , you killed him .
- Quiet , Haines .
Don 't you recognize hysteria reaction when you see it ?
- Otto , help him .
- Take it easy , Doctor .
You 'll need all your strength for your work tonight .
Wells ? Where 's Wells ?
The contacts are broken .
Why doesn 't he come in ?
Take him to another room .
Wells !
Wells !
Wells !
Wells !
Wells !
Wells !
What 's wrong , man ?
I don 't know .
The lights went out .
Someone called my name .
I started for the laboratory , and someone struck me .
Oh , this is terrible !
Easy , now . Let me help you .
I will be all right in just a moment .
Watch your head .
Are you sure you heard no one approaching the room when we started the test ?
No one .
Nothing unusual happened until I was struck .
Father , something terrible has happened to Dr. Rowitz .
- I just saw him ...
- Now , Joanne , dear , be calm .
Dr. Rowitz has met with an accident .
- I wish you 'd go back to your room . - He 's dead ?
You can 't do anything here , Joanne .
It 's best that you go back to your room .
- Your father will explain everything later . - Now , come , Joanne .
Come .
Doctor . Doctor .
- What is it , Haines ?
- There 's someone hiding in this closet .
What ?
Another one ?
Who is it ?
He 's the young man who was at the house today .
He fainted .
- Some water , Otto , quickly .
- Yes , sir .
I took the liberty of having something on hand
- for just such an occasion , sir .
- Thank you .
Here , young man , drink this .
How 's that , huh ?
It 's not bad .
How much do you pay for it ?
He 's all right now .
What were you doing in that closet ?
- Hiding .
- Who are you ?
Lee Taylor , The Daily World .
You wouldn 't give me a break , so I had to take it .
- You 're lying .
- Don 't be absurd .
He is a newspaper man .
He 's the one who printed the story about you in yesterday 's World .
I 'm sorry .
You see , I had to get the story .
I was hiding in there , and everything was going great , when all of a sudden , well , I guess I just fainted .
It 's gonna be kind of tough if I have to lug smelling salts around with me the rest of my life .
Yes , well , newspaper man or not , you 're an impostor .
I don 't like your methods .
I shall hand you over to the police .
- Otto ...
- That suits me .
I 'll phone my story in from the police station .
- You 'll phone no story .
- Father , let me talk to him , will you ?
I can 't let this story get out now .
It 'd ruin everything .
But , Father , please let me talk to him . Mr. Taylor .
Just in case .
- You 're not gonna let him go ?
- Certainly not . Otto , watch him .
Don 't let him get near a phone or leave this house .
Yes , sir .
Oh , no , no . I 'm absolutely all right . Now don 't ...
Don 't you worry about me .
I gotta dash off to my newspaper .
- See , they won 't wait .
- Mr. Taylor .
You don 't have to report to the paper what you 've just seen , do you ?
I 'm sorry , but I 've got to .
You see , this is the most sensational case that 's broken in six months ...
I know .
But can 't you wait ?
Won 't you give Father a chance to find out who 's doing it ?
What difference does it make to the public what happens or how he does it so long as he catches him ?
It makes a lot of difference .
The public want to read about it .
The more sensational it is , the more the son-of-a-guns love it .
Is that all you think about ?
Sensationalism ?
Don 't you ever think about people 's feelings ?
Can 't you realize what a scandal would do to my father 's institution ?
Certainly I can , but don 't you realize that I 'm in a hard-boiled racket ?
Then , why don 't you help us instead of making it so much more difficult for us ?
Aren 't we going through enough trouble ?
Look at the trouble I 've been through to get this story .
I lay down at the morgue with a bunch of stiffs .
I looked at a lot of goofy guys .
I let a dumb policeman ...
Will you at least stay the rest of the night and talk it over with Father in the morning ?
I tell you what I 'll do .
I 'll hold off on this story , and I 'll stay , if you let me have breakfast with the family in the morning .
I think it can be arranged .
Father usually has breakfast at 7 : 30 .
- And you ?
- Oh , I am lazy . I have mine at 9 : 00 .
Oh , you have no idea how lazy I am .
- Could I have mine at 9 : 00 ?
- Possibly .
And will you take me for a swim afterwards ?
- A swim ?
- At the beach .
If you 're so helpless you can 't find the water , you 've no business in it .
But I like the water and ...
I am sorry , miss , I had no intention of disturbing you .
That 's okay , Otto .
- There 's old man bad luck again .
- I am sorry .
That 's all right , Otto .
I 'm glad you 're here .
Mr. Taylor 's staying for the night .
I 'd like you to prepare a room for him .
I have already done so , miss .
May I suggest that you do not disturb your father any further tonight ?
- He is very tired .
- That 's a good idea , Otto .
Are you going swimming with me in the morning ?
No , thanks .
Good night .
What will you do if I start to sink and yell for help ?
Throw you an anvil . Good night .
This way , sir .
- Do you sleep very soundly , sir ?
- Like a rock .
- I 'm sorry to hear that .
- Why ?
Because this is a very strange house .
- You 're telling me .
- This way , if you please .
Father .
Father .
Father ?
Father !
Joanne .
What are you doing here ?
Well , dear , I just wanted to be sure that the incision was made by a brain scalpel .
Come .
- Professor Haines .
- Haines , why are you here ?
I couldn 't sleep .
So I came down here to make a more thorough examination of the body .
Professor , I ...
Father , will you please come to bed ?
All right , darling , now , you run along , and I 'll be right up .
- Good night .
- Good night , dear .
Professor , since we retired , this body has been ...
- It has been ...
- I know , but I don 't want her to know .
What are you laughing about ?
Oh , I know . This .
" Hate , friendship , love . " I don 't blame you .
It 's so banal .
Like those postcards you buy .
You know ?
- Yes .
- About " I wish you were here , "
and " Two little doves billing and cooing . "
Oh , no , really .
I was just thinking of something .
Of what ?
- Come on , let 's go in the water , shall we ?
- Oh , no , no , no .
Oh ! Water and I are not very good friends .
No , listen , when was a little kid , I was very , very delicate , see ?
- But very good looking .
- Yeah ?
Yeah , well , I won a first prize in a beauty parade .
- A baby parade at Asbury Park .
- How sweet .
But my mother was constantly dunking me in a tub of water , and I would get soap in my hair and in my eyes and my thing .
And water and I are not very good friends .
So , let 's stay right here , huh ?
Why not ?
- There 's somebody watching us .
- Where ?
Look .
Oh , this is a terrible place .
I wish I were away from it .
If you only knew the things that have happened .
Listen .
Forget that I 'm a newspaperman .
I wouldn 't betray your confidence .
Don 't you see the only thing I 'm concerned about is your safety ?
Are you worried about your father ?
Yes , I am , terribly .
I wouldn 't be .
He 's very tired .
He 's working under a terrific strain .
- He 's bound to show it .
- I know .
But last night , after everyone went to bed , I saw my father bending over Rowitz 's body .
I saw ...
Oh , it 's a terrible thought .
Oh , snap out of it .
Let 's get dressed , and we 'll ...
Oh , we 'll have breakfast .
That 's right .
Well , I 'll let you know , your eyes ...
Your eyes are so blue , when I look into them ...
That 's right , Mamie .
You drink it , and you 'll go right to sleep .
Nothing 's going to hurt you .
She 'll be all right as soon as this sedative has taken effect .
But the Doctor will be mad if I can 't go through with it .
No , Father knows you 're sick .
Of course he won 't be angry with you .
Don 't you worry about the experiment .
I 'm sure the Doctor will make other arrangements .
I can 't do it . I can 't .
Something tells me if I go in that room tonight , tomorrow I 'll be in my coffin .
Now , now . You just be quiet and forget about everything .
Oh , Miss Joan , something horrible is gonna happen .
I feel it in my bones .
Last night I dreamed I was walking up to a casket , and when I looked inside , it was me .
Here , now , now , now .
You 'll be getting hysterical again .
You 'll be all right .
Just go to sleep .
In the morning you 'll feel fine .
I think we 'd better leave her alone , Joanne .
No , Miss Joan , please don 't go .
I don 't wanna die .
I 'm too young to die .
I 've got too much to live for .
No .
- How 's Mamie ?
- She 'll be all right .
Don 't worry .
- Thank you , Dr. Wells .
- It 's quite all right .
What 's become of that newspaper fellow ?
Have you seen him ?
Not since dinner .
He went directly to his room .
I 've been looking for him everywhere .
I have a feeling that he 's sneaked out and phoned the story of Rowitz 's murder to the papers .
Publicity of that sort would ruin everything .
I don 't think he 'd do that .
He gave you his word .
I asked you not to let him out of your sight , dear .
- Why don 't we look in his room ? - Oh , will no one obey me anymore ?
Bad luck .
Skull , crossbones .
Death .
Hello ?
- Oh , yes .
- Did you find him , dear ?
- No , not yet , Dad .
- He 's right here , sir .
- For me ?
- The Commissioner of Police , sir .
Thank you .
- Hello , Commissioner .
- Look here , Doctor ,
I 've decided to send an undercover man up there tonight when you start your tests .
No , there won 't be any tests tonight .
You 'll have to give me another 24 hours .
Well , the woman I was depending upon was taken sick this afternoon , and it spoils all my plans .
Well , I 'm sorry , but if things have gotten beyond your control , I 'm coming down there right away to take charge .
I 'm in a tough spot .
I 've got murder enough already to explain to the press and public .
- And if you think for a moment ...
- One moment , Commissioner .
The 48 hours aren 't up yet .
Well , I have to make some other arrangements .
Hold your men up just a little longer .
Give me one more chance , please .
All right !
I 'll give you until midnight .
If you haven 't got your man then , I 'm coming down there and slap the whole place under arrest .
Yank you all up to headquarters whether you like it or not . Father , I want to help you .
You can 't count on Mamie .
- Let me take her place .
- You ?
No , I couldn 't ask you to do that , Joan .
But please , Dad .
You get a squad car down to Blackstone Shoals at midnight , sharp .
Yes , sir .
Put the signal button on the control table and attach the wires to the thermal tubes .
Yes , Doctor .
What 's the meaning of all this paraphernalia ?
Idiotic nonsense .
These chairs are too far apart to protect us from each other .
The contacts have all been checked .
You 'll be ready in just a moment .
- Thank you , Wells .
- Doctor , I still think you 're making a mistake using Joanne in this experiment .
After all , gentlemen , this is my daughter 's own suggestion .
I have no fear for her safety .
She 's a sensible girl and knows what she 's doing .
Yeah , and if she were my daughter , she wouldn 't be up there on a bed in nothing but a nightgown just to satisfy some lunatic 's experiment .
Professor Duke , don 't criticize Joanne for her state of undress .
This argument is irrelevant .
Doctor , you forget that last night there was a murderer at large in this room .
And the murderer is still here .
I 'm convinced .
But I 've taken precaution against that .
You will each of you be handcuffed to your chairs , and you 'll notice that each chair is bolted to the floor .
I refuse to submit !
You 'll have us in straightjackets next !
I won 't sit here handcuffed while you 're running around loose .
I intend to be handcuffed also .
That will assure us there can 't possibly be a repetition of last night 's tragedy .
Oh , Wells .
They 're very becoming to you , Haines .
It is time to get ready .
Aren 't you afraid , miss ?
There 's only one thing I 'm afraid of , Otto .
That 's Father 's health .
He 's been working so hard , and lately he seems so strange .
The human mind will only stand so much .
We are all a little strange up here .
That 's why I want Father to get away from here .
He needs a long rest .
He 's promised me that just as soon as this is over , he 'll go abroad with me .
You are right , miss .
Don 't be afraid tonight .
Be sure you keep your eyes closed .
And relax .
Is that all , Doctor ?
Yes , everything 's set .
Now , go to the electric cabinet and do exactly as I told you .
Throw on the current the moment you are ready .
Yes , sir .
Doctor , has it ever occurred to you that Wells is free to do as he pleases ?
I 've guarded against that also .
Wells wishes to be treated the same as we are .
- Otto .
- Yes , sir ?
Bolt all the doors so that no one can get in .
- The rest you know .
- Yes , sir .
Here are the keys .
Synthetic flesh .
Synthetic flesh .
And now you are about to witness one of the most gruesome crimes of the Moon Killer .
The death of Florence Johnson .
Murdered and horribly mutilated as she was lying weak and helpless on a hospital bed .
It 's midnight , a private room at the Arch Hospital .
The nurse leaves the room for a moment .
The girl is alone when suddenly ...
When suddenly the Moon Killer appears .
He crosses softly to his victim .
It 's the killer !
- The killer !
- The killer !
Fight him off , Joan !
- Joanne !
- Wells , Wells .
Otto !
Wells !
You idiots are calling for Wells ?
It 'll do you no good !
There isn 't any Wells !
Look , the keys .
Well , take them .
It 's Wells .
- Wells !
- Yes , it is Wells .
But a new Wells .
A Wells whose name will live forever in the history of science .
Go ! Run , Joanne !
Run , run !
Joanne , get up , run !
The keys . The keys . The keys .
Look at his hand .
Horrible !
Yes , look at it , a real hand .
It 's alive .
It 's flesh .
Synthetic flesh .
For years I 've been searching to find the secret of a living manufactured flesh .
And now I found it .
You I think I went to Africa to study cannibalism ?
I went there to get samples of the human flesh that the natives eat .
Yes , that 's what I needed .
Living flesh from humans for my experiments .
What difference did it make if a few people had to die ?
Their flesh taught me how to manufacture arms , legs , faces that are human !
I 'll make a crippled world whole again .
Doctor , your name will be remembered .
You 've given your life , everything to science .
All but one thing , and now you 're gonna give even that to science .
Your daughter .
Oh , if only I were not powerless here in chains .
Run !
Fight him off , Joanne ! Fight him off . Save her !
Joanne !
Run ! Run !
Club him ! Club him !
- Joanne !
- Where 'd he go ?
Oh , Father ! Father !
- Joanne !
- Oh , Father .
- Are you hurt ?
- No , I 'm not .
- Lee !
- Yes .
- Lee !
- Wells .
Where 's Wells ?
What happened to him ?
Calm down .
He won 't ever come back .
I hit him with a lamp .
It was a long throw , but ...
You know , I used to be a first baseman in high school .
You know , that old peg over to third .
Take a look at him .
- Are you hurt , Lee ?
- I 'm all right .
Are you okay ?
Oh , I 'm so glad . Because you ... I want to ...
I better keep my mind on my work .
You say you can 't understand me ?
I 'm talking too fast ?
You 'd be talking fast , too , if you 'd been through what I 've been through .
Boy , am I out .
Now listen , listen , Willard , I want you to give Dr. X full credit for trapping him .
Dr. X. Now I 'll call you back in five minutes with more details .
More to follow , more to ...
Oh , Mr. Taylor .
I can 't tell you how grateful I am for all that you 've done for us .
Oh , you 've got my heart going a mile a minute .
Your heart ?
Oh , I 'm so glad .
Wait a minute .
Take this to the society editor .
It is rumored that , on her return from Europe ,
Miss Xavier will have a very important announcement to make concerning a very promising and prominent young newspaperman .
More later .
Say , tell me how in the world did you ever overpower that terrible monster ?
Oh , I ...
In the third round , I found out that he was very ticklish in a certain spot .
But I haven 't found your weakness .
- Don 't you know ?
- You don 't mean ...
Come here to me .
Oh , Mr. Taylor .
We didn 't lie to you , folks .
We told you we had living , breathing monstrosities .
You laughed at them , shuddered at them ... and yet , but for the accident of birth ... you might be even as they are .
They did not ask to be brought into the world ... but into the world they came .
Their code is a law unto themselves .
Offend one ... and you offend them all .
And now , folks , if you 'll just step this way ... you are about to witness the most amazing ... the most astounding living monstrosity ... of all time .
Friends ... she was once a beautiful woman .
A royal prince shot himself for love of her .
She was known as the peacock of the air .
She 's the most beautiful big woman I have ever seen .
Why , Hans , how you talk .
I should be jealous pretty soon .
- Don 't be silly . - Don 't be silly ?
I 've seen these women making eyes at my Hans .
Of course , I ain 't jealous .
Frieda , my dear ... I have eyes for only one woman ... the woman I asked to be my wife .
Fräulein Frieda ?
Are you laughing at me ?
- Why , no , monsieur .
- Thanks. I 'm glad . - Why should I laugh at you ?
- Most big people do .
They don 't realize I 'm a man with the same feelings they have .
Thank you .
You are so kind , monsieur .
- Nice . - Don 't .
You must come to see me sometime , and we 'll have a little wine together .
Probably , last night you had too heavy a dinner , and now your imagination is- -
But , Monsieur Duval , at first I could not believe my own eyes .
A lot of horrible , twisted things , you know , crawling , whining , laughing- -
Be done , Jean . What were you drinking last night ?
Nothing , monsieur , I assure you .
Monsieur , there must be a law in France to smother such things at birth ...
- All right , Jean . If there 's anything like you say on my grounds , we 'll have it removed .
- Come on , let 's go .
- All of you ! Tout de suite !
Go away , all of you !
Don 't you know trespassing is the same as stealing ?
I 'm sorry , monsieur .
These children are in my circus .
Children ? They 're monsters .
Your circus. I understand .
So you see , monsieur , when I get a chance ... I like to take them into the sunshine ... and let them play like ... children .
Children .
Please forget what was said , madame .
You are welcome to remain .
Au revoir .
Thanks a thousand , monsieur .
Shame !
How many times have I told you not to be frightened ?
Have I not told you ... God looks after all his children ?
- Good evening , Madame Tetrallini . - How are you , Madame Tetrallini ?
Big crowd tonight .
There she goes , taking them out to exercise .
Nurse to a lot of mangy freaks .
" Just as they are represented on the banners ...
" Living , breathing monstrosities .
" Josephine Joseph , half-woman , half-man . "
Have a cigar , Joseph .
You dropped your lipstick , Josephine .
Don 't get her sore , or he 'll bust you in the nose .
Come on . Hurry up .
You 're all wrong. I didn 't do it .
What are you trying to do , be funny ?
You just don 't understand .
A Roman lady ... .
Can 't a Roman lady itch ?
- Why don 't you take a bath ?
- l did , but it 's the bull that needs the bath .
I think she likes you ... but he don 't .
Those flowers you sent to me , they were beautiful .
But not much beautiful as you .
Thank you .
And Hans , I don 't like to ask ... but may I have the loan of another 1,000 francs ... until my money from Paris arrives ?
- With pleasure , Fräulein . - Thank you .
I 'll bring it to your wagon tonight .
Forget it .
- Maybe I was just fooling . - Fooling ?
" Come , little girl , I want to take care of you . "
And I fell for that .
Forget it .
So , you 're quitting .
is that it ?
Maybe I 'm only fooling .
You are not quitting me ! Because I 'm kicking you out !
No , you don 't. I gave you this .
Why , you cheap ... .
Don 't you come around crying tonight , trying to get back in .
I 'm through wasting my time and money ... on things like you .
Yes . Your time , but my money .
Ungrateful little tramp .
What are you staring at ?
Didn 't you ever see a lady move before ?
I guess you 've been listening to every word he said .
That 's it .
Go ahead and laugh. lt 's funny , ain 't it ?
Yeah .
Women are funny , ain 't they ?
They 're all tramps , ain 't they ?
Except when you can get money from them .
I 'll be ... .
Who do you think you are , shooting off your head ?
This is Phroso you 're talking to .
Not any of those thugs you 've been chasing around with .
- Now , you listen to me .
- l didn 't mean you .
- l had to take it out on somebody .
- Yeah , you dames are all alike .
You 're sharpshooting , you 're cheap ... and how you squeal when you get what 's coming to you .
Easy , kid .
Cut it !
It 's my own fault .
What gets me so cockeyed sore at myself ... is that I fell for that big hunk of beef .
So you finally got wise to yourself , did you ? The funny thing about you women is most of you don 't get wise soon enough .
You wait until you 're so old , nobody wants you .
Nobody does , most of the time .
You ought to be tickled to death you 're washed-up with him .
You 're not so hard to look at .
Give yourself a tumble .
You 'll make the grade .
- Your breaks is coming .
- Coming ? Gone , you mean .
Now you 'll sit there feeling sorry for yourself .
No , I ain 't .
Don 't you ever accuse me of that .
All right .
But one thing , don 't go out filling your hide with booze , celebrating ... 'cause fun what 's got that way never done no one no good .
Get me ?
I got you .
You 're darn right I am .
You should have caught me before my operation .
- Hello , Phroso .
- Well , well , well .
- Tomorrow night 's the big night , Daisy ?
- Yes , the sister 's getting married .
- And I 'm thrilled to death .
- She thrills at anything .
- Roscoe 's a good kid .
- She 's only joking .
She 'll like him lots after she knows him better .
That reminds me .
Go ahead , close them .
- What did I do ?
- Pinched Daisy 's arm .
What do you know about that ?
Her master 's voice is calling .
Getting fresh ?
I don 't like it one ... .
Come on , you 'll have to hurry .
We haven 't much time .
So you were flirting with that cheap clown , were you ?
- No , I wasn 't .
- He was doing a trick with me .
You shut up .
- l saw him getting familiar with you .
- Come on , Daisy .
No , you don 't .
She 's going to stay right here .
No , she isn 't. I got to go .
You 're always using that for an ... . For an alibi .
Where are you going ?
You don 't look at others so much , do you ?
Yes , I have seen you .
So that 's how it is .
You got to be caught .
Well ?
Come on in .
Help yourself to a drink .
That is fine .
Feel like eating something ?
Always .
Prosit .
How many ?
I 'm not very hungry . About six .
How do you like them ?
Not bad .
But you are strong .
You are squeezing me to death .
And you 'll like it .
You are taking my breath away .
You ... .
Now , here 's something for your eye .
But , Hans , my Liebchen , you have not been listening ... to a word I have been saying .
- Hans . - Yes , Frieda ?
- You have not been listening to me .
- Yes , I have , Frieda. I have .
Then what was I saying ?
You were saying ... .
What were you saying ? I was saying , tonight you must not smoke such a big cigar .
Your voice was very bad at tonight 's show .
Please , Frieda , don 't tell me what I do .
When I want a cigar , I smoke a cigar .
I want no orders from a woman .
Why is it ?
Friedchen , I 'm sorry. I ... .
- There it is . - Five lumps of sugar in each .
The little ape sent to Paris for this ?
Yes , Paris .
We 're doing very well .
But I don 't like fruit .
You should eat a lot. lt 's good for you .
Next time , I tell him I like champagne .
- Who is it ?
- lt 's Hans .
- Who ?
- lt 's Hans .
My darling , your basket of fruit was lovely .
But I am ... taking a bath now .
- Can 't you come back later ? - Yes , Fräulein .
Thank you , dear .
You 'll spoil everything if he hears you .
What 's the matter ?
You ain 't singing as usual . This morning I have such a big washing to do .
How 's Hans ?
I said , how 's Hans ?
Hans is fine .
Frieda , something 's wrong .
Nothing . Only ... .
That Cleopatra woman ... . My Hans ... .
- She 's still after Hans , ain 't she ?
Yeah .
Always she 's smiling by him . Well , if she smiles by somebody I know ... she 'll have to buy herself a new set of teeth .
Why is it we women always has got to worry ?
It 's always been that way .
I guess it always will be .
Yeah .
And , by me , she has no shame .
Always , when I can hear it , she says to him : " Many thanks , my darling , for the flowers .
" Thanks , my darling , " for this ... and " Thanks , my darling , " for that .
Always something he has given her .
That big horse . Yes , but she keeps after him .
That 's why I worry .
Why not pink tights ?
With spangles all around . It will show her figure off more .
Nein . No tights .
Without tights . You know , that soft , flimsy , what-you-call-it stuff .
Where the figure shows through .
Why not like Lady Godiva ?
Ja , that 's it .
And I 'll hire her to ride the back of my bull . Dummkopf ! What have you on your shoulder for heads ?
- What 's the matter , Cleo ?
- l think I strained my shoulder last night .
Give a rub , will you ?
Farther . Down . Over .
It 's so good to be rubbed .
- Our cards , lady . - What for ?
A couple of rubbers from Berlin .
That reminds me. I had a swell dream about you last night .
- You did ?
- Yeah .
You were standing in a bathing suit on a rock . You know , like a statue . The wind was blowing through your hair , the waves were washing around you .
How it stood out . It looked great .
Say , you have got a good figure .
Do you think so ?
- Sure . - Phroso .
Did you try that gag l told you about ?
Yeah , I did , and it was a wow .
Get up here , Johnny. I 'll show it to you .
I did what you told me , and it laid them right in the sawdust .
Watch this , Venus .
- Hello , Venus .
- Hello , Johnny .
Phroso , what else did you dream ? Then the dream changed .
We was in Paris . - Paris ?
- Yeah , at the opera , right in the front box .
- We were all dressed up .
- What did I have on ?
And did I look swell .
Everybody was pointing at me .
They were saying , " That 's Phroso , the clown . "
And was I embarrassed .
- Did they say anything about me ?
- Sure .
- What did they say ? - Hit me .
Go ahead .
Hit me .
On the head .
That 's how it is .
You don 't think it 's funny .
It 's sad , is it ?
It will just panic them , that 's how sad it is .
No .
When ? Come on !
Come on , Venus .
The bearded lady 's baby 's born !
- Ain 't it cute ?
What is it ? - A girl .
Oh , boy , that 's great . And it 's going to have a beard .
- How 's the proud father ?
- What was it ?
- A girl .
Better luck next time .
You may get a couple of Smith Brothers . I 'm trying .
Please , Violet , don 't quarrel with him anymore .
If he 's going to say anything , let him say it . Don 't let him " p-p-p " for an hour .
You 're going to do as I say .
I 'm the boss of my home .
- Half of it , you mean . - Please , Violet .
Listen here. I don 't want those tramps you go with ... hanging around my wife .
Be quiet .
Hook up our dress .
If it isn 't your dress I 'm hooking up , it 's something else .
You got to cut out getting drunk every night , too .
- ls that so ?
- Yeah .
I 'm not going to have my wife laying in bed half the day with your hangover .
Daisy , let 's get out of here .
No , she don 't .
She 's going to stay right here . Come on. I got to go .
You 're always using that for an ... .
Cleopatra ain 't one of us .
Why , we 're just filthy things to her .
She 'd spit on Hans if he wasn 't giving her presents .
Let her try it .
Let her try doing anything to one of us .
You 're right .
She don 't know us , but she 'll find out .
There you are .
I peeked out of the corner of my eye ... and caught Madame Tetrallini giving us the once-over .
One of the best in the business .
It isn 't only our act that gets them .
We 've got personality .
We know how to sell the stuff .
Same way in the last town . Never heard such applause in your life .
Let me tell you something that everybody around here don 't know .
We 're only killing time with this circus .
We 've got bigger time to follow , and we can do it , too .
Catch our act tomorrow night .
We got something new . Yeah ?
Schlitze , what a pretty dress .
How beautiful you look tonight .
You 're just a man 's woman .
You know what I mean ?
If you 're a good girl , when I get to Paris I 'll buy you a big hat ... with a long , beautiful feather on it .
- Hello , Elvira .
Hello , Jennie Lee .
Hasn 't Schlitze got a beautiful dress ? Isn 't that pretty ?
When I get to Paris , I 'm going to buy her a big hat with a long feather on it . And if you 're good girls , I 'll buy you a hat with a bigger feather on it .
Why , Schlitze , what 's the matter ?
I 'm sorry , Schlitze .
Did you see him ?
He was out there again tonight . He followed you from the last town .
I know it , and if Eddie sees it , there 'll be a fight .
- lt ain 't your fault .
- There you are , Frances .
- Thought you 'd gone to bed .
- Hello , Rollo .
Hear that crowd out there again tonight ?
I bet you thought the tent was on fire . Well , it wasn 't .
Just the Rollo Brothers panicking them again .
But then , we do it in every town .
We 're so used to it , it 's getting monotonous . You want to take a look at our act tomorrow night .
Careful .
Don 't waste any of it .
- Look how it sparkles .
- Like your eyes . Dancing , gay , like bubbles .
It 's delicious .
Nice .
It comes by the finest vineyards of France .
And you sent for it especially for me ?
For the most beautiful woman in all the world .
Darling .
Hello there , baby .
Where have you been so long ?
You 're a funny guy , Phroso .
- Sometimes , you panic me .
- Don 't I know it ? I panic the world because I use my noodle .
I think up funny gags .
I make the world laugh . With me , clowning is an art .
The head cold ?
- Thought you and me had a date to go out .
- l forgot all about it .
Well , I 'm into this now .
I 've got to go through with it .
Make it snappy , will you ?
I 'm all dolled up for the occasion . Sorry , kid .
We 'll make it some other time .
Don 't feel that way about it .
I 've got to finish it .
- Funny gag , isn 't it ?
- Yeah , I 'm laughing myself sick .
Come on .
Honey , come on .
Now , now .
That 's much better .
That 's the first time you 've ever done that .
- Ain 't the first time I felt like doing it .
- Yeah ?
I don 't mind telling you I 've wanted to do this for a long time .
- We 're all set now , Venus ? - Yeah . - All set now .
- Yeah .
Please do .
Don 't you want to make me happy ?
- Yes , but I don 't know what to say .
Will you ?
- Yes . - Violet .
What are your kicking about ?
You 've got a good wife . You 're happy . It 's that sister-in-law of mine .
- That 's tough .
- Good night , darling .
Cleo 's gone on a diet .
- lt 's awfully sweet of you to say that .
- And I know Violet will be happy .
- Hello .
- Roscoe , this is Mr. Rogers .
Glad to meet you .
- Violet and he are engaged to be married .
- Yeah ?
Yes , and you must come to see us sometime .
Thanks .
Come to see us sometime , too .
I certainly will .
It 's Frieda , Hans .
May I come in ?
Yes , Frieda .
Now that I 'm here , I don 't know how to say it ... how to make you understand .
If you knew how I feel , Hans ... to come to you about her .
Frieda , I 'm so sorry .
I don 't want to hurt you , but ich kann es nicht helfen .
If you could be happy , Hans ... I would not care .
But I am happy , Frieda .
Never in my life was I so happy .
No , Hans .
You think it only . For you , she cannot bring happiness .
Frieda , you don 't know .
But I do , Hans .
You think because she 's so beautiful and I 'm just- -
To me , you 're a man .
But to her , you 're only something to laugh at .
They make fun by you and her . Let them laugh .
The swine .
I love her .
They can 't hurt me . But they hurt me .
Frieda , I have been a coward .
I should have come to you in the beginning .
Please forgive me .
Yes , Hans , I forgive you . It is only that you should be happy I want .
You won 't worry now , will you ? No , I won 't worry .
Nice .
It 's platinum . Say , where do you think that little polliwog is getting his money ?
Listen at him .
Getting so particular .
What do you care where the money comes from ?
How much it 's worth ? We got $ 500 for the bracelet , but this looks like thousands .
I think next time I 'll take a fur coat .
Say , that little ape 's got ideas about you .
- Jealous ?
- Me ? I 'd squish him like a bug .
That 's his knock .
I 'll get rid of him .
It 's about Hans .
Well ?
I 'm listening . It 's behind his back . Everybody 's laughing because he 's in love with you .
Go on .
I know you just make fun ... but Hans , he does not know this .
If he finds out ... never again will he be happy .
What makes you think that I am just making fun ? You 're big . So beautiful- -
And Hans is so little ... so cute .
Well , maybe I 'm going to marry him .
If you marry , it will be at you they laugh and stare .
Nothing like being different .
Cleopatra ... queen of the air , married to a dwarp .
- A dwarf .
- A dwarp !
Then it 's not for Hans you care .
- lt 's the money .
You little mind reader .
He has told you of the fortune he has inherited .
Always he swear to me ... to tell no one until after we leave the circus . A fortune ?
And fancy you knowing about it , too .
Well , I can 't be angry at him for that .
No .
You cannot do this .
Please . You can 't .
A fortune . I bet the little ape 's worth billions !
A fortune .
Can you beat that ?
And I have him like that .
Shrewd little Hans .
He knew enough to keep his mouth shut .
I could marry him .
Midgets are not strong .
He could get sick . How ?
It could be done .
Done. I know it .
Come on , my little precious .
Come on , let 's drink .
Big , happy drink .
Quiet ! Please be quiet . Hey , Koo Koo , give somebody else a chance .
All right !
All right , professor .
Show him up , volcano .
Our wedding night .
What a thrill .
Never before did I think I should be so lucky .
My little Hans .
My Cleo 's happy . - Happy . - Happy ?
I am so happy . I even could kiss you , you big , homely brute .
My little green-eyed monster .
My husband is jealous . He loves me .
Come , my little lover . Drink to the happiness of your loving wife .
Attention !
We 'll make her one of us .
A loving cup .
They 're going to make you one of them .
You dirty ... slimy freaks !
Get out of here !
You !
Out ! Get out !
You heard her !
You filth !
Make me one of you , will you ?
What are you , a man or a baby ?
You make me ashamed .
Ashamed . You ?
Holy jumping Christmas !
What must I do ? Must I play games with you ?
Must mama take you horsy-back ride ?
Horsy-back ride .
Come , my little flyspeck .
Mama is going to take you horsy-back ride . - Come on .
- Giddyap .
Forget it , Hans .
She is sorry. I 'm sorry .
Didn 't I told you she was drunk ?
Didn 't I told you we was only having a little fun ?
Please . I understand .
- Everything .
- No , you don 't .
I tell you , there 's nothing between me and Cleo .
Be quiet .
Haven 't you done enough damage for one night ?
Don 't you realize what I 'm being accused of ?
I ain 't going to be blamed for something I have not done .
I don 't blame you , Cleo .
I don 't blame Hercules .
Myself .
Now you 're talking .
- Talking like a man . - You fool .
Always I should have known ... you would only laugh at me .
My sweet , I 'd rather fall from the trapeze and break my neck ... than hurt your feelings .
Do you understand now ?
Our wedding ... a joke ?
Now I know how funny it is . Hans the midget .
Hans ... the fool !
They 'll laugh .
Everywhere , they 're laughing .
- You give him too much .
I know what I am doing .
What caused it ? Poison .
A very bad case of ptomaine poisoning .
Doctor , did I do wrong , then ?
Giving him mustard water ? No .
Never before did he drink like that ... but she kept making him , and making him .
You better get Cleo to tell the doctor what she put in that wine last night .
- What you 're talking about ?
- The stuff she put in the wine .
You 're crazy .
You can 't get away with it . I 'll tell the coppers .
So , tell on your own people ?
Not dirty rats what would kill a freak to get his money .
Your imagination 's getting the best of you .
But coppers don 't have imaginations , so I 've been told . Don 't make me have to go to them .
- Cleo . - Yes ?
It has been a week tonight ... since we have been married .
A week , since I have said ... - all those things to you .
- Don 't !
Never can I forgive myself for what I 've said .
I 've forgotten it .
Nothing matters except for you to be well .
So good you are by me , Cleo .
Don 't be lonely .
I 'll never forget what you are doing for me , Cleo .
Now I must hurry .
- Cleo . - Yes ?
Will you leave the door open , please ?
- Tonight .
- They will be ready .
" l must hurry now and fix your medicine , my darling ... " or I will be late . " " Dirty ...
- He 's waiting .
Soon we go .
- You 're imagining things .
- No . Then I hear Hercules tell Cleo :
" Venus knows too much . "
- Hercules ? Venus ?
Thanks , Frieda .
My little , you must go to sleep .
Your friends better go now .
- l like them here .
They can come back tomorrow .
I will give you your medicine and get you off to sleep .
- What 's this ?
You got this bottle of poison ... to kill .
Get out , Venus !
How she got that way will never be known .
Some say a jealous lover .
Others ... that it was the code of the freaks .
Others , the storm .
But , sir , they insist on seeing you .
In all these years , I 've seen no one .
Have I not told you that ?
- Send them away .
- Very good , sir . - l can 't see no one .
- Excuse me , sir .
You can 't come in .
- No , sir. I have my orders .
- Who 's going to stop me ? I 'm in , ain 't I ?
Yes , you can , Hansie , old boy .
There 's someone you 've just got to see .
Why did you come here ?
Don 't be angry .
Venus and Phroso have been so kind by me .
Please go away .
But , Hans , you tried to stop them .
It was only the poison you wanted . It wasn 't your fault .
Don 't cry , Hans .
Come to me , my Liebchen .
Don 't cry .
Don 't cry . I love you .
I love you .
- Hello .
Grand Hotel .
- The line is busy .
Who is this ?
I can connect you with room service .
Hello .
Is that the clinic ?
This is Senf , the head porter , Grand Hotel .
How 's my wife ?
Is she in pain ?
Isn 't the child coming soon ?
Patience ?
Would you have patience ?
This is Otto Kringelein .
Is that you , Heinrich ?
Listen . I 've got to talk very quickly .
Every minute costs 2 marks 90 .
You know that will I made before I had my operation ?
I want you to tear it up .
I came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine , you know ?
It 's pretty bad , and he says I haven 't long to live .
I say , he says I won 't live much longer !
No , it isn 't nice to be told things like that .
You plague , bother , and save , and all of a sudden you 're dead .
I want to get something out of life .
I 'm never going back to Friedersdorf .
Never .
I 'm staying here at the Grand Hotel .
It 's the most expensive hotel in Berlin .
All the best people stay here .
Even our big boss , Preysing , is staying here .
I 'm going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him .
Hello , miss .
This is General Director Preysing .
I want my home in Friedersdorf , please .
Hurry .
Hello .
Is that you , Mama ?
How are the children ?
What news have you from the factory , dear ?
Is your papa there ?
Good .
Hello , Papa , is that you ?
The conference with the Saxonia company is set for tomorrow morning , Papa .
If the merger does not go through , we are in very bad shape , Papa .
Everything depends upon news from Manchester .
If the deal with the Manchester Cotton Company does not go through ... we 're facing a very bad situation , Papa .
I 'm Suzette , Mme. Grusinskaya 's maid .
Madame will not dance today .
She will not go to the rehearsal .
She did not sleep all night .
There is something preying on her mind .
I gave her a tablet , a Veronal .
She 's sleeping now .
This is Baron von Geigern .
Look here , I need money , or I can 't stay at this hotel much longer .
I 've laid the groundwork .
I know the exact position of her room .
I 've made friends with her ballet master , Pimenov .
Listen , Heinrich .
I 've taken all my savings , everything ... and I 'm going to enjoy spending it .
All of it .
It 's terribly expensive here , Heinrich .
But it 's wonderful .
I can 't !
I 'll lose my job .
It 's like being in jail .
Rely on me , Papa .
I will make this merger go through .
I never fail .
Poor Madame .
Her mind is tortured .
I 'm afraid she will ... .
I don 't need advice , thanks very much .
I need money !
Music all the time .
It 's wonderful .
Grand Hotel .
People coming , going .
Nothing ever happens .
Mme. Grusinskaya will not want her car .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car is not to be brought .
- Here .
- Yes , Baron ?
- Adolphus is very vexed with you .
- Yes , Baron ?
You didn 't take him for his walk this morning .
- Your door was locked .
- You might have knocked .
Don 't you realize ?
That 's why they don 't like little dogs in big hotels .
The doors are locked .
They can 't get out .
You see ?
- Yes , Baron .
- I want you to take him for a good walk .
- You understand ?
- Yes , Baron .
- Don 't bring him back till he 's exhausted .
- No , Baron .
Wait a minute .
It 's quite all right .
- Hello ?
- Is that for me ?
No .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car is to be brought .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car is to be brought .
Good evening .
Will you send this to Mme. Grusinskaya ?
- Yes , Baron .
- Thanks very much .
Good evening .
My key , 168 .
- Good evening , Mr. Pimenov .
- Good evening , Baron .
- How is the beautiful lady ?
- Grusinskaya ?
To tell the truth , Baron , tonight we 're a little bit nervous .
Were you at the theater last night ?
I 'm always there when Grusinskaya dances .
- Last night was not so good .
- I thought she was splendid .
Is Mr. Preysing in ?
I 'm Dr. Zinnowitz .
- Mr. Preysing .
Visitor .
- Mr. Preysing .
- Here you are .
- Sorry to have kept you waiting .
Waiting ? I 've been waiting for news from Manchester .
- No news yet ?
- No news .
That 's bad .
You can 't hold out unless you merge with the Saxonia company .
- I know .
- The Saxonia company will never sign ... unless your firm is tied up with the Manchester people .
They don 't have to .
I told you that .
Yes , I know .
I 'm very much worried .
But I have my agent in Manchester .
I 'm expecting a telegram any minute .
You have to create a good impression .
Seem optimistic .
Don 't even mention Manchester to the Saxonia crowd .
Be clever .
No , I cannot do that , Dr. Zinnowitz .
I 'm used to making my deals on a solid basis .
I 'm an honest businessman , a good husband and a father .
I have nothing to conceal .
I could not live happily otherwise .
Yes , I know .
We 'll go someplace and talk it over .
I 'm expecting a stenographer .
Send her to Mr. Preysing 's room . 166 .
Yes , Dr. Zinnowitz .
- Letters for me ?
- No , Doctor .
- Telegrams ?
- No , Doctor .
He always seems to be waiting for something ... but it never happens .
- No messages ?
- No , Doctor .
Yes , I was in the war .
- Your bill , Baron .
- You 're not beginning that again , are you ?
Please pay some attention to me .
I 've no time .
Kindly wait one moment , sir .
- Has anyone asked for me ?
- No , Doctor .
We 're holding the rooms now .
Five bedrooms , two sitting rooms .
- How many in your party ?
- Let me see .
My mother , two sisters ...
- Really , this is an imposition .
- Sir , kindly wait one moment , please .
- That makes nine .
- Yes , madam .
- You wish to have the rooms held ?
- Yes , please .
And then ...
Really , I won 't wait any longer .
I 've been here a very long time .
That 's all right .
Look here , I waited three days before I got a room at all .
When I finally got one , what kind of a room was it ?
- A very nice room , and inexpensive .
- I didn 't ask you for a cheap room .
When I came here to live , did I ask you for a cheap room ?
Did I ?
- If you wait one moment , sir ...
- I can 't wait .
Every day is precious .
Every hour ...
- 176 ?
- ... every minute is precious .
I came to live here for two weeks , maybe three .
Heaven only knows .
I can pay whatever you want .
I 'm tired and ill .
I can 't wait .
- The gentleman has a complaint ?
- He is dissatisfied with Room 559 .
Yes , I have a complaint .
I think it 's a perfectly fair complaint .
I came here from a great distance to live at the Grand Hotel .
I want a room , a big room .
The same kind of room you 'd give General Director Preysing .
I 'm as good as Mr. Preysing .
I can pay for a room the same as Mr. Preysing .
Would you stick him way off in a corner in a little room ... where the water pipes go " pop " all day ?
He can have my room .
It doesn 't matter where I stay .
That won 't be necessary , Doctor .
Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176 .
It 's one of our most expensive rooms .
A large room on the front , and with a bar .
- With a private bar , exclusively mine .
- Certainly , sir .
Exactly what I want .
That 's very kind .
I 'll pay for it now .
- No , I beg of you , sir .
- Pardon me , sir .
You dropped your little hat .
- Permit me .
- Thank you .
Permit me . My name is Kringelein , from Friedersdorf .
- Yes .
I 'm Baron von Geigern .
- A Baron .
Permit me to present Dr. Otternschlag .
A doctor .
Doctor , I 'm ill .
I know .
When a man 's collar is an inch too big for him , I know he 's ill .
I must go and dress now .
- I hope to see you at the theater .
- Surely , sir .
- Is this gentleman a baron , too ?
- Unfortunately , no .
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ?
- I have signed once .
- Have you a minute ?
- I told you not to come into the lobby .
Time 's getting short .
Haven 't I told you not talk to me with a cigarette in your mouth ?
- I want to speak ...
- Later .
Yes , sir .
This way , Mr. Kringelein .
Mr. Preysing .
- Will you go up to 166 ?
- 166 .
Hey , wait a minute !
Hello ?
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car is not to be brought .
She said , " On the other side of the fence . "
Baron , you 're incorrigible .
Poor Grusinskaya .
- How can she receive anyone ?
She can 't .
- No , of course not .
Theater , hotels , trains .
Trains , hotels , theater .
- Quite so .
- I must toddle along .
- She 'll be waking up and calling for me .
- I 'm sorry , old fellow .
Who are you , please ?
I 'm the stenographer .
Then you will please wait outside , please .
Yes , sir .
Outside , please .
Take your time .
Listen , the burial fund and everything .
I 've got it right here .
I 'm going to live .
I 'm going to have a good time while I can .
That 's my creed , Kringelein :
a short life and a gay one .
A short life , Baron , and a gay one .
That 's very true in my case .
You know , I know you won 't think I 'm impertinent ... but perhaps you might have a little better time ... if you bought some new clothes .
Started out fresh , so to speak .
Well , Baron , I didn 't think there was time for that .
But it 's very kind of you to take an interest .
- Friends , then .
- Friends , Baron ?
Thank you .
- Your room is ready , sir .
- Thank you .
I may speak to the Baron anytime I see him ?
Of course , Kringelein .
Why not ?
I mean , when you 're with your smart friends ?
- I haven 't any friends , Kringelein .
- You said me , Baron .
- Friend .
- Bless you , Kringelein .
See you later .
I 've often wondered what would happen to that porter ... if somebody jumped on him from here .
I 'm sure I don 't know .
Why don 't you try it and find out ?
- Thanks very much .
- Not at all .
- Don 't you like dancing ?
- No .
Not with strangers .
- Never ?
- Never .
- Thanks very much .
- Not at all .
- I say ... .
- Are you back again ?
He must be an awful nice fellow .
- Who ?
- Whoever 's keeping you waiting .
Have you seen it ?
- Seen what ?
- It .
You don 't mean 166 ?
That fat , bulbous neighbor of mine , Mister ... .
- Preysing .
- Not you .
Oh , no .
Work .
- Does he sing ?
- I hope not .
- Weren 't you playing something ?
- Yes . The typewriter .
- You 're a little stenographess .
- Yes , I 'm a little stenographess .
That 's fascinating .
I don 't suppose you 'd take some dictation from me sometime , would you ?
- How about some tea , then ?
- Tea would spoil my dinner .
I only have one meal a day , and I 'd rather hate to spoil it .
- Are you reducing ?
- Reducing ?
Me ?
Do I need to ?
No .
It 's perfect .
I don 't think I 've ever ... .
But why one meal a day ?
- Money .
Ever heard of it ?
- Yes , I have , vaguely .
But I always thought little stenographers made little pennies .
- Very little .
- That 's too bad .
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on ?
I have , indeed .
One she 'd bought herself ?
I see what you mean .
Poor kid .
- I wish I were free tonight .
- Aren 't you ?
- What ?
- Free .
No , darn it , I 'm not .
But there 's tomorrow .
- What time tomorrow ?
- 5 : 00 , downstairs .
Where downstairs ?
In the funny yellow room where they dance .
You 're funny .
- Tomorrow ?
- Of course .
Really ?
We 'll dance ?
All right .
We 'll dance .
I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise ... that I might speak to him at any time ?
Mr. Kringelein , how are you making out in the royal suite ?
- Wonderfully , thanks to the Baron .
- Baron ?
- Are you a baron ?
- Strangely enough , yes .
- Then this isn 't the Baroness ?
- Strangely enough , no .
- Do I look like a baroness ?
- You 're attractive enough to be anything .
Thank you , Baron .
You 're nice .
- Thank you , Miss ... .
- Miss Flaemm .
- Miss Flaemm , this is Mr. Kringelein .
- Hello .
- They call me Flaemmchen .
- I like that better .
I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room ?
I 've ordered some caviar and champagne .
It 's very expensive , but that doesn 't matter .
Perhaps Miss Flaemm would join us .
Have caviar , if you like , but it tastes like herring to me .
It does , as a matter of fact .
I hadn 't thought of that .
I 'm sure my beautiful room ... will appeal to your artistic sense .
It has real velvet upholstery .
A-number one .
I 'm in the textile trade , and I know .
I wonder if you 'd like to see my bathroom ?
It has hot and cold running water all day .
Nighttime , too .
I can have a bath anytime that I like .
- No .
- Yes .
Stenographer .
Please .
Her master 's voice .
Goodbye , Mr. Kringelein .
Thank you .
Goodbye , funny one .
Don 't forget tomorrow . 5 : 00 .
- I won 't .
Goodbye , you .
- Goodbye .
- What 's the matter , Mr. Kringelein ?
- Preysing .
- You know him , don 't you ?
- I know him ?
I 've slaved in that man 's factory for years and years .
I know him through and through .
- Sorry , old man .
- I beg your pardon , Baron .
Excuse me .
Won 't you join me in my room ?
I 've ordered some champagne .
Listen , I 'd love to .
I 'll join you a little later .
You know the gentleman we met downstairs , with the face ?
- Who ? The doctor , you mean ?
- Yes .
- He 's a gay old blade , isn 't he ?
- He 's wonderful .
Please , Messieurs , Madame is asleep .
See you later .
- Waiter !
- Please .
Sorry .
Has Madame slept well ?
No , I 've been awake , thinking .
It is time for the performance .
I think , Suzette ...
I 've never been so tired in my life .
Not even the Veronal can help me to sleep .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car is to be brought .
- I can 't dance tonight .
- It will pass , Madame .
Pearls are cold .
Everything is cold and finished .
So far away .
So threadbare .
The Russians .
Saint Petersburg .
Imperial court .
The Grand Duke Sergei ... .
Sergei ... is dead .
It 's all gone .
Mon Dieu .
The pearls , if they were to break ... .
The pearls don 't break .
They hold together and bring me bad luck .
I hate them .
Orchids again , Madame !
No card .
I think they are perhaps from the same young man .
He is at the end of the corridor .
Tall . He walks like a soldier .
Madame must have noticed how often he rides in the elevator with us .
Yes ?
Oui .
- Madame , the car is here .
- Send it away .
I shan 't need it .
Mme. Grusinskaya will not require her car .
No .
She 'll not be going to the theater .
- Time for the performance .
- The performance .
Poor little Lisebeta .
She still has her stage fright .
It will pass .
- It 's not stage fright .
It 's something more .
- What ? What is it ?
- Last night there was no applause .
- There was .
That theater , half empty .
Dancing for those few .
I was frantic .
I finished , I waited , I listened ... but the applause did not come . Nothing .
They 're past , Pimenov . They 're dead .
It 's finished .
Meierheim .
Madame !
In negligée an hour before the performance .
What 's this , you 're canceling your car ?
Do you know the time , or are we all mad ?
Am I your manager ?
Have we contracts ? Have we obligations ?
- Is this the time , or I am blind ?
- I 'm canceling the engagement .
Madame is canceling the engagement ?
Madame has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke .
Tonight there is a line in front of the theater since 6 : 00 .
The house is jammed to the roof .
- Is it really full ?
- Doesn 't Meierheim say so ?
Packed to the ceiling .
And such an audience :
the French ambassador , American millionaires , Princess Retski ...
All right .
- Hurry , Suzette .
- We 'll wait outside .
Poor child .
- How is the house ?
- Terrible .
After this , no more ballets for me .
Jazz . Just jazz .
If the house is empty again ... .
I don 't know .
When she gets her paint on , hears the music , she 'll be fine .
I know these people .
Here she is .
Why did you bring the pearls ?
I said I won 't wear them .
- Why not ?
- Take them back .
- Hurry up .
- We haven 't time .
I don 't think I 'll be able to join you fellows after all .
- Why not ?
We 'll wait .
- Come on .
- Lift , please .
- Wait .
Can I help ?
You go ahead , old man .
I 'll be there if I 'm up for it .
- We 'll meet anyway .
- All right .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car is to be brought .
The car is here , Madame .
Hello .
Fifth floor .
Good evening .
It 's just 9 : 30 , madam .
Yes . I 'll send them up at once .
- Is he in ?
- The Baron ?
- Yes .
- Yes .
Adolphus , I have something very serious to discuss with you .
When you meet lady dogs on the street that are not dachshunds ... you must exercise some self-control .
We have company .
You 're late .
The dancer 's gone to the theater .
Excuse me , I 'm busy .
This is a very peculiar thing for one gentleman to say to another ... but as a matter of fact ... you 're the one thing in the world I really love .
She 's gone to the theater .
Don 't you know ?
- What are you going to do ?
- The pearls are in her room .
The others are getting suspicious .
I had Amsterdam on the phone .
They think you 're scared .
I 've been careful .
I 'm waiting my chance .
Waiting your chance ?
You 're too much of a gentleman , that 's the trouble .
I told you I 'd get those pearls tonight , didn 't I ?
- Need any help ?
- No .
Have you got the skeleton key ?
- No .
- Why not ?
One reason : there 's a perfectly charming floor clerk outside who sees everything .
She 'd see me enter her room .
- I can take care of her .
Chloroform on a handkerchief while you 're on the job .
- No .
- Why not ?
Poor kid .
In the first place , it would give her a rotten headache .
I know all about chloroform .
I had it in the war .
Besides , she 's rather pretty .
- She has a very nice line ...
- You 're no good for this business .
- No ?
- To you it 's just a joke .
I don 't like your tone .
- No ?
- No .
Get out .
Leave her to me .
Be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam .
- With the pearls .
- With the pearls .
Get out .
There is a nasty man , Adolphus .
He 'd eat his young .
" Both parties have fully agreed that this merger can only result ...
" in mutual advantages .
" Moreover ... . "
- Did you get that ?
- Yes , I got it .
What did you say Zinnowitz called you ?
Flaemmchen .
- Flaemm ?
That 's odd .
- What ?
I mean , who were the gentlemen you were talking to in the corridor ?
Some people I know .
- You know a lot of gentlemen , don 't you ?
- Oh , not many .
I haven 't time .
I 'm busy now looking for a job .
I 'd love to be in the movies .
Why the movies particularly ?
I mean ... .
" ... only in mutual advantages .
Moreover ... . "
You 're a very unusual stenographer .
You 're pretty enough to do other things .
- I do .
- What ?
You see , I have a rather nice figure , and I pose a lot .
Art studies , you know ?
Like that ?
I got 10 marks for it .
Is that you ?
You ?
Well , isn 't that interesting ?
- That 's lovely .
- " Moreover ... . "
" Moreover , the possibility of the successful accommodation ...
" for the Cotton Company ...
" should throw a great weight into the balance ... . "
" Balance . "
Your hands are sunburned , aren 't they ?
- Yes , that 's from skiing .
- From skiing ?
A friend of mine took me to Switzerland last month .
To Switzerland ?
That must have been very nice .
I went to Florence once , too .
- With the same man ?
- No .
Don 't misunderstand me , Miss Flaemm .
I 'm a married man and have grown-up daughters ...
- All right .
- ... bigger than you are .
Come in .
That 's all .
Excuse me , please .
" Deal with Manchester definitely off . " Is that something terrible ?
It doesn 't mean that at all .
- That 's a mistake .
That 's wrong .
- All right .
I 'm sorry .
- Do you want to go on ?
- No .
You come back in the morning ... and we will go on with the dictation before the conference .
If you find out you won 't need me in the morning ... I wish you 'd please let me know ... because men like you who come in and out of town are often unreliable .
After all , if I don 't work tomorrow ... .
Well , good night .
" Deal definitely off . "
Why , we could be smashed .
I 'm going into 170 now , madam .
Hello ?
No .
There 's no one here .
You 're late .
What have you been doing ?
Everyone says , " Come back . " They won 't get out of their rooms .
Housekeeper speaking .
No , she isn 't here .
- Western Theater ?
- Have you seen Madame ?
Hello .
Mr. Pimenov ?
Have you found her ?
No , she isn 't here .
Yes , I know ...
Pimenov ?
What 's happening ?
No , I haven 't found her .
Who 's dancing ?
Duprez ?
How was it ?
Good . All right .
You keep the show going .
This trick is going to cost Madame a suit for breach of contract .
- Madame is ill .
Her nerves ...
- What about my nerves ?
Who is she ?
Where does she think she is , Russia ?
- I want to be alone .
- Where have you been ?
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract .
I just want to be alone .
You 're going to be very much alone , my dear Madame .
This is the end .
- Shall I ... .
Does Madame wish ... .
- No , Suzette .
All right .
Western Theater , please .
Mr. Pimenov , the ballet master .
Grusinskaya .
Hello , Pimenov .
I 'm at the hotel .
I couldn 't go on .
I couldn 't .
How is it going ?
Who 's dancing ?
Duprez ?
Well , how is it ?
I see .
They didn 't miss me at all .
Good night , Pimenov .
They didn 't even miss me .
Yes .
I 'm sorry .
I 've finished .
Finished .
I always said I 'd leave off when the time came .
And who would trouble about a Grusinskaya ... who dances no more ?
What would she do ?
Grow orchids ?
Keep white peacocks ?
Die .
That 's what it comes to at last : to die .
I 'm not going to wait .
Don 't be alarmed , Madame .
Who are you ?
Someone who happened to be hiding in your room .
Why ?
I often come here when you 're at the theater .
Why ?
Just to be alone in your room , to breathe the air you breathe .
There 's no need to call for help .
Permit me .
I couldn 't help hearing .
I couldn 't help knowing what you were about to do just now .
I could have left by the window , unnoticed , but I risked being discovered .
May I say something , Madame ?
You 're so beautiful .
It tore my heart to see you in despair like that .
What on earth have they been doing to you ?
You 've everything to live for .
Please don 't cry anymore .
You must forgive me .
I 've had a very trying evening .
I was so alone , and suddenly you were there .
Why do you look at me like that ?
I had no idea you were so beautiful .
I 'd like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you , ever .
How tired you are .
Yes , tired .
And alone ?
So alone .
You mustn 't talk Russian to me .
Strange man .
Am I so strange to you ?
Maybe not so strange now .
You know , once , when the Grand Duke was alive ... I found a man hiding in my room , a young officer .
Later on , they found him dead .
Well , that was Russia .
- Who are you ?
- Someone who can love you , that 's all .
Someone who has forgotten everything else but you .
You could love me ?
I 've never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are .
You must go now .
I 'm not going .
You know I 'm not going .
Please let me stay .
But I want to be alone .
That isn 't true .
You don 't want to be alone .
You were in despair just now .
I can 't leave you now .
You mustn 't cry anymore .
You must forget .
Let me stay .
Just for a little while .
Please let me stay .
For just a minute , then .
No , Doctor .
The champagne , and those girls and their dancing ... those beautiful silver things , and the ice , and the caviar ... .
Oh , Doctor .
I don 't care .
It 's life .
Life .
Mr. Kringelein , you are drunk .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- No .
My room .
- Yes , Doctor .
Mr. Kringelein , you 're drunk .
Life .
Grand Hotel .
Hello ?
Grand Hotel .
Grand Hotel , good morning .
Baron von Geigern 's room does not answer .
Yes , all right .
Baron von Geigern 's chauffeur calling ?
Grand Hotel , good morning .
930 , Dr. Otternschlag .
No , Doctor .
No messages .
Grand Hotel , 820 .
Grand Hotel , good morning .
Who is calling Mme. Grusinskaya ?
Mr. Pimenov .
Mme. Grusinskaya cannot be disturbed .
Mr. Preysing 's calls to 162 for the day .
- 162 .
- The conference room .
That is interesting .
A man in the textile industry must know Manchester .
There 's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company .
They have the whole English market right in their hands .
Have you any connections with Manchester ?
We have a lot of good connections in England .
- Actually ...
- I mean , with the Manchester people .
Please , we are here to discuss the merger .
Let us begin at the beginning .
- Yes .
- Thank you .
Is Baron von Geigern in ?
Too bad .
Since June 11 this year , when the first negotiation ...
I met him yesterday .
... between our respective firms ...
I 've got a date .
... that this merger can result ... .
About 5 : 00 .
- ... all of us .
- Dancing .
- All we want to know about is Manchester .
- Just a second .
Before I get through , I 'm laying before you here ... the last general statement of the concern .
The capital , the plant , the machinery ... .
For instance , we 'll take mop rags .
- I 'll call you back .
- All we want to know about is Manchester .
Yes , Mr. Preysing , that 's what we want to know .
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz ... before I commit myself , please .
Now , to go ahead with the merger .
You realize ... that this merger is a great advantage to the Saxonians , of course .
Now , let 's talk like adults .
- When you first approached us ...
- We did not approach you .
This letter filed on September 15 indicates you approached us .
That letter is a response to a tentative feeler sent out by you .
- Please .
- Tentative , my foot !
A month before this , your old father-in-law ...
- comes to me privately , and scratches ...
- Scratched ?
- Why , we did not take the initiative !
- You did ...
- We did not take the initiative !
- You took the initiative !
Gentlemen , I see the conference has already begun .
- I 'm glad you 're here , Justice Zinnowitz .
- Good morning .
- Thank you very much .
- I beg your pardon , please .
Excuse me , please .
I am glad you 're here .
These gentlemen have cross words .
Would you try , Justice Zinnowitz ...
- and iron out the situation here ?
- Certainly .
- Right here , on the top .
- If you will allow me .
Thank you .
Well , gentlemen , the situation seems to be perfectly clear .
- Yes .
And how clear is Manchester ?
- Manchester ?
Have you said anything about Manchester , Mr. Preysing ?
Why , no , sir .
I cannot commit myself at this time about Manchester .
Quite right .
Well , gentlemen , since June 11 of this year ... when the first negotiations for a merger were entered ...
Now we 're going to begin at the beginning again .
As you remember it , when you approached us ...
- We did not approach you .
- I 'm sorry , you did approach us !
We did not approach you .
- You approached us !
- Please wait .
Can you imagine 100 girls in a ballet school ... each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in the world ?
I was ambitious then .
We were drilled like little soldiers .
No rest , no stopping .
I was little , slim , but hard as a diamond .
Then I became famous soon .
But why am I telling you all this ?
Last night I didn 't know you at all .
- Who are you , really ?
- What ?
I don 't even know your name .
I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern .
My mother called me Flix .
No .
Flix .
That 's sweet .
And how do you live ?
What kind of person are you ?
I 'm a prodigal son , the black sheep of a white flock .
I shall die on the gallows .
- Really ?
- Really .
I haven 't a bit of character .
None at all .
- No ?
- No .
Really .
You know , when I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman .
Then at school , to pray and lie .
And then in the war , to kill and hide .
That 's all .
And what do you do now ?
Now I 'm a gambler ... running at large , like a happy pig ... devouring everything of life that pleases me .
I really belong in jail .
What a picture .
And what else ?
What else ?
I 'm also a criminal and a hotel thief .
That 's not a funny joke .
You must believe one thing .
You must believe that I love you .
That I 've never known love like this until now .
What is it , Flix ?
What 's the matter ?
Hotel thief .
No .
Did you come here just for these ?
That 's horrible .
You may keep the pearls .
I don 't want them .
I will not denounce you .
Hadn 't you better go now ?
I wanted money desperately .
Can 't you understand that ?
That 's why I wanted your pearls .
I was threatened .
I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money .
I 've been following you .
I 've admired you .
But last night , at last , I managed to come into your room .
And now ... .
And now ?
I couldn 't go through with it .
Don 't you understand ?
Don 't you ?
- Who ?
- Suzette , Madame .
- Good morning .
- Good morning , Madame .
- Did Madame sleep well ?
- Yes , Suzette .
Come back in five minutes .
I 'll call you .
Five minutes .
There , it begins .
Hello , Pimenov .
Good morning .
Darling .
Beautiful morning .
Yes , very well .
Rehearsals ?
All right , you can come .
Goodbye .
I have to go to rehearsals .
Our train leaves early tomorrow morning .
- Our train ?
- Yes , for Vienna .
- Vienna ?
- You 're coming with me .
- Of course you are .
- But I can 't .
I 'd give my soul to go , but I can 't .
- Why couldn 't you ?
- I 'll try .
There might be some way .
- Flix , is it money ?
- Of course .
I have money .
I have enough for both of us .
No .
That would spoil everything .
I 'll manage somehow .
I 'll get it .
I have a whole day .
I 'll be on the train .
I shall dance , and you 'll be with me .
Then we 'll go to Tremezzo .
I have a villa there .
The sun will shine .
I 'll take a vacation , six weeks , eight weeks .
I don 't know .
We 'll be happy and lazy .
And then we 'll go to South America .
It will be divine .
- Be careful going to your room .
- I 'll be on the train with the money .
Don 't do anything foolish .
- I 'm alarmed about you .
- Don 't worry .
I 'll be on the train .
Hurry , Suzette .
A bright dress .
It 's a sunny morning .
Meierheim is canceling the Vienna engagement .
Meierheim is mad .
You are mad .
We 're all mad .
Suzette , come .
Gru , you 're positively radiant .
Pimenov , I have an idea , a ballet .
It must have mad music ... .
But I 'll speak with you later .
You go to the theater .
I want a full rehearsal , ballet , full orchestra ... .
- Come , Suzette .
- But , Madame ... .
Will you get me Baron von Geigern , please ?
Yes .
Baron von Geigern .
Chéri , it 's you .
No , nothing .
Good morning .
No .
Just to tell you that I 'm happy .
I 'll have something sweet and cold , please .
- Louisiana Flip , sir ?
- Louisiana Flip ?
Yes , that sounds very nice .
Thank you .
What do you do in the Grand Hotel ?
Eat , sleep , loaf around ... flirt a little , dance a little .
A hundred doors leading to one hall .
No one knows anything about the person next to them .
And when you leave , someone occupies your room ... lies in your bed .
That 's the end .
Let me say again , for the tenth time ... you people were quite ready for the merger .
You declared yourself fully agreed on all the terms .
Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up ?
I 'll admit that we were at one time anxious for this merger .
But since then , the Preysing Company has fallen on evil days .
- Evil days ?
- Very evil days .
Say , listen .
Haven 't I just shown you here ... what my firm exports to the Balkans ?
50,000 marks worth of mop rags each and every year .
Mop rags .
We 're interested in something entirely different .
- What ?
- Shall I tell them again ?
Why waste time ?
It 's getting late .
- You see ...
- We 're going home .
But Mr. Preysing has too great a regard for the certainty ...
You 've been talking all day .
You 're hoarse now .
Good night , Preysing .
You have decided against the merger ?
- Yes .
- The deal is off ?
Yes .
- Here 's your coat , sir .
- Thank you .
- Here , let me help you .
- Thank you .
Preysing , I hope you pull through .
It 's a very bad time to be in such a crisis .
Sorry .
- Dining in town ?
- No , I have to get my train .
Here !
So you 're breaking off the negotiations .
All right .
But don 't you think for one moment that I 'm such a fool ... as not to have something to say about Manchester .
What ?
Manchester ?
No .
The deal is over .
Good night , gentlemen .
If you have something definite to say about Manchester , we might ...
I 'm at liberty to announce at this time that the deal between my firm ... and the Manchester Cotton Company ... has been successfully negotiated .
Are you joking ?
Under those circumstances ... .
- Where are those articles ?
- I thought it was all over .
Under these circumstances , it 's a different matter .
Yes , but under these circumstances we might refuse to sign now .
Now , come , come .
Business is business .
Now , I 'll sign in here .
Preysing , you sign here .
We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine .
Good night .
We 'll see you next week and settle all the details .
- Next week .
Yes .
- Come on .
Good night , Preysing .
You 're a sly one .
- Dr. Waitz ?
- Yes .
I 'll be at your office tomorrow .
You let me talk myself hoarse ... and you had Manchester signed up all the time . Why ?
- The deal has been put through .
- Yeah .
The deal has been put through .
- What 's the matter with you ?
" Deal with Manchester definitely ...
" definitely off . " Preysing !
Yes , if that 's what the world wants , bluff ...
I can be just as big a bluff as anyone .
You must go to England yourself at once and really see this through !
Yes , I must go to England .
I was desperate .
I didn 't know what I was doing .
Now I don 't care .
This thing goes to a man 's head .
- What you need is some relaxation .
- Yeah !
That 's it !
I want to break loose .
I want to drink .
I want to maybe go dancing .
I want to do anything .
I can understand that , after this ... . Yes , go on , say it .
My lie .
But that 's the first time in 30 years that ... .
Where is my stenographer ?
Miss Flaemm ?
- What do you want with her ?
- Pardon ?
- What do you want ?
- What ?
Here .
I want to do some dictating .
I want to tell my father-in-law about ...
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at 5 : 00 .
She was in a hurry .
- In the Yellow Room ?
- Yes .
Do you think that she 's pretty ?
- Pretty as a picture .
- You think so ?
Let 's go find her .
We 'll go get a drink .
- You come along , Zinnowitz .
- Yes .
I don 't know much about women .
I 've been married for 28 years , you know .
Come along , Zinnowitz .
- Good evening , Mr. Kringelein .
- Good evening , Miss Flaemm .
- Have you seen the Baron ?
- I 'm waiting for him .
I 've been with him all day .
We had a marvelous time .
We were in a motor car , 100 miles an hour , in an airplane .
- Really ?
- We had a marvelous time .
My , how you 've changed .
You look awfully nice .
Thank you , Miss Flaemm .
I had a manicure , too .
Really ?
I 'm sorry , Miss Flaemm .
Would you have something to drink ?
A Louisiana Flip . Louisiana Flip , please .
- Absinthe .
- Oh , that .
- You like music , Mr. Kringelein ?
- Yes .
I love it .
It 's so stimulating .
- A man could ... - A man could what ?
- He could do almost anything .
- He could .
- Hello , funny one .
- Hello .
- Sorry I 'm late .
- Baron , won 't you have a drink ?
- A Louisiana Flip .
- Mr. Kringelein , how are you now ?
I feel a little strange , Baron .
- I 'd given you up .
- Sorry .
Please , Baron , do have a drink .
A Louisiana Flip .
No , thanks , old man .
I 'm keeping my head clear .
- Dance , then ?
- What ?
- Dance ?
- Yes , I 'd love to .
- Watch this , will you , Mr. Kringelein ?
- I really ought to learn to dance .
I suppose it 's very important .
Yes , you should learn as quickly as the time allows .
Believe me , Mr. Kringelein , a man who is not with a woman ... is a dead man .
- What have you been doing all day ?
- Chasing around .
- Chasing what ?
- Money .
- You were very different yesterday .
- That was yesterday .
I served as a surgeon in the Great War ... till the end .
Grenade in my face .
I carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound till 1920 .
Isolated two years .
- Drink , Mr. Kringelein .
- Yes .
That was lovely .
Listen , funny one , do you want to make a man happy ?
- I 'd love to .
- Dance with old Kringelein .
Why ?
I don 't know .
He 's a dear old duck .
I feel rather sorry for him , don 't you ?
You know , you 're not a bit like you were yesterday .
Yesterday ?
No , perhaps not .
I fell in love last night .
The real thing .
There 's no real thing .
It just doesn 't exist .
I thought that , too .
But now I know that it does .
It 's wonderful .
Come along .
- Dance with old Kringelein ?
- Of course .
Anything for you .
You 're sweet .
Here you are .
I must speak with you .
- Presently , Mr. Preysing .
- No , now .
This is very urgent .
This lady has urgent business with me at the moment .
Insolence .
Berlin manners .
Good evening , Mr. Preysing .
You 're staying here , too ?
- I 'm sorry , but I cannot place you .
- Kringelein , at the plant .
One of our agents .
No .
Assistant bookkeeper , Room 23 , Building C , third floor .
- I am away , sick .
- That 's very interesting .
Good day .
Would you like to dance with me , Mr. Kringelein ?
Miss Flaemm , I 've never danced in public .
- Come along and try it .
- I 'd be afraid .
There 's nothing to be afraid of .
You 'll love it .
Miss Flaemmchen , I must speak to you .
This is about a dictating job .
- When do we start ?
Tomorrow morning ?
- No , right now .
We were just going to dance .
Do you know each other ?
Mr. Kringelein , Mr. Preysing .
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance .
I couldn 't think of not accepting the invitation to dance .
I understood you to say that you reported to our plant ill ... and you 're here in Berlin indulging in diversions ... which are very much beyond your means ?
This is very extraordinary , Mr. Kringelein .
I think we should look over your books .
Come along now , children . No fighting .
Save that for the office .
Does the world belong to you , Mr. Preysing ?
Haven 't I got any right to live ?
I will wait 10 minutes for you .
If you 're not back , it will be necessary to engage someone else .
What happened to your dance ?
We 're going now , thank you , Baron .
Come along .
I shall remember this , Mr. Kringelein .
Let the poor devil alone .
Death 's staring him in the face .
I did not ask your advice .
I think you 'd better go away .
We will see who will remain here the longer .
Baron von Geigern , please .
Mr. Kringelein , you must look at my face , and not the floor .
Yes .
- Why , you 're trembling .
- I never danced in public before .
- You dance beautifully .
- Thank you .
- That 's right .
- I 'm happy , Miss Flaemm .
Are you really ?
For the first time in my life , I 'm happy .
Are you all right ?
Yes .
Excuse me , I just stopped a second .
All right .
Here we go .
I 'm very tired .
Do you mind if we stop ?
Thank you .
- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now .
- Must you ?
Yes , business .
One has to earn a living , you know .
Not you , Miss Flaemm .
Just another desk slave .
Money .
- I 'm glad you 're here , Miss Flaemm .
- Here I am .
- Did you enjoy your dance ?
- Yes , thank you .
- Excuse me .
Go away , please .
- Where 's the Louisiana Flip ?
- Would you like a little cognac ?
- Yes .
You wanted to see me ?
Yes .
You may go , Mr. Kringelein .
Mr. Preysing , I am not taking orders from you here .
What is this insolence ?
Please go away .
You think you have free license to be insulting ?
Believe me , you have not .
You think you 're superior , but you 're quite an ordinary man ... even if you did marry money ... and people like me have got to slave for you ... for 320 marks a month .
- Go away , please .
You are annoying .
- You don 't like to see me enjoying myself .
When a man 's working himself to death , that 's what he 's paid for .
You don 't care if a man can live on his wages or not .
You have a very regular scale of wages , and there 's the sick fund for you .
What a scale , and what a fund .
When I was sick for four weeks ... you wrote me a letter telling me I 'd be discharged ... if I were sick any longer .
Did you write me that letter or not ?
I have no idea of the letters that I write .
I know that you are here in the Grand Hotel , living like a lord .
You are probably an embezzler .
- An embezzler !
- Yes , an embezzler .
You are going to take that back !
Right here in the presence of this young lady !
Who do you think you 're talking to ?
You think I 'm dirt ?
If I 'm dirt , you 're a lot dirtier ...
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing !
- You 're discharged .
Get out !
- You can 't do that to him .
I don 't know the man or what he wants .
I never saw him before .
I know you .
I 've kept your books for you , and I know all about you .
If one of your employees was half as stupid in a small way ...
- as you are in a big way ...
- What do you mean ?
Gentlemen , please !
Please !
Stop that !
- You 're discharged !
Do you hear ?
- Wait !
You can 't discharge me .
I 'm my own master ... for the first time in my life .
You can 't discharge me .
I 'm sick .
I 'm going to die .
You understand ?
I 'm going to die , and nobody can do anything to me anymore .
Nothing can happen to me anymore .
Before I can be discharged , I 'll be dead !
The man 's crazy .
I don 't know him .
He 's annoying .
- Baron !
- Excuse me .
- What is it ?
What 's happened to him ?
- He 's ill .
- I 'm sorry , Baron .
- Poor old Kringelein .
You 're all right .
- Give him some whiskey .
- No .
A Louisiana Flip .
Five minutes to 7 : 00 .
Time drags when you 're tired .
I was in the hospital the whole night , walking up and down the corridor .
They wouldn 't let me see her .
And I have to stay chained to this desk .
Did you find that young lady for Mr. Preysing ?
- His secretary .
Yes , they 're over there .
- That 's all .
His secretary .
Come on , waiter .
- Would you like a little cognac ?
- No , nothing .
Nothing ?
- One cognac for me .
- Very good , sir .
You wanted to see me ?
Yes .
Pardon me .
I must go to England .
It 's very important .
I must go at once .
I have some very big deals ... involving hundreds of thousands of marks ... and I thought I would take along a secretary ... to take care of my correspondence .
You know what I mean .
I understood you to say that you traveled and ... .
You understand ?
I understand you perfectly , Mr. Preysing .
What would you want for such a trip ?
- Marks ?
You mean money ?
- Yes .
I don 't know .
I 'd have to figure it up .
I 'd need clothes and shoes ... and it 's cold in England in March .
- You 'd want me to look nice ?
- Of course , Miss Flaemm .
Yes , I thought you would .
I should say 1,000 marks .
- Is that too much ?
- No .
That is all right .
Would you like me to get you a room here ... at the hotel ?
Now ?
- And that would ...
- Hello , Baron .
- Would you please pay some attention ?
- I 'm paying attention .
- How do you do ?
- Insolence .
You mean the Baron ?
- Baron what ?
- What ?
He 's a gentleman .
Is the Baron tired ?
No , not tired exactly .
I thought this evening we could go to the casino .
That place we passed with the wonderful bright lights .
Kringelein , I 'd adore it .
I can 't go anywhere .
- What ?
- I 'm broke .
- No , you 're joking .
- Yes . Isn 't it odd ?
A baron , broke .
Excuse me , old man .
- I quit .
- You can 't .
I 'm not getting those pearls , neither are you .
- What about the money ?
- I 'll pay you back .
- How ?
- I have an idea working in my head .
You might find a bullet through that head .
If you do that you 'll get nothing , except maybe the police after you .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car !
If you wait , I 'll pay you back your 5,000 ...
I 'll see you later .
Go on , Suzette .
Are you coming to the theater ?
I shall dance tonight .
How I shall dance !
I want to feel that you 're there .
I came too far .
- I 'm worried about you .
- Don 't be .
- You 'll be on the train ?
- Yes .
- Until then .
- Bless you .
- Was the Baron joking ?
- What ?
- Is it really true ?
- What are you talking about , Kringelein ?
Is the Baron really in financial straits ?
To tell you the truth , I must get some money somehow right away .
- If the Baron will permit me .
- What ?
I 'd be awfully glad to oblige .
You 've been very decent to me .
Three hundred ?
If I could get into a game of some kind , I think I might win .
Gambling !
I 'd love that !
I 've got over 6,800 marks right here .
If we could scare up some men to play .
- We could go up to my room .
- That 's a grand idea .
Come on .
- Cab , miss ?
- What ?
- Cab ?
- No , thanks .
I 'll walk .
- 4,000 marks .
- 4,000 !
Too high ?
4,000 marks .
- Want a card ?
- Please .
Thanks .
- 8,000 marks .
- 8,000 !
- I take it all .
- That 's a lot of money .
I need it , thanks .
- Want a card ?
- Please .
Baccarat .
Too bad there .
- Now , Mr. Kringelein .
- Baron !
Will you help me again , please ?
I think you 'd better help me , Kringelein .
- Make your bets , gentlemen .
- How much shall I bet ?
- How much is left in the bank ?
- 2,500 uncovered .
- Do you feel like going that far ?
- All that money , Baron ?
Come on , you 're killing them tonight .
Go ahead , old man .
Do you want a card ?
What have you got ?
The old highwayman .
He has nine again .
I win again !
Come on , gentlemen .
Please drink ! Drink .
It 's wonderful and sweet champagne !
Mr. Kringelein , care to take the bank ?
Yes !
Surely .
I 'll take everything .
I 'll take anything .
Come on , now .
Drink , gentlemen .
Please drink some champagne .
It 's expensive and good .
What will I take the bank for ?
- I 'll play for 500 .
- Baron , all at once ?
Suppose you lose it ?
It 's all the same thing , Kringelein .
Come on , now , old man .
Deal me two cards .
One to me first .
One to yourself .
One to me .
One to yourself .
Baron , if all that money ... .
What have you got ?
I 've got a nine !
Isn 't that a wonderful thing ?
Kringelein , you old robber , you 're hopeless .
Baron !
Baron , please .
It 's no use , old man .
It 's sweet of you ...
- but you have all the luck .
- It 's true .
I have luck , for the first time in my life !
I have luck !
Baron , are you out ?
Have you finished playing ?
Yes , thank you .
I 'll recover again presently , in 10 or 20 years .
Look , Doctor .
I 've won again !
There you are .
Baron , I win and drink , and drink and win !
Gentlemen , please don 't go .
Be my guests . Don 't go .
I beg your pardon .
I know I oughtn 't to presume , but I 'm so grateful to you .
It 's been so marvelous .
For the first time in my life , I 've gambled and I 've danced .
You gentlemen can laugh ... but for the first time in my life , I 've tasted life !
- Splendid !
- Life is wonderful , but it 's very dangerous .
If you have the courage to live it , it 's marvelous .
- Wonderful !
- You don 't know about that .
You 're healthy and happy .
But I , believe me ... if a man doesn 't know death , he doesn 't know life .
- It 's a short life , but a gay one .
- Please , gentlemen , don 't go .
Come on .
Drink to life ... to the magnificent , dangerous ... brief , wonderful life .
- Kringelein !
- And the courage to live it .
You know , I 've only lived since last night ... but that little while seems longer than all the time that 's gone before .
All of ... .
Take him over to his bed .
Turn him around .
How is he , Doctor ?
- It will be over in a minute .
- Over ?
- It 's only just begun .
- Quiet , Kringelein .
Don 't be afraid .
I 'm not afraid , Doc .
- I 'm not afraid to die .
- There , there .
You 'll be all right .
Too much iced champagne .
- What ?
- Hello , Baron .
Hello , Kringelein .
You old drunkard .
It 's late .
- What is it ?
- My pocketbook .
I 've lost my pocketbook .
14,000 marks in that pocketbook .
- I 've got to find it .
- No , stay where you are .
No , I 've got to find that .
- Kringelein !
- 14,000 marks .
14,000 marks were in that pocketbook .
I can 't see anything .
You don 't know what that money means to a man like me .
You 've never lived like a dog in a hole ... and scrimped and saved .
You did not see his pocketbook , did you , Baron ?
No .
My life hangs on that money , Baron .
Nobody ever gives you anything for nothing .
You have to buy everything , and pay cash for it .
I wanted to pay for my last days with that money .
I must find it !
I haven 't anything in the world but that pocketbook !
Every hour costs money .
I must find it !
Here 's your pocketbook , you silly old thing .
- There 's your money .
- You found it !
That 's it .
You found it .
I 'm very glad he got it back . 14,000 marks .
Yes .
It 's a lot of money , isn 't it ?
- Good night , Kringelein .
- Don 't go , Baron .
Don 't leave me .
- I must , old man .
It 's late , I 'm sorry .
- No .
Please don 't go !
I must , old man .
It 's late .
Good night .
Good night , Kringelein .
Stay a while , Baron .
I 'm sorry .
I can 't , old man .
I have no time .
Wait a minute .
- Hello , funny one .
- Hello .
What are you doing here at this time ?
Looking for my room . 164 .
- Do you live here ?
- Yes , for tonight .
Such is life , Flaemmchen .
You 're nice .
Good night ... funny one .
Good night .
Come on .
- Thank you , madam .
Good night .
- Good night .
You were superb tonight .
What a success !
Yes .
It was a triumph , wasn 't it ?
Madame will return to Berlin soon ?
Who knows , monsieur ?
Do be sensible .
Shall I come and talk about the music now , or not ?
No .
Not tonight .
Pimenov , go and find him .
- Flaemmchen .
- Hello .
I 've been waiting in there for you .
I had to arrange about the trip .
- You 're very sweet .
- Thank you .
Won 't you sit down ?
You know , you are entirely different from what I expected .
- Different ?
How ? - I don 't know .
I thought you were more of a coquette ... not so ladylike .
What did you expect ?
Wouldn 't you like to call me by the first name ?
No , I couldn 't do that .
- Why not ?
- I don 't know .
One can 't get intimate just offhand .
I could go to England with you and all that , but ... .
I always say that nothing should be left hanging over .
And names are like that .
Supposing I met you next year and I said :
" How do you do , Mr. Preysing . "
And you said , " That 's the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester . "
That 's all quite proper .
But supposing I saw you and yelled :
" Hi , baby !
Remember Manchester ? "
And you were with your wife .
How would you like that ?
We will leave my wife out of this , Flaemmchen , please .
- Sorry .
- I didn 't mean that .
You are very slender , aren 't you ?
- Think so ?
- Are you going to be nice to me ?
Yes .
- Very nice ?
- That 's what you expect , isn 't it ?
You like me just a little bit , don 't you ?
You 're still a stranger to me , but that doesn 't matter .
It 's you , Baron .
What are you doing in this room here ?
- This your room , Preysing ?
- Yes , this is my room .
Sorry .
I must 've made a mistake .
We shall see whether you made a mistake or not .
That door is locked , Baron .
Yes .
I came through here .
Here .
I want that pocketbook .
- What do you mean ?
- I want that pocketbook .
Give it to me !
- Certainly .
- So that 's how we stand , Baron .
Look here , Preysing ... I 'm completely at your mercy .
I was desperate .
It 's a matter of life and death .
I had to get some money tonight , somehow .
Yes , you did have to get some money tonight ... but you 're going to jail .
You 're going to be locked up .
- Why , you 're a thief !
- Be quiet .
Quiet ?
Yeah , quiet !
You danced with Flaemmchen when I wanted to transact business with her .
You , the nice friend of the nice Mr. Kringelein .
- Do you want to wake up the entire hotel ?
- I will wake up the hotel !
I 'll show them what a baron you are .
You are a thief !
I 'll have you locked up .
Here , you wait here .
Thief !
You !
Strike me , would you ?
Hello .
Operator .
Operator .
They 're having a nice little game up there with that telephone .
Oh , God .
Baron !
Speak to me !
Baron .
He tried to rob me .
He 's a thief .
Here , Miss Flaemm .
Miss Flaemm , please don 't leave me .
Please , Miss Flaemm .
- Look !
- What a grand hotel !
- Hurry up .
They 're waiting .
- She was in a hurry .
No wonder she was running .
Mr. Kringelein !
Wake up !
Hear me ?
Wake up !
- The Baron .
- The Baron ?
Go quickly .
The Baron .
Do you hear me ?
- Where ?
- Preysing 's room .
Hurry !
Here .
Take it .
You thief , you .
I must get out of here .
Mr. Kringelein , he robbed me .
He struck me .
He 's dead .
Baron .
Dead , just like that .
Look .
His eyes are still open .
He looks so peaceful .
It can 't be so hard to die .
That pocketbook he stole from me .
It 's just like it was .
I haven 't touched nothing .
Maybe he did try to take your pocketbook ... but you don 't kill a man for that .
You don 't kill a man about a pocketbook .
Poor Baron , he wanted money so badly .
- Where is Miss Flaemm ?
- I 'll take care of her .
That 's it .
She 's working with that man .
She enticed me into her room while he robbed me here .
- I 'll tell that to the court .
- To the court ?
Yes .
Mr. Kringelein , I must talk with you before the police come .
Miss Flaemm is in your room ?
- Yes .
- She 's in your room .
No one will know that I was with her .
You were with her .
They will not interrogate you .
They will not ask you any questions .
You cannot give no testimony .
Neither can she say anything .
But what you are proposing is falsification of the evidence .
My existence is hanging by a thread .
A scandal with that woman would mean ruin for me .
- But you 've just killed a man !
- That makes no difference !
I beg your pardon . It makes all the difference in the world .
- We 're going to call the police .
- No !
Please , Mr. Kringelein .
I will give you money , anything .
You can go away .
Please .
- I have enough money .
- Mr. Kringelein , please help me .
- My life is in your hands .
- Your life .
What about my life , when you had it in your hands ?
But I can send you back to Friedersdorf .
I can give you a very good position in Friedersdorf .
Many , many thanks , Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing ...
- but I am never going back to Friedersdorf .
- Don 't , please .
Worry about yourself .
Don 't worry about me .
No , Mr. Kringelein , please don 't call ...
Hello !
There 's been a murder here .
I don 't understand you .
- They 're drinking .
- What ?
Yes .
What is it ?
Is this a joke ?
Hello .
Hurry up .
Someone in 166 says there 's been a murder .
166 ?
Preysing ?
I 'll attend to it .
- What time is it , Suzette ?
- It 's 3 : 00 in the morning , Madame .
Tired , Suzette ?
- Is Madame not tired ?
- No , Suzette .
- Madame has changed her dress again .
- Yes , Suzette .
The music has stopped .
How quiet it is tonight .
It was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel .
Those flowers make me think of funerals .
- Don 't they you , Suzette ?
- It 's just nerves , Madame , nerves .
Suzette , we 're going to take a holiday soon .
Six weeks in Tremezzo .
I 'm going to live like a real woman ... perfectly simple , perfectly quiet , perfectly happy .
- Yes , Madame .
- We 'll have a guest .
Certainly , Madame .
But Madame must sleep now .
The train will soon go .
I suppose so .
Call Baron von Geigern 's room , please .
Keep ringing .
He must be asleep .
Come and fetch me , chéri ... I 'm longing for you .
I haven 't been asleep .
I kept thinking that you might come to me .
But he must answer .
Ring !
Why don 't you answer the phone , please ?
Yes .
Yes .
Ring .
Where are you ?
Thirty-four !
Thirty-six .
Thirty-eight .
Forty .
- Forty-two .
- Let 's go to work , boys .
Forty-four .
Forty-four , forty-six pounds .
Forty-eight .
- Are these things necessary ?
- I 'm afraid so , Mr. Preysing .
All right .
We 've taken care of all that , Mr. Preysing .
The night porter 's gone .
You 're late .
I was at the clinic the whole night .
- My wife , poor girl .
- The child hasn 't come yet ?
No .
But I mustn 't let it interfere with my duty .
- You won 't forget that ?
- No , sir .
- I 'm going now .
- Yes , Doctor .
- What 's this ?
- A killing in 166 .
Killing ?
Who ?
The big manufacturer Preysing killed Baron von Geigern .
Good heavens !
What for ?
- I don 't know .
- That 's terrible !
- He was a nice fellow .
- They say he was a thief .
I don 't believe it .
He was a real gentleman .
I know people .
I 'm so tired I can 't hardly see out of my eyes .
No sleep for two nights , here all day , and now this killing at the hotel .
Halt !
Front !
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
Show your hands .
Hands . Over .
- Change those gloves .
- Yes , sir .
- Down .
- Dismissed .
Too bad about the Baron .
You always felt better when he came along .
- Always friendly , such an agreeable fellow .
- I 'll tell you a funny thing about ...
Be quiet .
Good morning , madam .
Where are you taking that dog ?
- Baron von Geigern .
- Give it to me .
Better take charge of this dog .
It belonged to the Baron .
Yes , sir .
- They have taken him away ?
- Yes . Wasn 't it terrible ?
Madame must not know .
You understand ?
Madame must not know !
All right , I can tell it to the maids , but I can 't answer for downstairs .
- Are you all right , Miss Flaemmchen ?
- Yes .
I was just thinking about the Baron .
Lying there , with his eyes so open .
You loved the Baron , didn 't you ?
So did I.
He was friendly to me as no man ever was .
What if he was a burglar ?
- They don 't kill a man for that .
- He was desperate .
He was ?
He tried to raise money all day .
And he laughed , poor devil .
And a man like Preysing has to kill him .
You know , I didn 't like Preysing right off .
Why did you have anything to do with him ?
- Money .
- Money .
- You don 't understand that , do you ?
- Yes , I do .
- Do you really ?
- Yes , I do .
I could take care of you , Miss Flaemmchen , if you 'd let me .
I have enough money .
There 's 10,200 marks in this pocketbook ... and there 's 3,400 that I won last night .
That would last a long time .
I could win some more .
We could travel .
- Travel ?
- Yes , to Paris .
- I 've always wanted to go to Paris .
- Anywhere you like .
Here .
I 'll give you this money I won last night . 3,400 ...
- and then later you can have some more .
- Later ?
Yes , when I ... .
I 'm ill , Flaemmchen .
I won 't live long .
Will you stay with me ?
That 's nonsense !
We 'll find a great doctor .
He 'll cure you .
- They can cure anything these days .
- You think so ?
Of course .
You 'll see .
Here .
Do you think you 'd have as good a time with me ... as you did with Preysing ?
- Why , of course .
- Really ?
- Yes .
- You like me better than you did him ?
You 're a good man , Mr. Kringelein .
A very good man .
You know , I never thought anything so beautiful could come to me .
We 'll catch the first train to Paris .
Order two tickets now .
Come on .
I can 't .
Hello , porter ?
Yes , please .
I 'd like two tickets to Paris .
Yes .
What time does the next train leave ?
Pimenov .
- He 'll be on the train .
- But how do you know ?
Baron von Geigern has left ?
When ?
How long ago ?
The Baron left about half an hour ago .
Gru , come , come .
We 'll lose the train .
Come along .
Here you are , sir .
I 'm sorry .
Mme. Grusinskaya 's car .
Come along , the train will be going .
- What is it , Gru ?
- Please come , madam , please .
- I 'll ask myself .
- What is the use of asking ?
- He 'll be on the train .
He 'll be there .
- Have you seen Baron von Geigern ?
The Baron is not here , madam .
- Has he gone ?
- Yes , madam .
- We haven 't any time to waste .
- He 'll be on the train .
We have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow .
The sun .
It 'll be sunny in Tremezzo .
We 'll have a guest , Suzette .
Yes ?
Grand Hotel !
The Grand Hotel , sweetheart .
This way , precious .
Take the car to the garage .
Take the bags in , please .
Come , darling .
Good morning .
- Will you kindly register ?
- Certainly .
- Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman .
- Head porter 's desk .
Mr. Senf ?
Just a moment .
Hospital .
Hello .
Yes , head porter .
Yes .
What ?
- Yes .
- What 's the matter ?
The child has come .
It 's a boy .
- And your wife ?
- My wife is well .
Hello .
Hospital ?
I 'll be with you on lunch hour .
These rooms are not taken .
176 , 170 , 168 , 166 .
- Is Your Excellency leaving ?
- A cab , please .
- A cab for His Excellency .
- My bill , and the lady 's , too .
- Have you got your tickets ?
- My tickets .
- Tickets for Mr. Kringelein .
- Thank you .
Your forwarding address ?
The Grand Hotel , in Paris .
How do you know there will be one ?
There 's a Grand Hotel everywhere in the world .
- Goodbye , Mr. Kringelein .
- Goodbye , Doctor .
Pain 's gone already ?
Pain .
I have none , Doctor .
Goodbye .
My luggage .
- Telegram .
- I beg your pardon .
Where 's the money ?
Hurry . We 'll miss that train .
Got your bags now ? Come along .
Here you are .
- Come on .
- Goodbye , Your Excellency .
- Goodbye !
- Your hat , sir .
Goodbye .
I 'm coming .
Please be careful of that .
Friedrichstrasse Station .
Grand Hotel .
Always the same .
People come , people go .
Nothing ever happens .

Hey , pipe down , you mugs .
Sorry to break up the game , boys ... but the old man 's having bunk inspection in an hour .
Give me my bones !
This man 's army ain 't been nothing but just one inspection after another .
If ever I get back to Texas on that range again ... the first man who says " inspection " to me ... he 's going to be S.O.L. , because he 'll hear from my six-shooter .
There 'll be no inspection where I 'm going .
Where 's that ?
Why , back into vaudeville with my old lion-taming act !
I wonder if Oscar and Minnie will know me when I step back into the cage .
You better hope they do .
I know what I 'm gonna do .
Get me some kind of construction job .
I didn 't know that was your line , Sergeant .
It wasn 't , but it 's going to be .
Being in the Engineering Corps has been swell experience ... and I 'm making the most of it .
Well , we 'll be reading about you in the newspapers , I 'll bet .
" Mr. James Allen is building a new Panama Canal . " Or something .
You can bet your tin hat Mr. James Allen won 't be back in the old grind of a factory .
Do you think he 'll be wearing his medal ?
Why , of course he will .
- Mom !
- Jim !
It 's good to have you back .
You 're a little thinner , Jim .
Your cooking will fix that up .
Clint !
Well , you haven 't changed a bit .
But , Alice , I wouldn 't have known you .
She 's grown up , hasn 't she ?
She certainly has .
And you look different , too .
I think it 's the uniform I miss .
It made you look taller and more distinguished .
I got a regular welcome-home party here , haven 't I ?
Mr. Parker , it 's nice of you to be here .
You have a lot to thank Mr. Parker for .
That 's nothing .
He feels after all you 've been through , we owe you something .
Mr. Parker is going to take you back into the factory .
I 've saved your old job for you . You 've done your bit and your boss isn 't going to forget you .
Well , I have- -
I 'm so glad to have you back .
I guess we 'd better go home , don 't you think ?
All right , I 'll take this .
I 'll see you later , Jim .
Goodbye .
The old place hasn 't changed a bit .
Well , let 's sit down and have a talk .
Tell us all about the war .
I won 't live that long .
What did you think of Mr. Parker being at the station ?
Say , Clint . Speaking of Mr. Parker , will you do something for me ?
Sure .
What is it ?
Well , will you talk to him for me and tell him I 'm not going to take that job ?
And why should I tell him that ?
It 's kind of hard to explain .
But you see , the Army changes a fellow .
It kind of makes you think different .
I don 't want to spend the rest of my life ... answering a factory whistle , instead of a bugle call ... or be cooped up in a shipping room all day .
I want to do something worthwhile .
Jim , how can you talk like that ?
He 's tired , Mother . Excited .
You don 't know what you are saying .
But tomorrow morning , after a good night 's sleep ... you 'll be ready to take up where you left off at the factory .
A soldier of peace instead of a soldier of war .
I don 't want to be a soldier of anything .
You see , Mom ...
I want to get out .
Away from routine .
I 've had enough of that in the Army .
You found another job ?
Not exactly , Mom ... but you see , I 've been doing engineering work in the Army ... and that 's the kind of work I want to do now .
A man 's job .
Where you can accomplish things .
Where you can build , construct , create . Do things !
That sounds very nice .
But after all ... a job in the hand is worth two in the bush .
I don 't want to tell you what to do , Jim ... but when you were in the war ... every time I passed the factory ...
We 've moved things around quite a bit .
This is a lot nicer than the old shipping room , isn 't it ?
You 'll sit by this window and check the shipments .
The job 's just about the same .
Before you know it , you 'll be doing it again with your eyes shut .
They 're excavating .
I shouldn 't think that would scare you .
I was looking for the nearest dugout .
You 'll hear lots of those explosions .
They 're building a new bridge over there .
Better get busy and file those bills of lading . Yes , sir .
It might do some good if you had another talk with Jim .
I certainly intend to .
Parker 's given him a job anyone in town would grab , and what does he do ?
Checks in day after day late from lunch .
Loitering around that new bridge for no reason at all .
He 'll come out of it ... but it worries me , too .
Is that you , Jim ?
It 's me , Mom .
Maybe you could speak to him now .
- Hello , Clint .
- You 're quite a stranger here .
- Had your supper ?
- No , I 'm not hungry .
- But you should have a bite of something .
- I can 't , Mom . I don 't feel like it .
Well , anyway , sit down .
I want to talk to you .
Jim , Mr. Parker 's very disappointed in you .
You haven 't shown him anything .
You know your duty is to your job .
I know it , but I just can 't help it .
Maybe you 're not well , dear .
It isn 't that , Mom .
I 'm all right .
I try my best when I get there , but I just can 't concentrate .
It 's not the kind of work I want to do .
I said so when I came home .
It 's too monotonous .
But you don 't seem to realize- -
That 's it , realize .
No one seems to realize that I have changed .
I 'm different now .
I 've been through hell .
Folks here are concerned with my uniform , how I dance .
I 'm out of step with everybody .
All this while I was hoping to come home and start a new life , to be free ... and again I find myself under orders .
A drab routine , cramped , mechanical .
Even worse than the Army .
And you , all of you trying your darnedest to map out my future ... to harness me and lead me around to do what you think is best for me .
It doesn 't occur to you that I 've grown ... that I 've learned life is more important than a medal on my chest ... or a stupid , insignificant job .
- Appreciation .
Why , you 've- -
- Clint .
What would you do , son ?
Where would you go ?
Somewhere .
Anywhere , Mom , just where I can do what I want to .
If that 's really in your heart ... I think you certainly should follow it .
I knew you 'd understand .
Before we know it , he 'll be leaving us again . That doesn 't matter .
He 's got to be happy .
He 's got to find himself .
You 're a peach , Mom .
I know where there 's a lot of construction going on .
Up in New England .
Hey , Allen !
Allen !
Calling me ?
Yeah , knock off a minute .
I want to see you .
- Well ?
- Bad news for you .
We 're cutting down and the new men will have to go .
Sorry .
All right .
- You the boss here ?
- Yep .
Think you could use a good man ?
Last week I could have used you , but I 'm full up now .
- You 're new here , ain 't you , buddy ?
- Yeah .
Just filling in for a couple of days .
Believe me , I 'm glad to be working .
It 's my first job in four months .
What can I do for you ?
How much can you give me for this Belgian Croix de Guerre ?
Come here , mister .
Look .
How about some poker to see who bums the handout ?
No , I 'm afraid not .
I 'm new in this town and not on to the ropes .
- Been on the road ?
- Yeah .
I took to walking the ties when my Rolls-Royce broke down .
- What 's your name ?
- James Allen .
James Allen ?
That 'll do , I guess .
Mine 's Pete .
- Glad to know you , Pete .
- Glad to know you , Allen .
I 'm hungry .
What would you say to a hamburger ?
What would I say to a hamburger ?
I 'd shake Mr. Hamburger by the hand and say :
" Pal , I haven 't seen you in a long , long time . "
I think I can mooch a couple in the lunch wagon down the street .
The guy who runs it is a pretty soft egg .
What do you say ?
Boy , I hope you ain 't fooling .
How about giving me and my friend a handout ?
I was hoping you 'd left town .
No , I 've incorporated .
Meet my partner .
Say , I 've been laying off you for a couple of days .
Come on , be a sport .
All right .
You guys sit over there .
What do I owe you ?
Fifteen cents .
Business is pretty good ?
Yeah , pretty good .
How good ?
Hey , what is this ?
Put your hands on that counter and lean over like we 're talking .
Get that dough out of the register .
- Listen--
- Go on , do as I say .
Go on .
How much is it ?
Around $ 5 .
There ought to be more .
Where is it ?
No , that 's all .
Put it in your pocket and come on .
And don 't start yelling for the cops .
You don 't have to yell , Mike .
Put them up .
Thought you 'd get away ?
I didn 't do nothing . - Oh , no ?
- No .
I see no reason for leniency since the money was found on your person .
Furthermore , upon detection , you attempted to escape ... which would , of necessity , increase the seriousness of your offence .
I therefore , in accordance with the laws of this state ... sentence you to 10 years of hard labor .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5,6 ... 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 .
A nice lucky number .
What 's this for ?
To put in your nose .
All right .
Follow me .
All right , pick them up .
Come on , pull them through .
All right , turn off .
That 'll learn you to sit up and hold on to this .
All right , you guys , get going there .
Get those shoes on and get up .
All right , come and get it .
Come on , hurry it up .
Pick up that chain .
Come on , move on .
Here , take that .
Grease , fried dough , pig fat and sorghum .
And you better get to like it ... because you 're going to get the same thing every morning , every year .
You can 't get better food on any chain gang in the state .
Yeah , and you can go all over the world and you won 't find worse .
How can anybody eat a mess like this ?
Why do you take that slime if you 're going to spit it out ?
I 'm practicing .
The last day of my year here , I 'll spit it right in the warden 's kisser . Yeah ?
You 'll blind him for life .
Hurry up , come on , let 's go .
Come on , move on !
- Come on , there . You , get in there .
- Get in that line .
Hurry up .
Come on , by me .
Line up , there .
Come on .
All right , load the trucks .
Come on .
Hurry up .
Put them up .
Come on , get that ring up .
All right , take them out .
Are you up here for murder , kid ?
No .
I heard that a guy that killed four people was being sent up here .
Nordine 's always worrying about losing his spot here as high man .
He only killed three .
More than anyone else in this here chain gang .
His wife , his sister-in-law , and his mother-in-law .
Killed them in one night with an ax ... so as not to disturb the neighbors .
What are you taking the rap for , kid ?
For looking at a hamburger .
Come on , tell us .
You 're among friends .
All right , let 's go .
On your feet .
Come on .
Hey , come on .
Hey , you , get to work .
Getting out here .
All right , get out in there .
What 's the idea ?
He gets two minutes to brush his teeth .
Look at that big buck swing that sledge .
He never misses .
You can lay down a nickel ... and he 'd knock the buffalo 's right eye out .
They like his work so much ... they 're gonna keep him here the rest of his life .
Come on , get up , quit your stalling .
I was just wiping the sweat off my face .
Well , you got it knocked off .
That won 't do no good .
You got to ask their permission to wipe the sweat off .
Wiping it off !
All right , Bomber , wipe it off .
Like that .
In the first place , you 've got to get their permission to sweat .
Come on , get to work there .
I gotta quit .
My stomach is- -
You get to work or I 'll kick that bellyache up around your ears . Come on . Move on , there .
Come on , get up .
Pull it through .
Six .
Seven .
Eight .
Nine .
Ten .
Eleven .
Spread them out .
Twelve .
Come on , get out of here .
So this is the washroom ?
Yeah , come on , there 's plenty of room .
No , thanks .
I forgot my bath salts .
All right , boys , show me the men that didn 't give us a good day 's work .
Ackerman hasn 't been on the job today , Warden .
Is that so ?
Come on .
Anybody else ?
This guy , Red , tried to pull a faint on us today .
Pulling a faint ?
I don 't care what you do to me .
It doesn 't matter .
So that 's the way you feel about it ?
Take a look at that .
The skunk .
You 're next .
Take his stinking shirt off .
A loudmouth ?
All right , let him out .
Stand over there .
Well , Barney 's gone .
Goodbye , Barney , old boy .
Don 't forget to write , kid .
I 'll see you in two or three years .
Goodbye , kid .
Don 't forget to write , Barney .
- So long .
- So long .
See you soon .
- Good luck . - You need it .
The lucky rat .
At least it proves something .
You really can get out of here .
Sure you can .
And I 'm counting the days .
They ain 't gonna cheat me out of nothing .
- When is your time up ?
- I got it figured out exactly .
Four days , two weeks , seven months and 12 years .
Let me see .
Four weeks from 10 years .
Nine years and 48 weeks .
You can 't count those away .
Red 's leaving today , too .
All right , hurry it up .
Let 's go .
Well , there 's just two ways to get out of here .
Work out , and die out .
Might as well grab a ride into town with us .
Yeah , I can 't walk very good without them chains on .
Doesn 't a man ever break loose ?
You mean , hang it on the limb ?
There 's too many breaks against you .
You 've got to beat the chains , the bloodhounds ... and a bunch of guards who 'd just as soon bring you back dead .
It 's been done ... but you got to figure out some perfect scheme .
You gotta watch .
You gotta wait .
Maybe one year , maybe two .
Then ... hang it on the limb .
- Sebastian . - Yes ? Can you hit my shackles hard enough to bend them ?
- You thinking about- -
- Been thinking about it for months .
If you can bend my shackles just so I can slide them off my foot- -
I don 't want to get in no trouble , but I 'd like to see you get away .
The heat 's got the guards down .
- All right , you keep an eye on them .
I 'll keep my foot here , and you hit it whenever you can .
You gotta promise not to yell , no matter how it hurts ... - or they 'll give me the works for it .
- I promise .
Hold still .
If I hurt your leg , your foot will drop off with the shackle .
Again .
Now the other one .
Again .
Once more .
Five .
Six .
Seven .
Eight .
Nine .
Ten .
When you gonna do it ?
- Monday .
- That 's good .
You can rest up for it on Sunday .
- Got any dough ?
- A little .
Here 's $ 7 .
When you get to Stanton , look up Barney .
Here 's his address .
- He 'll take care of you . - Thanks , Bomber .
- Nervous ?
- A little .
No matter what happens , it 's better than this .
Get them over there .
What do you think ?
Looks pretty good to me .
Getting out here .
All right , get out over in there .
Hey , boss , we need some more help here .
Some of you boys give Bomber a hand .
All right , Allen .
Get back to work .
Bring those dogs over here !
He won 't get far .
Stand where you are .
Where do you suppose he 's gone ?
Let 's try these woods over here .
Come on . Go get him .
Get him .
You look like a new man .
- Now show me something in a cheap hat . - Yes , sir .
How did you get the scratches ?
Lumberjacking , up in the hills .
Is that a fact ?
I know many of them fellows up there .
Funny I ain 't seen you before .
- Look out .
- I 'm sorry .
How do you do ?
Well , if it ain 't old John Law himself .
- How 's the rheumatism ?
- Good .
If they don 't take me off nights and put me on days , I 'm gonna ...
I 'll ... What 's the use ?
What 's new ? Anything ?
Nothing .
There was a break on the Merritt County chain gang this morning .
They say he 's headed up this way .
What 's the guy look like ?
He 's about 5 ' 10 " , heavy black hair ... brown eyes , stocky built , around 30 years old .
Name is Allen , James Allen .
- Get us a hot towel , will you ?
- Coming up .
Hope it 's hot enough for you .
Those guys haven 't got much chance getting away with it , have they ?
No .
We 've got the depot and all the highways out of town covered .
They can get this far and no farther .
Thanks .
Come in again .
How was it ? Close enough ?
Plenty .
So you hung it on the limb ?
It 's good to see you , kid .
- Well , how do you suppose I feel ?
- What ? How ?
Bomber tipped me off where you were .
- All right for Bomber .
- Say , you got a place I can hide out ?
- Sure , come on .
I 'll fix you up .
- That 's great .
How are all the boys on the chain gang ?
No , but I had to keep my eyes open every minute .
Do you think I 'll be safe here tonight ?
It 's a cinch , unless the cops pull another raid .
But don 't worry about that .
They 're probably too busy looking for you to raid any joints like this .
All I need is some sleep .
I 'll lam out of here early in the morning .
Make yourself at home .
We got everything you dream about in the chain gang .
Here .
I guess you still know what this is good for ?
Thanks .
I got a tough day ahead of me tomorrow .
Well , I got a tough night ahead of me .
I got to beat it now , Jim .
But the place is yours .
Wait a minute .
I 'll get somebody to see that you 're comfortable .
Linda , come here .
This is Jim Allen , a pal of mine from the chain gang .
He 's just escaped .
- Listen , never mind the advertising .
- It 's all right with Linda .
Take good care of him , babe .
He 's my personal guest .
- So long , Jim .
I hope you make it . - Thanks .
You 've got plenty of what it takes to pull an escape from that place .
I 'm not safe yet .
Not until I 'm out of the state .
If there 's anything I can do to help you , just say the word .
Thanks . There 's nothing you can do .
- How about a drink ?
- No .
- You don 't mind if I take one , do you ?
- No , go right ahead .
Here 's to you .
A guy with your nerves got the breaks coming to him .
I know what you 're thinking .
I understand .
You 're among friends .
You have about 35 minutes to wait . The train is late .
- You want everything on this one , too ?
- Yeah , same as the first one .
Well , look who 's here .
Chief of police , in all his glory .
Must be looking for somebody important .
All right , boys , keep your eyes open .
All aboard !
There he is !
Did I get your ticket ?
Here it is .
Booneville ? You must have got on without me seeing you .
They were chasing somebody .
I guess you were watching .
- They were after an escaped convict .
- Catch him ?
No , the guy they caught turned out to be a hobo .
They 're still looking for the convict .
I guess we can use you .
What 's the name ?
- Allen .
- Is that the first or last name ?
Yeah , the first name .
The full name is Allen James .
- Report 8 : 00 tomorrow morning .
- Yes , sir .
Say , James ... that 's a swell idea you had about the bend up there .
- I told the boss it was your suggestion .
- You did ? That 's very nice .
I don 't think you 'll be swinging a pick much longer .
This is the room that 's for rent .
Very nice room .
What are you asking for it ?
- $ 25 a month . And that 's very reasonable . - Very .
But it 's more than I feel I can pay .
I 'm sorry , because I like the location .
It 's not far from the bridge I 'm working on .
I 'm sorry , too ... because I 'd like to rent this room to a gentleman like yourself .
But you don 't know anything about me .
I can tell . You look like you 'd be friendly .
Not like a stranger around the house .
- How much would you be willing to pay ?
- Really , it 's out of the question .
Well , suppose I made it $ 20 .
That 's silly .
You can easily get your price for it .
I 'm willing to let it go for $ 20 . To you .
Well , it 's a mighty nice room .
You 'll like it .
- Hello , honey . - Hello .
- All you do every night is study .
- I 'll never get anywhere if I don 't .
Anyway , that 's not so . We were out last night .
- I don 't think you like me anymore .
- Of course I do .
We can 't always be playing around .
Anyway , what 's that got to do with it ?
I don 't know , but you don 't act like you used to .
- Now I don 't seem good enough for you .
- You 're imagining things .
No , I 'm not .
When you were first here you weren 't this way .
You 've grown tired of me .
I was silly enough to believe you when you said you loved me .
I said I loved you ?
Now , Marie , you know that 's not so .
I never said that .
You 're just trying to put me in a spot .
And you know it wasn 't love just as well as I do .
So that 's the way you feel ?
You can 't make me out cheap and get away with it .
I know what I 'm talking about , see ?
And someday you 're gonna be sorry .
Come in .
Well , so you really think you 're leaving ?
I 'm moving to a bigger place . I can afford it now .
In other words , that means we won 't see each other anymore .
No , I guess we 'll see each other sometime .
You don 't mean that .
Marie , I appreciate all you 've done for me , but I couldn 't love you .
I can 't change my feeling towards you any more than ... I can change the color of my eyes .
I know I 'm speaking bluntly , but frankly ... this will save us both a lot of misery .
And is that your only reason for leaving ?
- That 's a pretty good one , isn 't it ?
- Not very .
Of course , when a fellow wants to ditch a girl he 'll do most anything ... providing it doesn 't land him back in the chain gang ... where he probably belongs . Here .
It 's from your brother .
- You wouldn 't ...
- I wouldn 't tell ... if I had a reason to protect you .
- I wouldn 't tell ... if you were my husband . - What do you mean ?
- Well , it means plenty of work .
- I 'm used to that .
Yes .
On the other hand , all work and no play ... Makes Jack .
How about knocking off and having a little recreation ?
We 're giving a party tonight at the Club Chateau .
How about joining us ?
- I 'd like to , but- - - Fine .
And that includes Mrs. James .
Well , I don 't know .
I 'm not sure that she can come . - I 'll ask her .
- Right .
- Anyway , we 'll expect you .
- Fine .
See you later .
Here 's the revised budget on the King 's Highway Bridge .
By the way , while you were out , your wife called .
Any message ?
She won 't be home until Wednesday .
She 's gone to the country with her cousin .
I see .
She also said her account was overdrawn .
About $ 600 .
She 's got to stop it .
The same thing happened last month .
All right , make out a check for the amount ... and deposit it in her bank when you go to lunch .
Yes , sir .
- Good night , Mr. James .
- Good night .
Hello .
Hello , yourself .
Is Marie there ?
That 's funny .
Where do you think she is ?
She had a date with me and she 's giving me a stand-up ... and it 's the first dame that ever gave me a stand-up .
You can tell her that Sammy called ... and you can tell her where she can go with little Sammy 's compliments .
Tell her that , will you ?
And listen ... not a word to her husband , understand ?
- Don 't you dance ?
- Not if I can get out of it .
That makes two of us .
I don 't care much for dancing in such a crowd .
- I don 't like crowds anywhere .
- What do you like to do ?
Build bridges , roads for people to use ... when they want to get away from things .
That sounds interesting .
But they can 't get away .
Nobody can .
You 're a strange person .
Don 't pay any attention to what I say .
You 'd like to get away from here right now , wouldn 't you ?
You don 't like this party .
I like it better now .
Well , I was on the verge of sneaking home . I 'm not so sure I want to now . We might make a getaway .
I don 't think they 'd miss us .
How about it ?
Come on .
Well , here we are .
Tell me some more about your work .
It sounds fascinating .
Why talk about work ?
That 's what interests you , isn 't it ?
No . There are other things that interest me , too .
Do you mind if we stay here a while , or must you go home ?
There are no musts in my life .
I 'm free , white and 21 .
- You 're lucky .
- Why ?
You can go where you want , when you want .
Can 't you ?
Yes . And no .
You 're a strange , moody person .
You need somebody to pull you out of those doldrums .
Are you applying for that job ?
- I might consider it .
- You 're hired .
- When do I start ?
- You 've started , several hours ago .
Don 't you see , Marie ?
If you get a divorce , I 'll give you anything you want .
I swear I will .
What 's the use of arguing ?
I told you I was satisfied with the way things are .
- Can 't you see that neither of us is happy ?
- I 'm happy !
I 'm taking no chances of letting you go .
You 're going to be a big shot some day , with plenty of sugar ... and I 'm going to ride right along . Listen . Get that ?
I 'm no fool . I 'd be a sucker to let you go now .
But I 'm in love with another woman .
That 's just too bad .
Why don 't you play the game square ?
Square ?
So that you and your sweet mama can give me the grand go-by ?
Be yourself .
If you don 't listen to reason , I 'll find some way .
You do , and you 'll serve out your time .
It 's no worse than serving out my time with you .
You 'll be sorry you said that !
Now , listen .
You 've held a sword over my head about long enough .
It 's about time you called it quits .
You 've been bluffing me , and I 've been fool and coward enough to fall for it .
You filthy , good-for-nothing convict !
A bluff ?
You 'll see .
- You 'll see .
- Put that down .
- Give me the police station .
- Put that down !
You don 't think you 'll stop me , do you , now that I 've made up my mind ?
We 'll only take a minute of your time , Mr. James .
In view of your marvelous achievement on the new Stevens Bridge ... the Chamber of Commerce would like you as their principal speaker at their banquet .
Thank you very much .
I feel highly complimented .
There 's two detectives coming through , Mr. James .
I told them you were busy but they wouldn 't wait .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm afraid you 'll have to excuse me .
Mr. James or Mr. Allen or whatever your name is ...
I have a warrant for your arrest .
- And we can quote you literally ?
- Certainly .
Everything I 've said are facts .
I want this rotten chain-gang system exposed .
Print it all !
How about a special signed story for our Sunday supplement ?
Sure , I 'll write it .
Gladly .
How long were you on the chain gang before , Mr. Allen ?
Governor Baxter has not yet signed the extradition papers .
Until he does , I cannot turn Mr. Allen over to the custody of your state .
In view of Allen 's record here since his escape ... our state has authorized us to assure you ... that if he 'll return voluntarily ... and pay the state the expense it 's been put to ... he 'll be pardoned in 90 days .
Why is it necessary for my client to return at all ?
Why mete out punishment to a man who has proven himself a useful ... and honorable citizen ?
Merely a technicality .
No prisoner is eligible for pardon until he 's served 90 days .
Does that mean that I 'll have to serve 90 days ?
- Back on the chain gang ?
- No .
You 'll be given some clerical job in one of the camps .
Well , it rests entirely with my client ... but I 'd advise him to stay right here .
Gentlemen , there 's someone else I 'd like to consult on the matter ... - if you don 't mind .
- Certainly .
They 've promised me a full pardon within 90 days if I go back .
Can you trust them ?
I don 't see why not .
I 'm giving myself up voluntarily .
Besides , I want to get it all cleaned up now ... so that nothing will stand in the way of our happiness .
I think it best , darling .
Why , they can 't fail to pardon you .
And then , when you come back , you 'll be free . For always .
And we 'll be together . Always .
These stories you 've been hearing , gentlemen , are absurd .
Why , our chain gangs are beneficial to the convicts ... not only physically , but morally . I can cite you- -
Gentlemen , I 've decided to go back .
Voluntarily .
On your assurance of a pardon .
And you won 't regret your decision .
I presume , Mr. Allen , your Chicago attorneys informed you ... that I would be in complete charge of your case down here ?
Yes , he did .
Let 's get the financial end straightened out first .
Your capture and return cost the state ... $ 350 .
My fee will be $ 2,500 .
$ 1,000 now , and $ 1,500 when you get your release .
This is for the state .
You know , of course ... that you 'll have to go to a prison camp for 90 days .
- There 's your check .
- Thanks , Allen .
There 's no reason to believe that after the 90 days ... I won 't get my pardon then , is there ?
This is a funny state and the Governor 's a little peculiar .
You see , all that publicity you gave out about the conditions here ... didn 't help any .
But I 'll get my pardon ?
They 'll give you the pardon .
But that clerical job they promised you isn 't so definite .
They might want you to work for about 60 days .
This is the guy that all that fuss was about .
And if he tries to escape this time , shoot him !
Escape ?
I 'm supposed to be a trustee here .
Haven 't you had orders from the Prison Commission ?
Sure , I got orders ... that if you get away from here this time , I lose my job .
And that goes for all of you . Get me ?
- Now take him out of here .
- Come on .
Go on .
Find yourself a bunk .
Go on down the line .
How did you get to this little bit of heaven , kid ?
It 's a long story .
Sit down , make yourself at home .
If you can .
Boy , if you think those other chain gangs are tough ... wait till you get a load of this joint .
These are the guys that were too tough for the chain gangs .
Now give us the story .
How 'd they snatch you back ?
They didn 't .
I came back .
He just got lonesome .
They promised me a pardon if I 'd come back for 90 days .
What 's a pardon ?
These boys up here ain 't never heard that word .
Neither has the Prison Commission .
What 'd you do to get sent up here , Bomber ?
I decided to hang it on the limb , so I socked a guard with a sledge .
I aimed at the rat 's head , but I missed .
I can 't figure a guy walking back into this ... just because they promised to spring him in 90 days .
They just wanna make it tough on me , I guess .
But I 'll get the pardon , all right- -
Listen , kid , they ain 't thinking of handing out pardons when you land in here .
This is the last word .
You might say it 's " it . "
Come on , get to work down there !
The case of James Allen .
- Is Mr. Ramsey present ?
- Ready , Your Honor .
Please be brief .
We have a great many of these cases this afternoon .
I should first like to introduce ... the convict 's brother , the Rev. Robert Allen .
Your Honor ...
I shall leave the legal technicalities of the case to Mr. Ramsey ... and shall present the story of James Allen as a human being .
A man of essential fineness and integrity of character .
A man who was decorated for bravery in the World War .
A man who committed a crime ... but only when forced to at the point of a gun .
His first and only offence .
A man who showed his true character by rising from less than nothing ... to become a prominent and honored citizen .
... and in conclusion , I need not remind you ... that James Allen has kept his part of the bargain .
He has returned voluntarily to this state ... and has paid all the expenses demanded of him .
I cannot believe , in the light of all this evidence ... and in the name of justice ... that you will bring yourselves even to consider any other alternative .
First , I feel it is my duty ... to answer the malicious and unwarranted attack upon the chain-gang system ... which we have heard here this afternoon .
Crime must be punished .
The men who commit crime are hard men ... and their punishments must be hard .
But the brutality of which we hear is a gross exaggeration ... born of the fancy of the misinformed .
The life of a convict in a chain gang is one of hard labor .
The discipline is strict ... but there is no brutality .
The purpose of prison is not only to punish crime ... but to discourage it .
And there is less crime in this state ... in proportion to her population ... than in 40 other states in this Union .
Finally , as evidence of the chain gang 's value ... as a character-builder , I have but to present to you ... the very case that has been presented to us here today ... the case of James Allen ... who entered the chain gang as a worthless tramp ... and who left it to become one of a great city 's ... most worthy and respected citizens .
The Commission will take the case of James Allen under consideration .
Five minutes , Allen .
They refused to pardon you .
They refused ?
The state 's promise didn 't mean anything .
It was all lies !
They just wanted to get me back ... so they can have their revenge .
To keep me here nine more years !
Why , their crimes are worse than mine .
Worse than anybody here !
They 're the ones that should be in chains , not me !
You don 't have to stay here nine years .
The Commission voted that if you were a model prisoner for one year ... they would concede that you had paid your obligations in full .
It 's only nine months , Jim .
Nine months of this torture ?
I won 't do it ! I won 't do it , I tell you !
I 'll get out of here !
Even if they kill me for it !
It 's still better to be honorably free .
And in those nine months , we 'll be working for you night and day .
But you 've been working night and day !
It didn 't do any good .
But , Jim , we 'll have the whole country behind you then ... and the state will be forced to release you .
All right .
I 'll wait nine more months .
I 'll be a model prisoner ... if it kills me .
Finally , not only has James Allen been a model prisoner ... patient and uncomplaining for a whole year ... but we have presented letters from countless organizations ... and prominent individuals ... beseeching you to recommend his pardon .
I think it only just , Your Honors ... that he be given his freedom while there is still time ... for him to regain his former position in society ... of prominence and universal respect .
We 've just had a final report on your new hearing .
Well ?
They 've suspended decision . Indefinitely . - Which one did you say it was ?
- This one here .
Get up , you lazy skunk !
- Driver !
- What 's on your mind ?
- You better come take a look back here .
- I gotta get to the quarry .
You 'll never make the quarry in this truck .
Your spring 's broken .
Spring 's broken ?
- Where ?
- There it is .
Thief !
He 's stealing my truck !
Stay where you are !
Keep driving , boy .
Throw that box out .
Nix , it 's full of my favorite candy .
We 're making it , Jim .
We 'll make it yet .
Rip it , boy . Go on .
Keep going , kid .
That 's once I didn 't miss .
Getting out here .
Helen .
Jim !
- Why haven 't you come before ?
- I couldn 't .
- I was afraid to .
- But you could have written .
It 's been almost a year since you escaped .
But I haven 't escaped .
They 're still after me .
They 'll always be after me .
I 've had jobs , but I can 't keep them .
Something happens , someone turns up .
I hide in rooms all day and travel by night .
No friends , no rest , no peace . - Oh , Jim !
- Keep moving , that 's all that 's left for me .
Forgive me , Helen .
I had to take a chance to see you tonight . Just to say goodbye .
- It was all going to be so different .
- It is different .
They 've made it different .
I 've got to go .
I can 't let you go like this .
Can 't you tell me where you 're going ?
Will you write ?
Do you need any money ?
But you must , Jim . How do you live ?
I steal .
English
The channel 's here on the chart .
So are the marking lights .
Then what 's wrong with them ?
Those lights don 't seem to be in just the right place .
They 're both a bit out of position , according to this .
Two light buoys mean a safe channel between the world over .
" Safe between the world over " doesn 't go in these waters .
Look here .
You 'll see the water shoals on the island side ... while the deep soundings run to the mainland .
Have any of you seen the captain today ?
- No .
He wasn 't down for dinner .
- No , and he wasn 't down for lunch .
He hasn 't left the bridge since you decided to come through the channel .
What are you driving at ?
Ever since you gave him those orders yesterday to cut through these waters ... he 's had the jitters .
There 's something wrong .
I ... Hey , I 'm getting nervous myself .
Doc , what do you recommend for nerves ?
- Give him a shot of scotch .
- Give the whole bottle .
- No ! I 've got nerves too .
- Here you are , Doc .
Just what you need .
- Well , maybe you 're right .
- And how , boy .
- Good evening , Captain .
- Good evening , sir .
- May I speak with you ?
- Why , certainly .
Go ahead .
We 're heading straight for the channel between Branca Island and the mainland .
- Good .
- But the lights are just a bit off , according to the chart .
The charts are never up to date in this part of the Pacific . You know that .
I know , sir , but ...
Doesn 't Branca Island mean anything to you ?
- Well , not a lot .
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr. Rainsford ...
Bob 's not a sailor .
He 's a hunter .
He 's made many of these trips .
He 's young , but he has judgment .
I 'll call him .
- Oh , Bob . Bob !
- What is it ?
- Come up here , will ya ?
- Just a minute .
What 's bothering you , Captain ?
There are no more coral-reefed , shark-infested waters in the whole world than these .
Boy ! Just take a look at these .
You didn 't turn out so hot as a hunter , Doc , but oh , what a photographer .
If we 'd had you to take pictures on the Sumatran trip ... they might have believed my book .
If you 'd had me on the Sumatran trip , you 'd have never had me on this one .
Say , here 's a swell one of the ship , Skipper . What 's the matter ?
These old sea dogs tell yarns to kid each other ... and end up believing it all themselves .
I think that Mr. Rainsford should know ... that the channel lights aren 't just in the position given on the charts .
Oh . Well , what do you think , fellas ?
I think we should turn back and take the outside course .
We 'll go ahead .
Very well , sir .
It 's your ship .
" It was the schooner ' Hesperus , ' and she sailed the wintry sea . "
Now , wait a minute , fellas .
Let 's talk this over .
- There 's no use taking any chances .
- Chances ?
That 's fine talk ... coming from a fella who just got through slapping tigers in the face .
Get an eyeful of this .
And he talks about taking chances .
Here 's the doc charging the enemy with an unloaded camera .
Get the expression on Doc 's face , Bill .
He looks more frightened than the tiger .
- He is .
- What 'd you have on your mind , Doc ?
I 'll tell you what I had on my mind .
I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization .
The beast of the jungle killing just for his existence is called savage .
The man , killing just for sport , is called civilized .
- Hear ! Hear !
- It 's a bit contradictory , isn 't it ?
Now , just a minute .
What makes you think ... it isn 't just as much sport for the animal as it is for the man ?
Take that fellow right there , for instance .
There never was a time when he couldn 't have gotten away .
He didn 't want to .
He got interested in hunting me .
He didn 't hate me for stalking him ... any more than I hated him for trying to charge me .
As a matter of fact , we admired each other .
Perhaps , but would you change places with the tiger ?
- Well , not now .
Here comes that bad-luck lady again .
Third time tonight .
- Here . Let me shuffle them .
- Wait a minute . Don 't evade the issue .
- Yeah , speak up .
- I asked you a question .
- You did ?
I forgot .
- Oh , no , you didn 't .
I asked you if there 'd be as much sport in the game ... if you were the tiger instead of the hunter .
- Come on .
- What 's your answer now , Bob ?
That 's something I 'll never have to decide .
Listen here , you fellows .
This world 's divided into two kinds of people ... the hunter and the hunted .
Luckily , I 'm a hunter .
Nothing can ever change that .
Hang on !
Hello !
Hello , down there !
Hello , Engine Room !
- The panel is flooded !
- If the water hits those hot boilers ...
Help !
Help !
You trying to drown me ?
Where are the others ?
See anybody ?
Nobody left but us two and ... that fella .
Doc !
Help !
- Look !
- Shark !
Ohh !
It got me !
Hello !
Anybody around , I say .
Oh , hello .
Is this your house ?
I 'm not trying to break in , but I 've been in a wreck .
Our yacht just sunk with all hands .
I got ashore and found your place here by accident .
I 'm not trying to intrude , but I 'm in sort of a jam .
Don 't you understand any English ?
Ivan does not speak any language .
He has the misfortune to be dumb .
Oh , hello .
Are you the owner here ?
Yes .
Welcome to my poor fortress .
- Fortress ?
- It once was .
Built by the Portuguese , centuries ago .
I have had the ruins restored to make my home here .
I am Count Zaroff .
My name 's Robert Rainsford .
Glad to meet you .
Very glad .
Ivan is a Cossack .
I am afraid , like all my fellow countrymen , he is a bit of a savage .
Smile , Ivan .
I was trying to make him understand there 'd been a shipwreck in the channel .
But how appalling !
And you mean to say that you are the only survivor ?
Yes , I 'm afraid I am .
You 're certain ?
I 'd have never left the spot if I hadn 't been .
The swellest crowd on Earth ...
my best friends .
- It 's incredible .
- Such things are always incredible .
Death is for others , not for ourselves .
That is how most of my other guests have felt .
Your other guests ?
You mean this has happened before ?
My fellow , we have several survivors from the last wreck still in the house .
It would seem that this island were cursed .
That 's just what the captain said .
Only he thought it was uninhabited .
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude .
- Well , it 's a break for me , anyway .
- My house is yours .
Oh , by the way .
You 'll want to change those wet rags immediately . Yes .
They look about the way I feel .
Yes .
I have some loose hunting clothes which I keep for my guests ... that you can possibly get into .
Ivan will show you to your room .
- Thank you .
- You 'll find a stiff drink there also . Thanks a lot .
All pleasure is mine .
Come in .
- Ready , Rainsford ?
- All set .
I 'm afraid we have finished dinner .
But I have ordered something for you .
Thanks .
I don 't feel like eating , though .
Oh . Well , perhaps later .
Now , then , what do you say to coffee ... and most charming company ?
It is hard to forget your comrades ' fate , I know ... but our feminine guest is easily perturbed .
If I could beg you to put a good face upon the matter .
A-Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel .
- Why , sure .
Of course .
- Thank you .
Miss Trowbridge , may I present Mr. Robert Rainsford .
- Miss Eve Trowbridge .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- And her brother , Mr. Martin Trowbridge .
How are you , old chap ?
Pretty well shaken up , I guess , huh ?
- Coming out of it now , thanks .
- We know how it feels , don 't we , Eve ?
Indeed we do .
Perhaps Mr. Rainsford would like some hot coffee .
Oh , yes , of course .
Mr. Rainsford , please sit here .
Vodka , that 's the stuff !
One shot 'll dry you out quicker than all the coffee in Java .
Have to toss it off , though .
Like this .
Now , Martin , you don 't have to drink it all tonight , do you ?
Don 't be ridiculous , sis .
We are victims of circumstance .
Same as Mr. Rainsford .
And if anyone has a right to his liquor , it 's a victim of circumstance .
- Isn 't that so , Count ?
- Of course , yes .
- You were in a shipwreck too ?
- Yes .
Our lifeboat was the only one saved ... my brother and I and two sailors .
The count found us on the beach with nothing but the clothes on our backs .
Those channel lights must have been shifted .
- I wonder it hasn 't been reported .
- Well , we 'll report ' em ... just as soon as we get back to the mainland .
You see , the count has only one launch ... and that 's under repair .
Russians are not the best mechanics .
I 'm afraid we 'll have to be patient a few days longer .
It 's all right with me .
I feel as if I were living on borrowed time right now .
Speaking of that , perhaps now you 'll tell us ... a little bit about who you are .
Just sketchily , you know ...
born , married , why I left my last job .
No , no , no , no .
One moment , please .
Mr. Rainsford need never explain who he is in my house .
We entertain a celebrity , Miss Trowbridge .
Wait a minute , wait a minute .
Don 't tell me .
Let me guess .
I know .
Flagpole sitter .
- I know .
He wrote some books .
- No , he lived some books .
If I am not mistaken , this is Mr. Robert Rainsford ... who hunts big game so adventurously .
Yeah ?
Here 's to ya .
- I 've lugged a gun around a little .
- " I 've lugged a gun around a little . "
No , I have read your books .
I read all books on hunting .
- A papiroso ?
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view .
- What do you mean , " sane " ?
- Cigarette ? - Hmm ?
Yeah . Thanks .
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse . Let me see .
How did you put it ?
" Hunting is as much a game as stud poker ... only the limits are higher . "
- You have put our case perfectly .
- Then you 're a hunter yourself ?
We are kindred spirits .
It is my one passion .
He sleeps all day and hunts all night .
And what 's more , Rainsford , he 'll have you doing the same thing .
We 'll have capital sport together , I hope .
Don 't encourage him .
He 's had our two sailors so busy ... chasing around the woods after flora and fauna ... that we haven 't seen them for three days .
But what do you hunt here ?
I 'll tell you .
You will be amused , I know .
I have done a rare thing .
I have invented a new sensation .
Yeah , and is he stingy with it .
What is this sensation , Count ?
Mr. Rainsford , God made some men poets .
Some He made kings , some beggars .
Me , He made a hunter .
My hand was made for the trigger , my father told me .
He was a very rich man ... with a quarter of a million acres in the Crimea , and an ardent sportsman .
When I was only still up high he gave me my first gun .
- Good for him .
- My life has been one glorious hunt .
It would be impossible for me to tell you how many animals I have killed .
- But when the revolution ...
- Look out .
Oh , I 'm so sorry .
Count Zaroff was so interesting ... I didn 't realize the danger .
Oh , it 's all right now .
What were you saying about the revolution , Count ?
Oh , merely that I escaped with most of my fortune .
Naturally , I continued to hunt all over the world .
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo gave me this .
That must have been a close call .
Yes .
It still bothers me sometimes .
However , in two months I was on my way to the Amazon .
I 'd heard that the jaguars there were unusually cunning .
No , no , no .
No sport at all .
Well , conditions are bad everywhere these days .
One night , as I lay in my tent with this ... this head of mine ... a terrible thought crept like a snake into my brain .
Hunting was beginning to bore me .
Is that such a terrible thought , Count ?
It is , my dear lady , when hunting has been the whip for all other passions .
When I lost my love of hunting ... I lost my love of life ... of love .
Well , you seem to have stood it pretty well .
I even tried to sink myself to the level of the savage .
I made myself perfect in the use of the Tartar war bow .
Tartar which ?
Tartar war bow ...
That one up there .
It 's cute .
Even to this day I prefer to hunt with it ... but alas , even that was too deadly .
What I needed was not a new weapon ... but a new animal .
- A new animal ?
- Exactly so .
You found one ?
Yes .
Here on my island ... I hunt the most dangerous game .
" The most dangerous game " ?
You mean tigers ?
Tigers ?
No .
The tiger has nothing but his claws and his fangs .
I heard some queer beast howling back there along the water .
Was that it ?
It 's no use , Rainsford .
He won 't tell .
He won 't even let you see his trophy room ... till he gets ready to take you on a hunt of the great whatsit .
My one secret .
You let me in on that game ... and I 'll bet you I go for it .
You know , Rainsford , he hasn 't failed yet .
If he says a thing is good , it is good .
He 's a judge of liquor , wizard at contract ... plays the piano ... anything you want .
He 's a good host and a good scholar , eh , Count ?
Yes , yes .
You want me to go hunting ?
You just say the word .
We 're pals .
We 'll have a big party , get cockeyed and go hunting .
A completely civilized point of view .
I tell you what you do .
You come to my place in the Adirondacks , see .
We 'll have a private car , liquor and gals on the trip ... and the guides will make the deers behave .
I think we 'd better change the subject .
All right .
Change the subject .
Oh , I know !
Play the piano , huh ?
If you wish .
Good idea .
Play the piano .
Leave it to me , and I 'll fix everything .
Perhaps the count doesn 't want to play .
There you go , sis , throwing cold water .
Leave me alone .
I know where the piano is .
I 'm perfectly sober .
Charming simplicity .
" Completely civilized , " did you say ?
He talks of wine and women as a prelude to the hunt .
We barbarians know that it is after the chase ... and then only that man revels .
It does seem a bit like cocktails before breakfast .
Of course , yes .
You know the saying of the Ugandi chieftains ...
" Hunt first the enemy , then the woman . "
That 's the savages ' idea everywhere .
It is the natural instinct .
What is woman ...
even such a woman as this ... until the blood is quickened by the kill ?
- Oh , I don 't know .
- " Oh , I don 't know . "
You Americans .
One passion builds upon another .
Kill !
Then love .
When you have known that ... you will have known ecstasy .
Oh , Martin !
Here you see Zaroff , the keyboard king ... in his Branca Island hour .
Come on , Count .
Now , you show them .
- What do you suggest ?
- Oh , just a good tune .
But not highbrow , like last night .
- Just a good tune , see ?
- I see .
Oh , his hunting dogs .
Keep your voice low and listen .
It isn 't true about the launch needing repairs .
I heard it leave the boathouse last night .
It returned this morning .
You mean he 's keeping you from returning to the mainland ?
Yes .
Well , perhaps he enjoys the company of two very charming people .
Two , maybe .
There were four of us a week ago .
- The other two have disappeared .
- What do you mean ?
One night after dinner , the count took one of our sailors ... down to see his trophy room ... at the foot of those stone steps .
- That iron door ?
- Yes .
Two nights later he took the other there .
Neither has been seen since .
Have you asked him about them ?
He says they 've gone hunting .
Oh , be careful . He 's watching us .
Will you smile , as if I 'd said something funny ?
You must be mistaken .
Not now .
Applaud .
- Attaboy ! Attaboy !
- Thank you .
What did I tell you ?
Smacks a mean ivory , eh , Rainsford ?
It was splendid .
Don 't stop , please .
I 'm afraid we have failed to hold the full attention of our audience .
Well , I expect it 's rather difficult for Mr. Rainsford ... to concentrate on anything after all he 's been through .
My dear lady , you are pleading for yourself .
I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes .
Excuse me .
You know , the count 's worse than a family governess .
Every night he sends us off to bed like naughty children .
Oh , no , my dear .
No .
Charming children .
There , you hear that , sis ?
Now trot along upstairs and don 't bother us grownups anymore .
Well , after that I guess ... I guess I 'll have to go .
- Good night , Mr. Rainsford .
- Good night .
We 'll be seeing each other at breakfast .
- Good night . - Good night .
Good night , sis .
We won 't be seeing each other at breakfast .
Oh , my dear Rainsford , I have been most inconsiderate .
You must be feeling the need of sleep too .
- Yes , I am just about all in .
- Then Ivan will show you to your room .
Oh , Martin , turn in early , please ?
Don 't worry .
The count 'll take care of me , all right .
Indeed I shall .
- Well , good night .
- Good night , sir .
Sleep well .
Oh , uh , well , here 's to long life .
A long life .
Tell me , Mr. Trowbridge ... are you also fatigued ?
Tired ?
Me ?
You know I 'm not .
You know , Rainsford , we two are just alike .
Up all night and sleep all day .
Well , good night .
Well , what are we gonna do , huh ?
What 's the big idea ?
I thought that perhaps ... tonight you would like to see my trophy room ?
Your trophy room ?
I 'm sure you will find it most ... interesting .
Say , that 's a great idea .
Ho-ho . Now we 're pals .
No more secrets now , huh ?
- We 'll make a night of it .
- I hope so , Mr. Trowbridge .
Just you and I ... pals .
We 'll have fun together , huh ?
Precisely , yes .
Fun together .
Attaboy , County , old boy , old boy , County .
Please let me come in .
I 'm sorry to disturb you , but I 'm frightened .
Those dogs ?
- My brother .
I 've been listening for hours for him to come upstairs .
I 've just gone to his room .
He isn 't there !
- He 's probably somewhere with the count .
- That 's just what I 'm afraid of .
Count Zaroff is planning something ... about my brother and me .
You don 't really think anything has happened to your brother ?
Oh , I don 't know , but we 've got to find him .
Won 't you help me ?
Why , of course I 'll help you .
- Where do you think he 's gone ?
- Where did the others go ?
The iron door .
I 'll meet you downstairs in five minutes .
Thank you .
That 's queer .
It 's unlocked .
Zaroff !
He 's coming down .
Back here , quick !
Where is my brother ?
Where is my brother ?
You killed him !
You killed my brother !
You !
Come , come , my dear Rainsford .
I don 't want to treat you like my other guests .
You and I , we are hunters .
So that 's your most dangerous game .
Yes .
My dear fellow , I intended to tell you last night ... but you know , Miss Trowbridge ...
You hunted him like an animal .
I know what you think , but you are wrong .
He was sober and fit for sport when I sent him out .
An hour or two strapped up in here brought him to his senses .
You raving maniac !
Yes , yes , yes . I 'll take it off ... when we 've finished .
The stupid fellow tried to escape through the swamps of Fog Hollow .
You see , when I first began stocking my island ... many of my guests thought I was joking ... so I established this trophy room .
I always bring them here before the hunt .
An hour with my trophies ... and they usually do their best to keep away from me .
Where do you get these poor devils ?
Providence provided my island with dangerous reefs .
But there are light buoys to mark the safe channel .
They do not always mark it .
- You shifted them .
- Precisely right .
Too bad your yacht should have suffered ... but at least it brought us together .
You take half-drowned men from ships you 've wrecked ... and drive them out to be hunted .
I give them every consideration ... good food , exercise ... everything to get them in splendid shape .
- To be shot down in cold blood .
- Oh , no , no .
Oh , I admit , with this annoying fellow ... but usually I give them hunting clothes ... a woodsman 's knife and a full day 's start .
I even wait until midnight to give them the full advantage the dark .
And if one eludes me only till sunrise ... he wins the game .
Suppose he refuses to be hunted .
Ivan is such an artist with these .
Invariably , Mr. Rainsford , invariably they choose to hunt .
And when they win ?
To date I have not lost .
Oh , Rainsford , you 'll find this game worth playing .
When the next ship arrives , we 'll have gorgeous sport together .
You murdering rat !
I 'm a hunter not an assassin .
Come , Rainsford .
Say you will hunt with me .
Hunt men ?
Say you will hunt with me !
No ?
What do you think I am ?
One , I fear , who dare not follow his own convictions ... to their logical conclusion .
I 'm afraid in this instance , Mr. Rainsford ... you may have to follow them .
What do you mean ?
I shall not wait for the next ship .
Four o 'clock .
The sun is just rising .
Come , Mr. Rainsford .
Let us not waste time .
Ivan .
Your fangs and claws , Mr. Rainsford .
Bob !
Bob !
Ivan .
Bob !
Bob , what are they going to do ?
- I 'm going to be hunted .
- Oh , no . No , Miss Trowbridge .
Outdoor chess .
His brain against mine .
His good craft against mine .
- And the prize ?
- The prize ?
You may recall what I said last evening .
Only after the kill ... does man know the true ecstasy of love .
Suppose you lose .
If I do not ...
What shall I say ?
... find you ... between midnight and sunrise tomorrow , freedom for both of you .
- I 'm going with you .
- No .
He 'll kill you too .
Not at all .
One does not kill a female animal .
If you lose , I can easily recapture her alive .
All right .
I 'll take her with me then .
We 'll set him a trail he 'll remember .
It 's only fair to advise you against Fog Hollow .
Outdoor chess , Mr. Rainsford .
Don 't lose your nerve .
We 'll beat this thing .
- The others didn 't .
- We will .
Come on . Let 's get going .
It seems as though we 've come miles .
Yeah , but three hours doesn 't take you far in this jungle .
Come on . Let 's keep going .
Come on .
Just a little more of this , then easy downhill going .
We 'll soon be safe .
No wonder he was so sure .
This island is no bigger than a deer park .
Oh , Bob !
Come on , now .
What are we going to do ?
We didn 't each live through a shipwreck to let this crazy man hunter worry us .
I shouldn 't have come with you .
You might beat him if you were alone .
Alone ?
And leave you here with that savage ?
Not a chance .
Now we 've got to think of something to worry him .
You 'd never get near him .
He 'd shoot on sight .
Weapons aren 't everything in the jungle .
Say , did you notice that leaning tree down there ?
- The one we just passed ? - Yes .
I want to show you something .
You see ?
If that supporting branch were cut away ... this fallen tree would make a perfect Malay deadfall .
A Malay deadfall ?
What 's that ?
A man-killing contraption the natives use .
It would stop that madman , all right .
Trouble is , it takes quite a few hours to build .
He said he wouldn 't follow till midnight .
That 's right .
If you help me , I think we 'll have time .
Come on .
We 'll cut some strong vines .
There .
Almost ready .
This bracelet of yours makes a fine guide ring for my necktie .
He 'll have been on his way almost an hour now .
Look out !
Don 't touch that trip line .
You 'll have a two-ton tree down on your back .
- Jungle wood 's as heavy as iron .
- Will it really work ?
I 've never known a living thing to get by one yet .
Look here .
You touch that trip line ... it 'll pull that trigger free .
Once that 's loose , there 's nothing to keep the log from coming down .
It 'll crash down and kill anything underneath it .
Look .
We 're ready .
Let him come .
Give me that knife .
Come out , Rainsford .
Why prolong it ?
I 'll not bungle this shot .
You 'll never even feel it .
But surely you don 't think that anyone who has hunted leopards ... would follow you into that ambush ?
Oh , very well . If you choose to play the leopard ... I shall hunt you like a leopard .
Wait .
Maybe it 's a trick .
Eve .
Why did he go ?
He 's playing with us ...
like a cat with a mouse .
What do you mean ?
You heard him say he 'd hunt us as he 'd hunt a leopard .
That means he 's gone for his high-powered rifle .
His rifle ?
Oh , Bob , we must get away from here !
- Run , quick !
- Eve , wait .
- No , I tell you , no !
- Don 't stop ! No !
Wait .
That 's Fog Hollow ahead .
- The swamp where he caught the others .
We haven 't a chance of keeping ahead of him there .
- But there 's no place else to run .
- That 's just what he 's counting on .
We 've got two hours till dawn .
We 've got to use our brains instead of our legs .
But he 'll have his rifle .
And we 'll have a man trap .
It makes me dizzy .
Cover this over .
When Mr. Zaroff falls down there , he 'll be all through hunting .
Quick .
Gather some leaves and grass .
I 'll cut some branches .
Yes .
Very good , Rainsford .
Very good .
You have not won yet .
Look at your watch .
Are you looking at it ?
Still half an hour till sunrise .
Swamp or no swamp , we can keep ahead of him that long .
As you are doubtless saying , the odds are against me .
You have made my rifle useless in the fog .
You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle .
Those animals I cornered ... now I know how they felt .
Achmed , Miss Trowbridge ... bring her here .
Now !
My dear Rainsford , I congratulate you .
You have beaten me .
Not yet .
Oh , but of course . I insist .
Why , you 're ...
You 're not even wounded .
You hit the dog not me .
I took a chance and went over with him .
A clever trick , Rainsford .
I cheerfully admit defeat .
Here 's the key of the boathouse .
The door is in the trophy room .
You and Miss Trowbridge may leave at once .
No !
Bob !
Eve !
The boat !
Impossible .
Trying to teach me a lesson in patience , Sir Joseph ?
Method is everything in archeology , my boy .
We always deal with our finds of the day in order .
Well , it seems to me that that box we dug up today , with the very peculiar gentleman , over there , is the only find we 've made in the past two months that 'll bring this expedition any medals from the British Museum .
We didn 't come to dig in Egypt for medals .
Much more is learned from studying bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds .
Our job is to increase the sum of human knowledge of the past , not to satisfy our own curiosity .
That 's all very true , Sir Joseph , but after all , we 're human .
And a find like this ...
Well , how can you wait ?
This is your first trip .
I 've been out here 10 years , and I 'm more curious about that mummy than you are , and even more about that box .
Whemple .
Yes ?
The viscera were not removed .
The usual scar made by the embalmer 's knife is not there .
I guessed as much , Muller .
I had a good look at him when I photographed him .
Never saw a mummy like that .
Neither , I imagine , has anyone else .
Looks as though he died in some sensationally unpleasant manner .
The contorted muscles show that he struggled in the bandages .
Buried alive .
" Imhotep ,
" High Priest of the Temple of the Sun at Karnak . "
Poor old fellow .
Now , what could you have done to make them treat you like that ?
An execution for treason , I suppose .
Sacrilege , more likely .
Look . The sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld have been chipped off of the coffin .
So Imhotep was sentenced to death not only in this world , but in the next .
Maybe he got too gay with the vestal virgins in the temple .
Possibly .
The priestesses of the Temple of Karnak were the daughters of the reigning pharaohs .
They were the sacred virgins of Isis .
Maybe the answer 's in that box we found buried with him .
I see I shall get no more work out of you until after it 's open .
Come on .
Let 's have the box up there .
The wood 's so rotten , it 'll fall apart at a touch .
Whatever it is , it 's terribly heavy .
Metal .
Looks like copper .
It 's gold .
I say !
Look here .
The unbroken seals of the Pharaoh Amenophis .
Some temple treasure .
" Death , eternal punishment " for anyone " who opens this casket ,
" in the name of Amon-Ra , " the King of the Gods . "
Good heavens !
What a terrible curse ! Well , let 's see what 's inside .
Wait !
You have read the curse .
We recognize your mastery of the occult sciences , Muller , but I can 't permit your beliefs to interfere with my work .
Then why did you send for me this afternoon ?
As a friend and an expert .
Because I saw this find was unique , and I wanted your opinion on it .
It is providential that you did .
Come , Dr. Muller .
Surely a few thousand years in the earth would take the mumbo-jumbo off any old curse .
I cannot speak before a boy .
Come out under the stars of Egypt .
Do not touch that casket .
Go on with your cataloging .
We 'll open it later .
You needn 't think you can persuade me not to examine the most wonderful find of my whole experience out here .
If you 're right about the legend , then this casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth from the holy of holies in the temple . And I can hardly wait to get back to find out .
The gods of Egypt still live in these hills , in their ruined temples .
The ancient spells are weaker , but some of them are still potent , and I believe that you have in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself , which contains the great spell by which Isis raised Osiris from the dead .
Put it back .
Bury it where you found it .
You have read the curse .
You dare defy it ?
In the interest of science , even if I believed in the curse , I 'd go on with my work for the museum .
Come back with me , and we 'll examine this great find together .
I cannot condone an act of sacrilege with my presence .
What 's the matter , man ?
For heaven 's sake , what is it ?
He ... He went for a little walk .
You should have seen his face .
Here 's something to break the monotony .
There 's a visitor coming up the trail from the Nile .
Color ?
Nationality ?
How could I see in that glare ?
Well , Whemple , back we go to London .
And what fools we look .
Money wasted . Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert .
A few beads , a few broken pots .
A man needs more than hard work for this game .
He needs flair .
He needs luck , like your father .
In the days when he used to come out here , there wasn 't so much competition .
When he did , he found things .
And once , 10 years ago , he found too much .
Was it 10 years ago ?
Queer story , that young Oxford chap he had with him going mad .
You know what I think it was ?
No .
What ?
I think he went crazy , bored beyond human endurance , messing around in this sand and these rocks .
He was laughing when your father found him . He died laughing , in a straitjacket .
Your father never explained .
But when the best excavator England has turned out , a man who loved Egypt , said he 'd never come back here , that meant something .
Come in .
You break your season 's camp , Professor Pearson ?
Your colleagues have returned to London ?
Yes .
Whemple and I stayed behind to clear up .
Your expedition has not been a success .
Scarcely .
Here are the season 's finds .
Permit me to present you with the most sensational find since that of Tutankhamen .
This is very sporting of you .
May I ask why ? We Egyptians are not permitted to dig up our ancient dead .
Only foreign museums .
Well , what 's this ?
Part of the funerary equipment of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon , daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent .
Yes .
It 's her name .
I found that not 100 yards from where we are .
You mean , you think her tomb is there ?
I will show you where to dig .
I 'm sure it 's very good of you , Mr ...
I didn 't catch your name .
Ardeth Bay .
Circumstantial evidence .
Not very strong , perhaps , but if we put that gang of diggers from Kerna on the job , we can tell in two days if there 's anything here .
In one day , Professor .
It 's a step !
He was right .
Anyhow , we found something .
The name of Anck-es-en-Amon .
We will cable your father in London .
He must be here when we examine this great find .
The seal of the seven jackals .
And it 's unbroken .
No one has entered this door since the priests of the royal necropolis sealed it .
3,700 years ago .
Is there a view like this in all the world , Helen ?
The real Egypt .
Are we really in this dreadful , modern Cairo ?
Your thoughts are far away from the dance and these nice English boys , my dear .
Not really .
I 'm having a lovely time .
I 'm so grateful .
But why ?
For your keeping me here with you , of course .
So I don 't have to go up to Father in that beastly hot Sudan .
It 's I who am grateful , my most interesting patient .
Know who that is ?
Muller of Vienna .
Really ?
Always spends his winters here .
Authority on the Egyptian occult .
Yes , but the girl .
Helen Grosvenor .
Her father 's Governor of the Sudan .
English , of course .
Her mother , Egyptian .
Some old family with a tree a mile long .
She 's staying here with Dr. and Mrs. Muller .
Pardon me , sir .
Our closing bell has rung .
I did not notice the time .
I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple ?
Yes .
I am Ardeth Bay .
Indeed !
Why , we have you to thank that we have this exhibit here at all .
The museum should be kept open all night in your honor .
Won 't you come down to my office ?
I 'm working here late .
Your pardon . I dislike to be touched .
An Eastern prejudice .
Won 't you sit down ?
You know my son .
Ardeth Bay .
Where did you disappear to when we opened the tomb ?
I returned to Cairo .
But ... But now I must not detain you .
But I must see you again .
You ... You must come to my house .
I regret I am too occupied to accept invitations .
He 's a strange one .
But you might at least have thanked the man .
He was responsible for finding the princess .
Yes .
I rather wish he hadn 't been .
I think it 's a dirty trick , this Cairo Museum keeping everything we 've found .
That was the contract .
The British Museum works for the cause of science , not for loot .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Is anything the matter ?
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Where do you want to go , miss ?
Le Musée des Antiquités .
Imhotep .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Imhotep .
I must get in .
Anck-es-en-Amon . I must .
It 's closed for the night .
Everybody 's gone home .
I must get in .
Imhotep . Imhotep .
What 's she saying ?
What language is that ?
The language of Ancient Egypt , not heard on this earth for 2,000 years .
And the name of a man unspoken since before the siege of Troy .
Is your master at home ?
Yes , efendi .
Tell him Dr. Muller wishes to see him , urgently .
How did I get here ?
We brought you here .
Father and I.
You fainted .
But how did you guess she was here ?
I discovered that she took a taxi from the hotel to the museum .
I went there .
The watchman said she had left in your car .
Before you take her away , I must talk to you about something she said just now .
Oh , Dr. Muller .
So , here you are , my dear .
I suppose you introduced yourself .
No ?
Miss Helen Grosvenor , my old friend Sir Joseph Whemple , Frank Whemple .
This seems so formal under these peculiar circumstances .
And now , if you 're all right again , back we go to the hotel .
I ... I think she ought to rest a few minutes .
Frank , will you make yourself agreeable ?
Well ...
Where was I when I fainted , Mr. Whemple ?
Oh , outside the museum .
What was I doing there ?
Well , I wouldn 't know that , would I ?
No , I don 't suppose you would .
I wish I did .
You see , I was waiting ...
Let 's not talk about it .
Oh , right .
You 're partly Egyptian , aren 't you ? Yes .
How did you guess that ?
Oh , I don 't know .
Just something about you .
You know , I 'd have liked Egypt better if I 'd met you there , but no such luck .
Stuck in the desert for two months , and was it hot !
That tomb !
What tomb ?
Surely you read about the princess .
So you did that .
Yes .
The 14 steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling .
But when we came to handle all her clothes and her jewels and her toilet things ...
You know , they buried everything with them that they used in life .
Well , when we came to unwrap the girl herself ...
How could you do that ?
Had to .
Science , you know .
Well , after we 'd worked among her things , I felt as if I 'd known her .
And when we got the wrappings off , and I saw her face ...
You 'll think me silly , but I sort of fell in love with her .
Do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with ?
I say !
Now I know what it is about you .
There was something about her head ...
I had never mentioned the name , yet I heard Miss Grosvenor mutter , in ancient Egyptian , something about Imhotep .
Imhotep ?
What was this Ardeth doing in the museum ?
Looking at the mummy , just at closing time .
Hello .
What ?
Come .
A museum guard found dead in the room of the princess .
So he died of shock .
We find this in dead guard 's hand , Sir Joseph .
Probably thief try to steal it .
Guard take it away , thief kill him .
The cause of death , I not find nothing .
Looks like an attempted theft , but nothing stolen here could be disposed of .
What is the document ?
Let me put this here .
You 'll be more comfortable .
Thanks .
You really want to know why I didn 't take you to the hospital ?
Because when I held you in my arms ...
Hadn 't you better not commit yourself ?
What girl could fail to make a conquest who collapsed at a man 's feet in the moonlight ?
Oh , I know it seems absurd when we 've known each other such a short time , but I 'm serious .
Don 't you think I 've had enough excitement for one evening , without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me ?
But I 've never been serious about this sort of thing before . Now , look here .
You can tell me to go to the devil , but you can 't laugh at me .
The curse has struck her , and now , through her , it will strike my son .
Quiet .
Frank , will you come to your father 's study ?
Helen , I shall take you home presently .
I 'll be back in a minute .
Imhotep was alive when that mummy in the museum was a vestal virgin in the temple .
Thirty-seven hundred years ago !
What 's that got to do with us , now ?
Your assistant , who went insane and died , as you might have done if you 'd seen what he saw , made a transcription of part of that scroll .
Yes .
I have it still .
You seem to think this thing has all the devils of Hell in it .
Why not burn it and be done with it ?
An excellent suggestion .
What became of the mummy of Imhotep ?
Somebody stole it .
Look here , Dr. Muller . What 's the matter with Miss Grosvenor ?
You still think that that mummy was stolen , Sir Joseph ?
Yes , I ...
Oh , I don 't know .
A thousand pardons .
I am Ardeth Bay .
I 'm Helen Grosvenor .
I called to see Sir Joseph .
He 's in the study . A conference ?
If I might perhaps wait .
Yes .
Of course .
Have we not met before , Miss Grosvenor ?
No , I don 't think so .
I don 't think one would forget meeting you , Ardeth Bay .
Then I am mistaken .
But you are of our blood .
As to that , I am not mistaken .
Yes .
My mother was Egyptian .
You must burn the Scroll of Thoth .
I tell you , it 's the museum 's property , not mine .
Who 's out there with Miss Grosvenor ?
Ardeth Bay .
He 's come for the scroll .
Ardeth Bay , Dr. Muller .
I accept your invitation , but I find no solitary student with his books .
I fear my visit is inopportune .
On the contrary , we were just talking about ...
Me ?
Your native Egypt .
You know Miss Grosvenor ?
Ardeth Bay introduced himself .
Won 't you be seated ?
Sir Joseph was just wondering how you knew where the tomb of the Princess Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden .
Partly inference , partly chance .
Sir Joseph , you seem disturbed .
Yes .
A tragedy at the museum after you left .
Tragedy ?
When I was there ?
When you were there , Miss Grosvenor ?
Yes .
They told me I went there and tried to get in after it was closed .
I don 't remember , but ...
Helen , it is very late .
Frank , will you please see Helen back to the hotel ?
Certainly , if Miss Grosvenor will let me .
But I don 't want to go .
After what happened , you need rest badly .
But I don 't .
I was tired , but I ...
Why , I 've never felt so alive before .
Then as your doctor , I must order you to go .
I 'm not a child .
Yes . Please , come .
Then , Ardeth Bay , au revoir .
But we must see each other again .
I shall be honored .
An unusual crime .
A guard killed by a man who left a gift to the museum .
A gift ?
A scroll .
Part of which was transcribed when it was first found .
Here is the transcription .
I cannot read the writing of a period so remote .
But you read the name of Anck-es-en-Amon on that piece of pottery .
That was of the 18th Dynasty .
These are Predynastic ideographs .
The scroll from which this was copied was stolen 10 years ago , together with the mummy of the High Priest Imhotep .
Most interesting .
May I see that scroll , Sir Joseph ?
We left it at the museum .
So .
I have something else to show you .
A photograph .
Why do you show all this to me ?
Do you think it conceivable that the mummy was not stolen , but restored to a semblance of life by the spell from the Scroll of ...
That scroll is my property .
I bought it from a dealer .
It is here in this house .
I presume in that room .
We had foreseen this .
The scroll is in safe hands , and will be destroyed the minute it is known that harm has come to us .
You have studied our ancient arts , and you know that you cannot harm me .
You also know that you must return that scroll to me or die .
Now tell that weak fool to get that scroll , wherever it is , and hand it to his Nubian servant .
The Nubian !
The ancient blood .
So you have made him your slave .
If I could get my hands on you , I 'd break your dried flesh to pieces .
But your power is too strong .
This is the evil force that has been attacking her .
Burn the scroll , man .
Burn it !
It was through you this horror came into existence .
It 's true . It 's true .
Your father destroyed the scroll , knowing that it would cost him his life .
What 's that ?
Isis , the Egyptian symbol of life .
I meant it for your father .
What good could that old charm have done him ?
I tell you , the doctors say it 's a plain case of heart failure .
The Nubian is missing .
He 's an old servant .
He was frightened , but he 'll be back .
Don 't try and make me believe that this Ardeth fellow is a mummy come to life .
It was that idea and the horror of it that killed my father .
The museum guard died of natural causes , too .
Frank , I need your help .
I saw your attraction to my patient last night , and hers to you .
Hers to me ?
Do you really think so ?
And I welcomed it .
But do you think I have a chance ?
'Cause I think she 's the most ...
But this is terrible at a time like this . Frank , I 'm afraid .
Will you go with me to her now ?
Yes .
Then telephone her first not to leave the hotel .
9-5-9-0 .
No , I 'm not going out .
Yes , I promise to wait until you get here .
Goodbye .
And I 'm so dreadfully sorry .
What were you doing , Doctor ?
Your father did not burn the Scroll of Thoth .
That creature has it now . But the ashes in the fireplace .
They were newspaper .
The scroll is papyrus .
Then it was murder .
The Nubian .
Wear this around your neck .
Why ?
When we fight this creature , we must ask protection from the forces of old that it defied .
I 'll give it to Helen .
She 's the one that needs protection . No .
Her life is not in danger .
It is her soul .
Should love for you come to her , he will try to destroy you .
That amulet , the Egyptians believe , was a charm against evil sendings such as struck down your father .
Your dog is frightened .
My servant will see to him .
Sit down , Miss Grosvenor .
Ancient Egypt .
Nothing modern .
What a strange incense .
Is it not familiar to you ?
No .
Our forefathers used it .
Yours and mine .
You will not remember what I show you now , and yet I shall awaken memories of love and crime and death .
I knelt by the bed of death .
Thy father 's last farewell .
I knew the Scroll of Thoth could bring thee back to life .
I dared the gods ' anger and stole it .
I stole back to thy tomb to bring thee back to life .
I murmured the spell that raises the dead , but they broke in upon me and found me doing an unholy thing .
Thy father condemned me to the nameless death .
The scroll he ordered buried with me , that no such sacrilege might disgrace Egypt again .
A nameless grave .
The slaves were killed so that none should know .
The soldiers who killed them were also slain , so no friend could creep to the desert with funeral offerings for my condemned spirit .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
My love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods .
No man ever suffered as I did for you .
But the rest you may not know .
Not until you are about to pass through the great night of terror and triumph , until you are ready to face moments of horror for an eternity of love .
Until I send back your spirit that has wandered through so many forms and so many ages .
But before then , Bast must again send forth death .
Death to that boy for whom love is creeping into your heart .
Love that would keep you from myself .
Love that might bring sickness and even death to you .
Awake .
Have I been asleep ?
I had strange dreams .
Dreams of Ancient Egypt , I think . There was someone like you in them .
My pool is sometimes troubled .
One sees strange fantasies in the water , but they pass like dreams .
My dog ! Wolfram !
Wolfram !
Where is he ?
Helen .
Helen , where have you been ?
We 've been so worried .
We 've hunted everywhere .
In the museum again ?
Yes .
Muller 's down in the Arab quarter now . Well , if I must give an explanation , it was stuffy in here .
I can 't be shut up all the time .
Besides , I don 't like the feeling that I 'm always being watched .
I took the dog with me .
He 's ... He 's dead .
But how ?
I don 't know .
Where ?
I don 't remember .
But I can see it now , standing on poor Wolfram 's back , a white cat .
A white cat ? The cat goddess , Bast .
Yes , there was a statue of Bast .
The goddess of evil sendings !
Just what happened ?
Try to remember , Helen .
I don 't want to remember .
Besides , I don 't see that it 's any affair of yours . Oh , but it is .
We know that you were with Ardeth Bay .
Oh , Helen .
Helen , I love you . I 'm trying to help you and protect you .
We all are .
Don 't let me go again .
I 'll try to get away , but you mustn 't let me , no matter what I do or what I say .
There 's death there for me , and life for something else inside me that isn 't me .
But it 's alive , too , and fighting for life .
Save me from it , Frank .
Save me . Oh , everything 's going to be all right .
Now that you 've asked for help , I 'll never leave you alone .
I 'll get Mrs. Muller down here with you , and I 'll stay here till the doctor comes .
And then , we 'll take you to my house .
Oh , Helen , it 's been such torture .
I love you so .
I don 't like that doctor .
Please go in there and find out what he 's saying about me .
I will , my dear . He 'll know just what 's the matter with you , and cure you .
Now , don 't worry .
Now , Miss Sparling , help me to get dressed and get out of here .
It 's come over you again , Miss Grosvenor .
I must escape .
I 'm being held here .
You must help me . But you told me when these fits came on , I wasn 't to listen .
I have a friend .
He 's rich .
He 'll give you money .
Now you just lie down again .
You know you mustn 't get up .
Well , if you don 't want money , what do you want most ? He 'll give you anything , if only you 'll help me to go to him .
You want me to call Dr. Muller ?
No .
I hate him .
I 'll die if I don 't get away from him .
Now , Miss Grosvenor ...
It 's killing me .
Do you hear ? Please , please ! Now , Helen , you must not do this again .
You 're always so exhausted afterwards .
She 's too weak to be removed , except to a hospital .
I insist on keeping her here under our direct observation .
But Dr. LeBarron , you haven 't told us what to do for her .
She 's getting weaker every day . You know that negligee I bought in Paris ?
Help me to put it on , and bring me my toilet things .
I want some color .
I want to look well .
But you can 't do that , my dear .
They 'd never allow it .
The nurse would be ...
I know .
We 'll get rid of her .
This is a plot , just between us .
I want to look the way I did .
Just a surprise , for Frank .
And I want you to bring him to me .
You understand ? In short , I have failed to make a diagnosis .
Medical science is helpless in a case like this .
Frank .
Go to her , and don 't be angry with me .
Oh , but Helen , you shouldn 't have done this .
They shouldn 't have let you .
Just this once .
Perhaps the last time .
But you 're going to get well .
Then I know I can make you love me .
I do love you , Frank .
And I 'm trying to prove it , because I 'd rather die than live and lose you .
But you 're going to live .
We 're not going to lose each other .
So , my dear ...
Don 't scold me .
Just feminine vanity .
I wanted to look my best again . So you know more than I realized you knew .
What do you mean ?
These impulses to go to him .
The pull is too strong to withstand and live .
Helen knows . She knows the moment she stops struggling , he will give her back her strength to come to him .
But I don 't want to lose my own mind and be someone else , someone I hate .
My dear , while you were growing worse , we tried to find him and failed .
The next time the call comes , go to him .
Muller , what can we do now ?
We can do no more .
Ardeth has beaten me . The next time he draws her to him , we must follow her .
And then ?
I 've given her some bromide .
She 's asleep now .
I 'll go to bed .
All right .
I 'll wait here till Dr. Muller comes .
Good night . Good night .
Where are we ?
This is my bed , but this is not the temple nor my father 's palace .
Do not look , Anck-es-en-Amon .
Do not be afraid .
I was afraid . When you were kneeling beside my bed , a veil came over my eyes .
Darkness . Your last memory is of me in the hour of your death as I knelt by your bed , 3,700 years ago .
No man has ever suffered for woman as you suffered for me .
And now that the gods have forgiven us ...
No , no , not yet .
Your soul is in a mortal body , renewed many times since we loved in Thebes of old .
But that love is not for us again until the great change .
I do not understand .
Look .
Look and wonder .
Figure of myself .
It is my coffin , made by my father against my death .
What mummy has usurped my eternal resting place ?
It is thy dead shell .
I tried then to raise this body . I could raise it now .
But it would be a mere thing that moved at my will , without a soul .
It was not only this body that I loved .
It was thy soul . I destroy this lifeless thing .
Thou shalt take its place but for a few moments , and then rise again , even as I have risen .
Come .
Imhotep , this is the place of embalmment .
It is not lawful for me , a priestess of Isis , to see or touch an unclean thing .
Come to the altar of Anubis , the guide of the dead .
The time has come for the final prayers .
The ancient rites must be performed over thy body .
Then I will read the great spell with which Isis brought Osiris back from the grave .
And thou shalt rise again .
No .
No , I 'm alive !
I 'm young ! I won 't die !
I loved you once , but now you belong with the dead .
I am Anck-es-en-Amon , but I ... I 'm somebody else , too .
I want to live , even in this strange new world .
For thy sake I was buried alive .
I ask of thee only a moment of agony .
Only so can we be united .
The bath of natron .
You shall not plunge my body into that !
Let me go !
Let me go !
Don 't kill me !
I 'm a priestess of Isis !
Save me from that mummy !
It 's dead ! Save me !
I no longer fear you .
Do with me what you will .
Frank !
She 's gone to him .
Now I know his horrible plan .
He 's going to kill her and make her a living mummy , like himself .
The gods will receive into the underworld the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon .
But not for long .
Osiris will release thy soul .
You shall rest from life , like the setting sun in the West .
But you shall dawn anew in the East as the first rays of Amon-Ra dispel the shadows .
Look !
Come on !
Frank ! Frank !
Helen !
Oh , Isis !
Holy Maiden !
I was thy consecrated vestal .
I broke my vows .
Save me now ! Teach me the ancient summons , the holy spells I 've forgotten .
I call upon thee as of old !
Helen .
Call her .
He has dragged her back to Ancient Egypt .
Call her !
Her love for you may bridge the centuries . Helen . Helen !
Come back .
Come back .
Here 's a toast to you , Paul .
You 've torn my Pierre away from his books and made him enjoy himself for once .
Oh , don 't thank Paul .
It was for you I came .
Then I must drink a toast to Camille .
Oh , no , Paul .
You 've had four glasses already .
That 's nothing .
For last year 's carnival night , I had 14 .
Dupin , Paul !
Look at the Arab dancers .
This way .
This way .
See the naughty nautch nymphs .
The adorable Arab angels .
Come , we must continue our studies of anatomy .
Yeah , much nicer than ... than visiting a morgue .
... marvelous performance of dancing .
We have Lady Fatima !
Lady Fatima 's snake imitations ...
Do they bite ?
Oh , yes , but you have to pay extra for that .
Mignette , do you think you could learn to do that dance for me ?
No .
No ?
Well , then ...
I guess I 'll have to join the show .
See , Pierre , how brown they are .
Is that their real color , do you suppose , or have they painted themselves ?
Shall I find out for you ?
Don 't you dare .
Introducing
Col. Ha-ha from America !
Ho ... ho ... ho !
Bloodthirsty savages from the wilds of America !
Ha ... ha ... ha !
See the redskins scalp their victim .
First time in Paris .
They are Apaches , my friends , Apaches .
Like our own waterfront rats . Just as wild .
That 'd be a good name for our bandits .
Apaches .
Ha , Apaches , why , splendid .
Would you like to try whether they are real ?
I ?
And leave you unprotected ?
Never .
Oh , Pierre .
Let 's go in there .
Attention , attention , ladies and gentlemen .
Step closer .
Closer .
Behind this curtain is the strangest creature your eyes will ever behold .
Erik , the ape-man !
The monster who walks upright and speaks a language even as you and I.
The ruler of the jungle , whose giant hands can tear a man in half .
Erik , the ape-man .
The beast with a human soul .
More cunning than a man and stronger than a lion .
Step up , ladies and gentlemen . Step right in .
Shall we go into this one ?
All right .
Soldiers and children , half-price !
Step up , ladies and gentlemen .
Don 't miss this opportunity .
That 's good . Let 's go down there .
Oh ! Let 's sit over there , love .
No , mademoiselle , not there .
Take a seat in front so that you can see everything .
This gorilla killed six men , you see .
What a funny-looking man .
He 's a show in himself .
Did you notice his accent ?
I wonder where he comes from .
I never heard an accent like it .
Silence .
I 'm Dr. Mirakle , messieurs , mesdames .
And I am not the sideshow charlatan .
So if you expect to witness the usual carnival hocus-pocus , just go to the box office and get your money back .
I am not exhibiting a freak , a monstrosity of nature ,
but a milestone in the development of life .
The shadow of Erik , the ape hangs over us all .
The darkness before the dawn of man .
It 's all right . Don 't be afraid .
It 's only a baboon .
I-I 'm not afraid .
Neither am I.
Listen to him , brothers and sisters .
He is speaking to you .
Can you understand what he says or have you forgotten ?
I have re-learned his language .
Listen .
I will translate what he says .
My home is in the African jungle , where I lived with my father and my mother and my brothers and sisters .
But I was captured by a band of hairless white apes
and carried away to a strange land .
I 'm in the prime of my strength .
And I am lonely .
Here is the story of man .
In the slime of chaos there was the seed that rose and grew into the tree of life .
Life was motion .
Fins changed into wings .
Wings into ears .
Crawling reptiles grew legs .
Eons of ages passed .
There came a time when a four-legged thing walked upright .
Behold , the first man .
Heresy !
Heresy ?
Heresy ?
Do they still burn men for heresy ?
Then burn me , monsieur .
Light the fire .
Do you think your little candle will outshine the flame of truth ?
Do you think these boards and curtains are my whole life ?
They are only a trap to catch the pennies of fools .
My life is consecrated to a great experiment .
I tell you , I will prove your kinship with the ape .
Erik 's blood shall be mixed with the blood of man .
What does he mean ?
I wish I knew .
Mesdames et messieurs if any of you wish to make the acquaintance of Erik , come forward .
There 's no need to be afraid .
He is behind bars and cannot hurt you .
Let 's go up .
Oh , no , Pierre , I 'm afraid .
I 'm not afraid .
He likes you , Camille .
Look , he wants your bonnet .
Erik is only human , mademoiselle .
He has an eye for beauty .
You have made a conquest , mademoiselle .
Pierre !
Erik !
Erik , get back !
You fool , do you want to be killed ?
Oh , but he has ruined your bonnet .
I will replace it , mademoiselle .
I will send you a new bonnet with Erik 's compliments .
Will you tell me where you live and what your name is ?
Never mind , monsieur . It was an accident .
But I insist .
Where do you live , my child ?
It is not necessary , monsieur .
Come , dear .
Follow her .
I must know where she lives .
You liked her , didn 't you , Erik ?
Sweetheart .
Have I ever told you that I love you ?
Camille , I love you .
Let me look at you .
You 're like a flower , soft and fragrant .
Pure and beautiful .
Darling .
And you 're like a star , too .
A white morning star .
And your hair , it 's full of stardust .
You 're like a song the girls of Provence sing on May Day .
And like the dancing in Normandy on May Day .
And like the wine in Burgundy on May Day .
Oh , Camille , I love you .
And I love you , too , Pierre .
No !
No ! No !
No !
A lady in distress ?
Who are you ?
Come with me .
Where ?
My carriage .
No !
No !
Why are you trembling at my touch ?
Your hand is cold .
It chills me .
Come .
I will help you .
No .
Come .
Be patient .
Are you in pain , mademoiselle ?
It will only last a little longer .
Ah , you are stubborn .
Hush !
It will only last one more minute , then we shall see .
We shall know if you are to be the pride of science !
Oh , hush , hush !
Now , mademoiselle .
Now .
The clots .
The black spots .
Rotten blood !
You .
Your blood is rotten .
Black as your sins .
You cheated me .
Your beauty was a lie .
Dead ?
You are ...
You 're dead .
Janos , Janos .
Get rid of it .
Get it away .
Will my search ever end ?
Three this week .
Three .
Women , all of them .
Life is hard .
The river is kind .
The river is soft .
It rocks them to sleep .
And asks no pay .
Three women .
Always small .
Always young .
A man ?
A woman .
Age ?
Oh , any , 1,000 or 30 .
Cause of death ?
Drowning .
Profession ?
Yes .
Identification ?
None , she was naked .
Number 13 .
Well , Monsieur Dupin , what brings you here so late ?
The two women .
What about them ?
Monsieur , would you be good enough to show them to me once more ?
If you wish , Monsieur Dupin , I will show you three .
Three ?
You mean , there 's been another one ?
Yes .
Let me see her .
Yes .
There 's the body .
The same marks .
Marks ?
See them ?
They 're on the others , too .
Monsieur , you must let me take a specimen of this woman 's blood .
Impossible .
Since that whole body disappeared last week , the inspector is very strict about medical students .
Then you bring it to me .
It 's against all regulations .
Tomorrow night , huh ?
Good night , monsieur .
The macaroni 's ready .
And the coffee 's getting cold .
Aren 't you going to eat your lunch ?
You give five francs to that old ghoul down at the morgue and ... and I have to turn magician and pull a loaf of bread out of my nose so we can eat .
Dupin , you might at least have the decency to come to the table .
Pierre ?
Why don 't you go down to the morgue and live there , instead of making a morgue out of our home .
Vampire .
Vulture .
Body snatcher .
Say something .
Come in .
Speak of the devil .
Good morning , monsieur .
You 've got it , eh ?
Yes , monsieur , I 've got it .
But who knows , at the price of my job , perhaps .
I am a married man , monsieur .
I have children .
And if the police should even suspect that I was holding anything back from them , I should be put behind bars .
No use , no use , we haven 't a centime .
Yes , monsieur . I must owe you the money .
The morgue must give us credit .
Then , I will trust you .
Monsieur , the Morgue Keeper , perhaps you have an extra slab for my friend here .
Why not take him in ?
He eats nothing , he doesn 't talk .
He never changes his position .
I 'm sure he 'd make you a very fine tenant .
I 'll pack his things and send them down .
You don 't live badly here , monsieur .
I had to hurry myself up here without lunch .
And now you have to hurry back for your lunch .
Boy , that 's too bad .
Good appetite to you and your quiet guests .
Goodbye .
Good day , monsieur .
If you 'd pay half as much attention to your studies as you do to this nonsense , what grades you 'd get .
What did you find out ?
After the carnival last night , I performed an autopsy .
The victim didn 't die of drowning .
There was no water in her lungs .
Oh , so that 's what you were up to .
I thought you were with Camille .
Of what did the victim die ?
Paul , here it is again .
What ?
The same foreign substance in the blood of each victim .
Look , Paul .
All three died from the same cause .
Some strange poison perhaps .
Something introduced into the blood streams that caused their death .
What could it be ?
I don 't know .
That 's what I have to find out .
Oh , Pierre , you must pull yourself together .
Why , you 're becoming fanatical .
Look at yourself in the mirror .
Your eyes are getting glassy .
Just like that old charlatan 's .
Dr. Mirakle , eh ?
What did you make of him ?
Oh , he 's a faker .
Did you pay attention to what he said ?
You mean about us being the product of evolution ?
Yes . Hmm .
Has it occurred to you that he might be right ?
Eat your lunch .
Dr. Mirakle .
He 's a strange man .
Pierre !
Mother .
Mother !
See what the concierge has just brought up .
Mother , come quickly .
I 'm coming . I 'm coming .
For pity 's sake , what is it ?
What are you so excited about ?
See what just came .
A new bonnet .
A bonnet !
Oh , it 's lovely .
Are you sure it 's for you ?
My name 's on the box .
Isn 't it pretty ?
Oh , now , who could have sent it ?
Maybe it 's from Pierre .
Oh , where would Pierre get money enough to get a present like that ?
Maybe there 's a card inside the box .
It 's from Dr. Mirakle .
And who is Dr. Mirakle ?
You know , I told you .
The funny old man at the sideshow who owns the ape .
Oh , I see .
The ape took your bonnet , and the gentleman 's replacing it .
Well , that 's very nice of him .
It 's a beautiful bonnet .
Shall I wear it to the picnic ?
Why not ?
I wonder how he found out where we lived .
But didn 't you tell him ?
He wanted to know .
But Pierre wouldn 't let me tell him .
That 's funny .
Well , anyway , you have a new hat .
Camille ?
Camille ?
There they are .
Hello .
Ah , there she is .
Everybody , ready . One , two . ~ Her father wanted her to wed a funny ~
~ funny little man ~
~ Her mother wanted her to wed a funny ~
~ funny little man ~
~ My father wanted me to wed a funny ~
~ funny little man ~
~ But I would not be wed , I said ~
~ to such a funny little man ~ ~
Come , fair maiden .
Yon charger champs at the bit .
Come on , Camille .
Hurry up ! Hurry up !
Did you bring the chicken ?
~ But she would not be seen she said ~
~ with such a funny little man ~
~ But she would not be seen she said ~
~ with such a funny little man ~ ~
Florette , I am absolutely mad about you .
No , no , no .
Years ago I gave up believing in students .
But , Marie , I mean what I say .
And here 's to a truthful student , though the animal doesn 't exist .
But , Mignette , I give you my word .
You will speak to my parents tonight ?
But it 's you I love , Susette , not your family .
Don 't I look different to you today ?
Different ?
How ?
You 're a blind donkey .
Something new I 've got on .
It 's my bonnet .
Oh , of course , it 's beautiful .
And it 's a gift .
A gift ? Well , well .
Who from ?
Guess .
Honoré , that poet .
Guess again .
That butterfly collector , Moreau ?
Oh , Pierre , you 'd better give up .
It 's from Dr. Mirakle .
Mirakle ?
Mirakle .
Yes .
Wasn 't it nice of him ?
Did he bring it himself ?
No , but he sent a note .
So he found out where you live , after all .
And I can 't imagine how .
He must have had us followed .
What did the note say ?
He asked me to come to his tent tonight .
That 's strange .
What could he want ?
You mustn 't go .
Why not ?
I wonder what Dr. Mirakle is up to .
Paul calls him a faker , but he isn 't .
He isn 't an ordinary man .
I 'll go see your Dr. Mirakle tonight .
Very well , Pierre .
Get them poles down to the hallway .
Move this box back .
Come on . Come on . Come on .
What 's the matter , Erik ?
Are you restless ?
Be quiet .
What is the matter ?
So , we have a caller .
Dr. Mirakle ...
No show tonight , young man .
The carnival is over .
I 've already seen your performance Doctor .
I wanted to talk to you .
First , the young lady to whom you sent the hat wants me to thank you for her .
Then she is not coming ?
She sends her regrets .
Very well .
Good night .
Are you going away ?
Yes .
We move to Munich in the morning .
Excuse me . I must attend to my work .
I 'm a medical student .
And the things you said in your lecture were very interesting .
Have you experimented , Doctor ?
Yes .
Have you written any papers ?
None to be shown .
I had hoped you would let me come to see you .
Have you a house in Paris ?
No .
I sleep here .
This tent is my home .
Good night , young man .
No , no .
That 's Dr. Mirakle 's stuff .
He 's not going with us .
He 's going to stay in Paris .
Load off .
Pull ahead .
All right , go in the corner .
Erik .
Erik .
Let me get this for you .
He got out with the ape , and I 'll swear they were talking to each other .
They went inside , and after that there was no sign of life .
Not a sound .
So you went home ?
Well , I dropped in at the morgue .
Pierre .
Pierre , what will you come to ?
Why are you always visiting that horrid old place ?
Don 't you worry , darling .
Look .
There 's all of our Paris , spread out before us .
I like to see the little lighted windows , twinkling like stars .
Wouldn 't it be fun to know all that was going on inside those houses ?
Perhaps it 's just as well that we don 't know .
Think of what all those walls are hiding .
Broken hopes and bodies and hearts .
Absent dreams .
Starvation , madness .
Crimes of the streets .
And tragedies of the river .
Paris . My city .
I hate to leave you alone tonight .
Hold me tightly , Pierre .
I could hold you forever , Camille .
Good night , dear .
Good night , Pierre .
By the way , you always keep your door bolted at night , don 't you ?
Not always , Pierre .
Be sure and lock it tonight , dear .
Will you promise ?
If you say so .
Good night .
Good night , dear .
Good night , mother .
Pierre ?
Yes .
Mademoiselle , you will pardon the late hour .
But I had to see you .
What do you want , monsieur ?
Don 't be alarmed , mademoiselle .
I 'm leaving Paris tonight .
And there is something I have to tell you .
May I come in ?
Oh no , monsieur .
My mother has gone to sleep .
My carriage is downstairs , mademoiselle .
We can drive to a café and talk .
Oh , that 's impossible .
But it is of greatest importance .
Please go away .
Mademoiselle , you must come .
Please .
Do me this favor .
Let me close the door , or I 'll call for help .
But I have a message for you from Erik .
He talks only of you .
He can 't forget you .
There is something you must know .
Are you insane , monsieur ?
Erik !
Erik !
There , Erik .
She 's up there .
Gorilla .
Gorilla .
Paul , Paul , Paul , wake up . Wake up .
What 's ... What 's the matter ?
What ?
I 've found it .
It 's the blood of a gorilla .
Gorilla ?
Those women , don 't you understand ?
They died because a gorilla 's blood was injected into their veins .
Camille !
Camille !
Oh , darling , what is it ?
What 's the matter ?
Tell me , what happened to you , please ?
I 'll get you a glass of water .
Oh , my baby !
Mother .
Camille !
Camille !
Camille !
Mother .
Hurry up .
Give the man a hand .
Someone help me break it down , please .
Help ! Help !
Help !
What have you got ?
What is it , violence ?
What do you think ?
Money . Jewels .
This is not a robbery .
And there 's no body , so it isn 't a murder .
He 's carried her away .
She 's gone .
Who are you ?
Where do you come from ?
He 's her sweetheart .
He ... He comes here every night .
Ah-ha .
Sweetheart .
You may wait for the prefect .
But we must find Camille .
Let me go , you fool !
It 'll be too late .
You may tell all that to the prefect .
Now , what is your name ?
Pierre Dupin .
Now , where do you live ?
Oh , don 't you understand ?
Her life is in danger .
I understand .
Where do you live ?
Oh , you fool .
You stupid fool !
So , your name is Victor Albert Adolph
Jules Hugo Louis Duborg ?
Yes , sir .
Why did you not investigate when you heard the first scream ?
I ... I was afraid .
Stupid , incredibly stupid .
Yes , sir . I ...
Stupid .
What is your name and business ?
I am Franz Odenheimer . I own a restaurant .
Odenheimer .
In your own way , tell us what happened .
You see , I was just going to bed .
Then suddenly , I heard a scream .
Right away , I ran across the street .
And I was one of the first ones to enter this room .
On the way upstairs , I heard a voice .
And that voice was speaking Italian .
Do you speak Italian ?
No .
Were you ever in Italy ?
No .
How do you know it was Italian ?
Because I am sure it was Italian .
Thank you , sir .
Alberto Montani .
What do you know of this affair ?
Well , I , I also heard the voice .
But it was not Italian .
I 'm Italian . I speak Italian .
When I ran up the stairs with the others , I heard the voice .
It 's not Italian , no .
It was Danish .
Do you speak Danish ?
No .
Were you ever in Denmark ?
No .
How do you know it was Danish ?
My intuition .
It was not Danish . Oh .
I beg your pardon , Your Honor .
I am a native of Denmark .
Danish is my native tongue .
I heard the voice , but it was not Danish . It was German .
Italian , not German .
Danish .
German .
I say it was German .
Silence !
Italian .
Danish .
German .
Silence .
Bring in the young man .
Monsieur , the prefect will question you now .
Now , you might as well come quietly .
Don 't try and make any more trouble .
Young man , what is your name ?
My na ...
Oh , I can tell you who committed the murder and where you can find him .
Who ?
An ape .
He 's out of his mind .
If you don 't listen to me now , you 'll be guilty of the second murder .
Second murder ?
So you know there has been one ?
Yeah .
If you 'll only listen to me , I 'll explain .
Very well , tell us what you know .
There were two women in this room .
The only door was locked and bolted .
Everybody heard screams and the sound of a terrible struggle .
Within two minutes , the door was broken down .
No one was here .
One of those women was carried away .
I tell you , the other one was murdered .
And her body must be somewhere in this room .
Mother .
Young man , you know too much .
I arrest you for the murder of ...
Yes , and another murder may be happening now .
It 's a confession you wish to make ?
No . An accusation .
Dr. Mirakle in the Rue Morgue is guilty of four murders so far this week .
And by now , perhaps a fifth .
Do you accuse this doctor ?
Dr. Mirakle has a captive ape .
It committed this crime .
No one man could have done this .
Three men couldn 't have pushed that body up the chimney .
I tell you that ape killed her .
And carried her daughter off through the window .
You 're insane .
Come on .
Wait !
Here is proof .
That is not human .
It 's the hair of an ape .
Ape .
Her blood is perfect .
That 's the house , monsieur .
Open .
This is an empty house .
No one lives here .
But it 's not empty , I tell you .
We must break in .
There 's another door at the side .
We 'll try it .
Police .
I cannot stop now .
Hold them off , until I am ready .
Come , Erik .
Erik .
Erik .
Back into your cage !
Back to your cage . Erik .
Somebody 's barring it .
Open . In the name of the law , open !
Hurry !
Camille ?
He 's dead .
Why , look ! There it goes .
It 's an ape !
You fool !
Pierre !
Pierre !
Camille .
Name ?
Mirakle , I believe , or something like that .
Number 2 .
Number 2 .
Age ?
Oh , any age . It doesn 't matter .
Profession ?
They say he was a scientist or something .
Death caused by ?
An ape .
if i had my way you would never grow old and sunshine i 'd bring every day first door to your left , dearie .
i haven 't made one of these since the 4th of july .
I was making one when the quake hit frisco .
Believe me , friend , i wouldn 't go to all this trouble for any of these foreigners .
Oop , oop , you got to wait a minute and let the oil sink in .
There you are , partner .
You can tell your grandchildren about that one .
Say , what in the name of - why , i 'm so sorry .
I 'm so glad .
Such a beautiful drink , too .
Yes , paradise cocktail .
Seem to be a few drops left .
Always the most precious , the last few drops .
That 's luck .
Yes .
My name is dan .
Mine 's joan .
Hello , joan .
Hello , dan .
May we , uh , drink to our meeting ?
We should .
Here 's ... here 's hail and farewell .
Well , that seems a bit ruthless .
Let 's say auf wiedersehen .
- Auf wiedersehen . Auf wiedersehen .
Auf wiedersehen .
And so .
Please , shall i introduce you to my friends ?
I think not .
Luck has allowed us a few drops of a paradise cocktail .
Another would have destroyed the charm .
You 're right .
Let 's trust luck will come again .
Known him long ?
Ever so long .
Where ?
I ... i can 't quite remember .
Better skip a few cocktails , darling .
Come on , everybody , how about a little drink to joan ?
Joan , we 're drinking to you .
To joan .
It 's been a long chase , dan .
Yes .
What detained you ?
Never mind the wisecracks .
Still on the garlic , huh ?
Well , nevertheless , it looks like you 're out of luck this time .
Apparently .
Come on !
Okay , you win .
I always win .
If you try to pull another break like that on me , i 'll deliver you in a basket .
Let 's go .
Well , now what ?
A boat and then , uh , san quentin .
Can i get my clothes ?
Well , they 're on the boat .
Considerate .
Yeah .
You know , i thought i 'd ditched you way back in berlin .
When i left frisco , the chief said to me ,
" steve , don 't come back alone , "
and he knew i wouldn 't .
I 'll be a son of a sea cow .
Well , if it ain 't the light-fingered skippy .
- Hi , dan .
- Hello , skippy .
So this is your hideout .
Hong kong must be pretty soft .
I like it fine .
Yeah , well , you better walk around that u.s.a. Of america like it was a swamp .
It 's getting so a guy can 't go nowheres nowadays without bumping into all sorts of people .
Butte wants you . Detroit wants you . Sacramento wants you .
I 'm wanted everywhere and welcome nowhere .
I 'm just a vagabond .
Oh , that 's too bad .
You can 't win all the time .
Come on .
Anything i can do for you here , dan ?
You might poison him .
Hey , flatfoot , tell those bulls i 'm an alien !
The stateroom is like a turkish bath .
Thanks for the outing .
Oh , i couldn 't stand it myself .
Thanks anyhow .
Hey , how long - the cuffs ?
I 'm taking no chances .
They broke five of my pals when you escaped .
Well , that wasn 't right . They did all they could .
They were shooting at me for three blocks .
Yeah , well , it 's lucky for you i wasn 't among them .
Yes .
Undoubtedly .
I may as well tell you now , i 'm not such a good sailor .
- Get seasick , huh ?
- Mm-hmm . Well , you better enjoy everything while you can - good or bad .
I suppose that includes being harnessed to you , garlic and all .
Well , anyway , you better stand it and like it .
I 'm afraid i can 't agree to like it .
Suppose the ship were to sink .
Imagine my embarrassment to be found dead anchored to you .
This ship ain 't gonna sink .
Oh , they 've been known to .
Well , listen , sucker , when it does , i 'll make you a little present of this .
When i was a kid , i used to swim around a pier like that .
Remember your kid swimming days ?
No .
Didn 't you ever have a boyhood ?
Can 't you swim ?
No .
Huh . What 's so funny ?
I was wondering what you would do if you were a cop in venice .
Is that supposed to be a funny crack ?
Well , it has its humorous side .
Man overboard !
It 's all right !
I 've got him !
There you are . Reach for the log .
Stop . Hold on .
It 's lucky for you i knew where that key was .
Yeah , thanks .
Hey , you know , somebody must have left that rail unfastened .
Leaning there , and all of a sudden , we 're in the ocean .
Yes .
We ought to sue the company .
I still can 't see why you saved my life with what 's facing you .
Suppose we don 't discuss that .
Well , anyway , I - i kind of feel like i ought to do you a little favor .
What , for a little thing like your life ?
I 'll tell you what you can do .
What ?
Those are not particularly becoming to the well-dressed man .
Besides , once this ship 's at sea , there 's no chance for a getaway .
Kind of tough on both of us to be ironed .
What do you say ?
All right , then .
Thanks .
But if you try to pull a fast one on me , i 'll knock you off cold , is that understood ?
Obviously .
I ain 't kidding .
I couldn 't suspect you of that .
Well , it 's kind of stuffy in here .
All right if i go on deck ?
Sure .
But i 'll go along with you .
I have an important message to deliver to her , and like an idiot , i forgot her last name .
Her first name is joan .
I 'm sorry - she 's about , oh , she 's about so tall , jet-black hair , and large brown eyes .
Well , without her last name , it 'd be awfully hard for me to find her .
You must come and see us sometime !
No more parties .
No more cigarettes .
No more dancing .
And no more cocktails .
You 're cutting your months into weeks , your weeks into days .
My days into hours .
Is that it ?
It is .
What you really mean , and you 're too kind to say , is that if i stay in my stateroom , lie in bed , deny myself everything , even the - the mildest diversion , i may live to arrive at that charming sanitarium . You state it very cruelly .
It 's not a pretty picture , is it ?
All right .
All right , doctor .
I 'll do what you say .
Hmph . Funny how we cling to life even after it 's worthless .
She 's about so tall , black hair , and large brown eyes .
Her first name is joan .
Oh , no .
No , i was wrong .
I know now what i want .
I want to crowd all the intense , beautiful happiness possible into what life i 've got left .
That 's all living 's for .
If it 's only for a few hours , i want to have it , and i 'm going to have it - all i can get my hands on .
Joan , i - now , doctor , i am going on deck .
But , j - goodbye !
I don 't know .
She might have been in here , but i didn 't notice her .
Hmm . Well , then she wasn 't here . You 'd have noticed her .
Hello , dan .
Hello , joan .
The luck 's come back .
This time , in full glasses .
We mustn 't lose a drop , then .
Health .
Luck .
The day knows how to go out - with a blaze of glory .
Forgive me if i 'm going poetic on you .
But life is wonderful , dan .
And its best moment is when we find it out .
Now we must be going .
- Oh , countess !
- No , no , no , no .
You forgive me . I 'm very fatigued .
Some other time .
Oh , countess , are you of the bavarian barilhauses ?
The elder son .
I had the pleasure of meeting them last summer .
Delightful . We must have tea together sometime .
Countess , you played divinely .
Shall i see you later , countess ?
Not tonight , sir harold .
Tomorrow night , i promise you .
I shall live in anticipation .
Don 't let the royalty get you down .
Well , if it ain 't - play dead , chump .
Tail me to my joint .
Something i can do for you , sir ?
Buttermilk .
Yes , sir .
Say , pal , will you do me a favor ?
Yes , sir ?
What do you call a countess when you want to speak to her ?
Hmm . Madame la comtesse .
Thank you .
Say , don 't you ever breathe ?
What 's the idea of all the landscape gardening ?
Oh , straight gin is so vulgar , my dear ... oh , boy , are my pups growling .
Betty , don 't they ever get on to you ?
You 've been getting away with this for years .
Who are you supposed to be now ?
Sucker , meet bettina .
La comtesse de barilhaus .
Oh , barilhaus .
Oh , i get it - barrel house betty - barilhaus .
Sure . Ha ha .
Have you got anything lined up ?
Did you get a load of that englishman with the single cheater ?
I did . Full face , he looks like the bank of england .
Look , i had an idea - now , lay off .
No petty larceny on this one .
Say , if i make this touch , i 'm through .
I 'm sick of jumping every time there 's a knock at the door .
You know , this sticky stuff 's bad for my scalp .
Hmm . I guess i 'm just tired .
You hustlers are all alike .
Spend all your time in a twilight sleep .
What do you got on your mind ?
Say , i 'm a sucker , just like the rest of them .
I want a chicken ranch .
Oh , sure , i know that one , too .
All you need is 5,000 hens and one rooster .
That 's the setup .
Stop kidding yourself , betty .
You 'll be riding these tubs till they count 10 over you .
I may fool you .
I hope you do .
Spray your throat .
Here 's to the rooster .
Say , who 's the mug with dan hardesty ?
He 's a copper , and the toughest one out of frisco .
Pinch ?
Nothing else .
Tough rap ?
The toughest .
Murder ?
If you can call it murder for croaking the dirtiest heel that ever lived .
Well , any chance to beat the rap ?
No , no .
He 's already been sentenced .
Well , then how 's he - he broke .
He broke when they were taking him to san quentin .
The rope .
He 's a swell guy , too .
Tsk . Gee , came to the front for me in singapore when i was in row .
And i was in row .
He took a long chance for me .
I certainly wish i could pay him back the same way .
Look .
He 's got everything - strength , youth , courage .
Everything that makes life fit to live .
It 's just a ghost .
Is it late ?
Does it matter ?
Not anymore .
The world and time ... seem somewhere else .
Death ain 't tough enough .
He 's got to fall in love .
Let 's take a turn around the deck .
I do 40 laps a day .
Keeps you in shape .
What 's the percentage of me keeping in shape ?
Well , it 's better than mooning around the deck all night .
Oh , good morning .
Hello .
May i present mr .
Burke .
Miss ames .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
Mr. Burke is an old friend of mine .
We 're traveling together .
How nice .
Yeah , we 're together all the time .
Practically inseparable .
Well , i 'm taking him for the afternoon .
Come along , dan .
Well , that 's all right .
Hey , you little tramp !
I ought to throw you overboard !
Oh ! Isn 't it possible for a lady to go anywhere nowadays without bumping into all sorts of people ?
If i had you on shore , i 'd - oh , i 'm so frightened .
Uh , nobody 's gonna harm you .
Oh , you are good .
So brave .
I am very , very grateful .
Aw , don 't mention it ... madame la comtesse .
Oh , you know me , ah ?
Who i am .
I have not the pleasure to know you .
Well , my name 's steve burke .
Delighted .
Monsieur burke .
Now , come .
You sit down with me for a few minutes , hmm ?
Oh , that terrible man , he might come back .
Nobody 's gonna bother you , not with me here .
You know , i could not feel safer if i thought you were a policeman .
Say , now , listen , lady ... hey .
Oh , yes !
I almost forgot - my change .
I beg your pardon , sir .
What was it you gave me ?
I gave you a $ 5 bill .
Yes , sir .
I 'm sorry , sir .
Sorry , sir .
Oh , oh , wait , you only took out for one drink .
I had three .
Oh , thank you , sir .
Thank you .
Think nothing of it , my good man .
I beg your pardon .
After you , sir .
Say , how long is this parade gonna last ?
Oh , you won 't talk , huh ?
No , you don 't . No , you don 't .
It 's my turn now .
Well , you got away with it that time , but i know what you look like , and it won 't happen again .
Dan , dan , wait .
Oh , my dear .
What is it , joan ?
I 'm all right .
Let 's - let 's go out on deck .
Why , yes , of course , dear .
Better ?
Much better out here .
It is rather nice to get away from people , isn 't it ?
Oh , dan , i 'm so happy .
Tomorrow , honolulu .
I have the whole day planned .
First , we 'll hire a car , drive across the pali .
Just we two , hmm ?
Yes .
You don 't sound very enthusiastic .
Only because ... there 's something that may prevent my going ashore .
Oh , dan , and i 'd counted on it so .
Well , don 't worry .
I 'll get out of it somehow .
Sweetheart .
Think you can lose your friend steve ?
I 'll make it my supreme effort .
You know , i can 't dance with everybody , but with you , countess ... you know , steven dances like a gigolo .
Well , i wouldn 't say that exactly .
You two ain 't so bad yourselves .
Why ain 't you going at it ?
I 'm saving my strength for tomorrow in honolulu .
Dan 's taking me for a long drive .
Oh , so you 're going for a long ride , huh ?
That 's swell .
I think i need a lemonade .
Come , steven .
We 'll see you later .
Au revoir .
What 's the matter , steven ?
I wonder if that guy back there thinks he 's bullying me .
Why ?
What about ?
Well , i may as well tell you now .
We ain 't pals . He 's my prisoner .
What ?
You are police officer ?
Sergeant , first-grade .
Oh . And i know what 's going on in that guy 's mind like i can open it and look in it .
Oh , you 're wonderful .
You know , i always wanted to meet a detective .
Honolulu 's the last stop .
That means it 's his last chance to make a getaway .
And that 's what that guy 's thinking - thinking every moment .
He 's only wasting his time .
Across the island , i know the most divine spot .
I 'll take you there and have you all to myself .
Let him once get near the shore , and he 'll risk his life to make a getaway .
But if he makes one phony move ... oh , you frighten me .
What are you going to do ?
I 'm gonna put him in the brig .
Brig ?
What is brig ?
That 's what they call a jail on a ship .
Good night , dan .
Good night , joan .
Until tomorrow .
What 's the matter ?
From the copper 's gun !
How 'd you get ' em ?
Now get this .
You go to dan hardesty .
You 're slated for the brig any minute .
I was afraid of that .
But look .
From burke 's gun ?
Yeah , betty pulled his teeth .
That gives me a chance .
Hey , and here 's a bankroll .
You 'll need it .
Compliments of betty .
English money ?
Well , that 's the only kind sir harold had .
What a girl .
Come on , dan , get going .
Thanks , skippy .
All the luck in the world , pal .
I 'll need it .
He won 't get out of there .
That 's okay .
Can i help you bring him down ?
No , no . I don 't need any help .
I can handle him myself .
I 'd like you to deliver this to miss joan ames in stateroom b-55 ... about an hour after the ship docks in honolulu .
Yes , sir .
You understand , about an hour after we dock .
Not before that .
Very good , sir .
And don 't disturb me for a couple of hours .
I think i 'll take a nap .
I 'll ring if i want you .
Very good , sir .
Well , pal , you look pretty smooth .
Going ashore ?
Yeah , but i 'm sorry , pal .
You 're going in the brig .
That 's a bit tough , but i can 't say i blame you .
Yeah , you know how it is .
A guy 's got to do his duty .
Not bad .
And now , if you 've no serious objections , pal , let 's get going .
No objections .
All right , pal , across the hall and down through the engine room .
Listen , sucker , next time you take the shells out of a smart guy 's gun , remember to put some blanks back .
Dan is in the brig .
The copper 's got the key here . Oh .
Good morning .
I was just waiting for mr .
Burke to take me ashore . Seen dan ?
Uh , no . No , but he 'll be along soon .
Good morning , ladies .
Good morning , mr .
Burke . Oh ! Doesn 't he look handsome ?
Have you seen dan anywhere ?
Why , no , i have - i haven 't .
We 've got to go .
See you ashore .
Au revoir .
Gee , that was a tough spot .
Poor kl - le pauvre enfant .
The cop and betty have gone ashore .
Give them plenty of time for a head start .
Dan !
Oh , dan .
Dan , i 've been looking all over for you .
I 'm so sorry , but i - it 's all right , now that you 're here now .
Well , come on , let 's go , shall we ?
Of course .
Wait till i get this up .
There we are .
Good morning , mr .
Good morning , doctor .
Now , please be careful . Not too strenuous today .
Don 't you worry about me , old dear .
Come along , dan .
Goodbye .
It happened so fast - oh !
Oh ! That terrible drunk again !
When you get to frisco , i 'll pop you in the can so fast , you won 't come out till chinese new year !
Buddy , when i get back to frisco , you 'll be tripping over your beard .
Now , if you don 't mind waiting for just a couple of moments , i have a little surprise for you .
I 'll wait .
So i 've got to get out of here today .
I see .
I 've got the man .
Have you got plenty of money ?
There she is .
You can 't miss it .
What time do we sail ?
Just as soon as it 's dark .
We 'll be ready to shove off the minute you step aboard .
Good .
Gardenias , pikake , and camellia .
It 's too beautiful .
Now , over the pali .
We 're off .
I could stay here forever .
I wonder .
I know it .
Would you be content to spend the rest of your life with me in some ... faraway place ?
Anywhere , dan .
Why so serious ?
Joan , dear , i 've got to tell you this .
Dan , if it 's serious , i don 't want to hear it .
But i must tell you this .
Not today .
But , my dear - shh .
May i have a cigarette ?
You 're incorrigible .
Oh , boy , it 's dark in there .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5, 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 .
$ 4 , please .
11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 !
This is living , isn 't it , dan ?
Could we ask for more ?
Only ...
that it would never end .
It won 't end , will it , dan ?
My dear , whatever happens ... we belong to each other always .
Hold me closer .
What 's this , tears ?
Oh . I can 't help feeling a little bit sad .
It 's been such a happy day .
I guess we ... we ought to go back , shouldn 't we ?
I suppose so .
The dock 's over there , dan .
Yes , it 's still there .
The gangplank 's there .
We can make it if we hurry .
Joan , dear ... dan , we 'll have to hurry .
- I 've got to tell you this .
You must go the rest of the way alone .
What do you mean ?
I 've been trying to tell you all day .
I 'm not going back on the ship .
You 're ... not going back on the ship ?
I can 't go back , dear , because i 'm an es - my dear ?
Joan ?
Dear ?
Might i help you ?
Yes .
Will you turn the car around and keep the engine going ? Yes .
Is she all right , doctor ?
I believe so .
Dan ?
Yes , dear ?
Dan ... don 't leave me .
Poor guy .
What did you say ?
Oh , i didn 't say nothing .
Aloha oe aloha oe ... ah , you 're a swell guy , steve .
Get out of here and never come back !
If you ever come back ... don 't forget to write , now , will you ?
Don 't you ever come back here !
And the next stop , sucker , is san francisco .
I 'm sorry to disturb you .
It 's you , doctor .
Oh , nothing 's happened .
I just want to have a little talk with you .
Well ?
You 're the only one that can help me .
Her condition is desperate .
She must have absolute quiet and rest if she 's to reach the mainland alive .
She survived this attack , but it isn 't humanly possible for her to survive another .
The slightest excitement might kill her .
A shock surely would .
Can i depend upon you ?
Of course .
Thank you .
Now try and get a little more rest .
Oh , doctor ?
I 've got to tell you this .
There is a shock coming , and i don 't know how to avoid it .
When we reach san francisco , i 'll be met by the police .
They 're taking me to san quentin ... for murder .
I 'll play you a game of pegs .
And i think you 'd better rest .
You 're beginning to even look like my doctor .
You shouldn 't come here .
Oh , fine . Sue me .
I came to pay you the money i owe you .
- Sir harold ?
- Uh-huh .
I thought i told you to lay off him .
Well , what was the use of letting him go to waste ?
You weren 't using him .
I 've been busy .
Ah , sure - with that copper .
You know , i think you 're falling for him .
He 's not such a bad guy .
Oh , sure .
Copper lover !
Falling for the law .
The fox falling in love with the hounds .
I 'm ashamed of you .
I tell you , that guy is no good .
Now , wait a minute .
His racket 's on the other side of the fence , but he 's playing it on the up-and-up .
He 's 100 % copper , just the same as you 're 100 % thief .
And you know yourself - 100 % puts you at the head of the class .
I wonder if i 'm hearing all this right .
Scram .
Good night , countess .
Quick , bartender , get me a drink , quick .
Yes , sir .
Quick , before the fight begins .
Yes , sir .
Here you are , sir .
Good , give me another - another one , quick .
Quick , before the fight begins !
Wait a minute , wait a minute .
What fight ?
The fight between you and me .
I can 't pay for these drinks .
The golden gate .
I remember an old hymn .
How did it go ?
Keep those golden gates wide open .
Keep those gates ajar .
Yes , i remember that .
I was born here in san francisco , and when i was a youngster , i used to think they were singing about this golden gate .
I thought it was the only one .
I hope you were wrong .
I hope so .
Lovely , isn 't it ?
Voila .
Your san francisco , hmm ?
Home .
Yeah .
Here , get a load of this .
Well , i 've seen some royalty in me time , but i thought she was the grandest of the lot .
Oh . I hate to deliver it .
You know , i 'm sort of tired of being a copper .
Oh , i don 't know .
L - i just sort of feel that i won 't enjoy being the law anymore , after what 's happened .
And i was wondering if you 'd be willing ... well , i sort of ... i sort of thought that ... well , anyway , i got a ranch half paid for .
A ranch ?
Sure .
I got a chicken ranch in petaluma .
Oh , i 'd love it , steven , but there 's something i have to tell you first .
Ah , you 're a right guy , and i 'm gonna come clean with you .
In the first place , i 'm not a count - beg your pardon , sir .
You were saying ?
I was saying , i 'm not any of the things you think i am .
I 've been a long way , and i 've left a wide trail .
If it 's your past , mine ain 't been no bed of violets .
What do you say we forget about it ?
Let 's start from scratch .
You on the level , steve ?
On the level .
What do you say , countess ?
Don 't smear my bangs .
Remember our first ?
We thought it was our last .
You never can tell .
Four glorious weeks .
So many happy hours . And there 's so many more , too .
Aren 't there , dan ?
Of course , dear .
We mustn 't miss one of them .
We won 't , dear .
Where shall we dine tonight ?
Does it matter ?
Not as long as we 're together , but ...
it 's fun to plan ahead .
Let 's see .
I 'd like to be in caliente for new year 's .
Just a month , isn 't it ?
Well , then , here 's to agua caliente , new year 's eve .
Nothing can keep me away .
Nor me .
I 'll finish packing and join you .
All right , sweet .
Sorry , dan .
You have to use those ?
I 've got to deliver you according to hoyle .
It 's murder .
If we can get off the boat without her seeing us ... i 'll do my best .
Thanks .
Let 's go .
You could have knocked me down with a belaying pin .
And then , as nice as you please , he put the handcuffs on him .
Where 's mr .
Hardesty ?
I was just telling her , miss - right here , in front of me very eyes , his friend , his best pal , as you might rightly call him , takes out a pair of handcuffs , and snap , snap , and he 's a prisoner .
Dan ?
The very same , miss , and a nicer gentleman you wouldn 't wish to meet .
And him - a red-handed murderer .
And he has me bobbing in and out of here with no thought of me own life , turning me back on him .
Why , he might have cut my throat from ear to ear .
Dan .
Joan !
Goodbye , dan .
Not goodbye , dear .
Auf wiedersehen ... until new year 's eve .
Auf wiedersehen .
I 'll be glad when this thing 's over .
You 're telling me .
These holidays are dynamite .
Hey , look out for them glasses with your elbow .
I never touched any glasses .
That 's the most I got , 3,000 bottles .
You got things your own way now , Louis .
Sure .
Everything is just fine .
That 's good .
But Pete was saying just tonight ..
He say the South Side get out of line .
What are we gonna do with the South Side ?
Let some of the other boys get theirs too .
I got all I want .
Johnny Lovo is talking about starting something .
He 's looking for trouble ?
Johnny 's foolish .
Look at me .
A man got to know whether he 's got it or not .
I got plenty .
I got the house .
I got the automobile , the nice girl .
I got a stomach problem too .
- Better get some sleep .
- All right .
Well , it was a pretty good party .
Next week I 'll give a party which the boys have never seen nothing like it before .
Gonna have more music , much more girls , much more everything .
Everybody will say , " Ah , big Louis ! "
" He sit on top of the world . "
- Goodbye , Louis .
- Goodbye , boys .
Take good care of yourself .
I 'll see you some more .
Hello . I want Lakeside 417 , please .
Yeah . 417 Lakeside .
Sure .
That 's a wrong number ?
No , I want Lakeside 417 .
Hello , Louis .
All right .
It 's rotten .
" Costillo 's slaying starts gang war . ' That 's what I want .
I 'm working on that angle .
- I 've got four men on it .
- Four ?
You 'll need 40 men on this story for the next five years .
Do you know what 's happening ?
This town is up for the grabs .
Get me ?
Costillo was the last of the old-fashioned gang leaders .
There 's a new crew coming out and every guy with money for a gun is gonna try to step into his place .
You see ?
They 'll be shooting each other like rabbits .
For control of the booze business .
Get it ?
It 'll be just like war .
That 's it .
War .
You put that in the lead .
Gang war .
Here come the coppers .
Hello , Rinaldo .
You coming along ?
Where 's Camonte ?
- Hello , Guarino .
- Come on .
What 's your hurry ?
I 'm getting a massage too .
We 'll finish that at headquarters .
Put your coat on .
I got lots of time .
- Who wants to see me ?
- The Chief .
- That kidney foot ?
- Never mind the jokes .
Come on .
Hey , how 's it look in the back ?
Very good .

Bodyguard for Costillo ?
Pretty smart boy .
I suppose you didn 't kill Louis Costillo .
Who , me ?
Very funny .
Big Louis and me , we 're like this .
- Can I slap it out of him ?
- I 'll let you have him in a while .
This fella 's got ideas I don 't like .
Costillo hired you for a bodyguard .
Where were you ?
- I was having my beauty sleep .
- Where ?
In a lady 's house .
You want her name ?
Phone number ?
She 's very nice .
We 'll go into your alibis later .
You 've been hanging around Johnny Lovo .
Lovo split with Big Louis .
What were you doing at Lovo 's house last week ?
Now , listen , Tony .
I 'm gonna give you a chance .
Play ball with me and I 'll play ball with you .
Last night , you met Johnny in Spinelli 's barbershop .
What did he give you money for ?
Now , listen , you .
What kind of mug do you think I am ?
I don 't know nothing .
I don 't see nothing .
I don 't hear nothing .
And when I do , I don 't tell a cop .
You understand ?
- All right , Guarino . You can have him .
- Thanks .
Come on , Tony .
We 'll take a look at the goldfish .
Here 's Epstein .

Writ of habeas corpus for the release of Camonte and Rinaldo .
- Who gave it to you ?
- Fleming .
- All right , gentlemen , see you later .
- I don 't go with this guy ?
No .
Listen to me .
You 've come to town .
Think you 're headed somewhere .
You think you 'll get there with a gun but you won 't .
Know why ?
You 've got $ 1,000 bills pasted across your eyes .
Some day you 'll fall in the gutter .
Right where the horses have been standing , where you belong .
You 've got me all figured out .
I spent my life mixing with your breed .
I don 't like it .
You can hide behind a lot of red tape , crooked lawyers , habeas corpus , witnesses that don 't remember , but we 'll get through to you like the rest .
- Maybe me , I 'm different .
- No , you 're not .
We 'll get you in a tough spot and you 'll squeal .
Like all the other rats .
Gonna get me ?
In your particular case , I 'd give up a month 's pay for the job .
- Are you gonna see Lovo ?
- Right away .
Tell him to stay undercover .
I 'll come tomorrow .
- What 's this writ ?
- Habeas corpus . " Deliver the body . "
Can 't hold you without booking you , no matter what .
That 's a fine idea .
You tell Fleming I want lots of them .
- Hi , boss .
- Come in , Tony .
Glad to see you .
Hey , that 's pretty hot .
- Silk .
Expensive , huh ?
- I see that Epstein got to you in time .
- Nice little fella .
- He give them a writ of " hocus-pocus " .
- Sit down .
He said you stay here till the heat 's off .
He said ...
- That 's pretty hot .
- That 's Poppy .
Hey , Poppy .
Meet Tony Camonte .
Hi
- How are the coppers taking it ?
- I didn 't pay much attention .
- What about the newspapers ?
- I bring them along .
The News has got the best story .
Pictures of you .
- And one of me too .
- Where 'd they run it , the razor ads ?
Huh ? Oh , that ?
That 's ah old business .
You 'll get used to that .
- I got it in the war .
- War with a blonde in a speakeasy .
Some kidder .
It takes a long time with the pinchers ?
You got an office for this sort of thing .
There you are .
That 's a bonus .
- That 's a nice fee .
- That was a fine job .
Remember that 's only chicken feed .
You stepped into big company .
You stick to me , do what I say , you 'll be walking around with a gold hat .
- Do you know what I mean ?
- I know .
I 'm gonna cut you in on a percentage .
Give you a raise .
The South Side is rolling in jack .
All we do is take it .
- And have some fun with O 'Hara .
- Who ?
Now , wait a minute .
- O 'Hara 's too big a guy .
- Lots of jack on the North Side .
Now , listen , you .
Let me think up the ideas .
I 'll take care of him when the time comes .
I say we stay out of the North Side , leave O 'Hara alone .
What I say goes .
Don 't ever forget that .
- You 're the boss .
- That 's better .
From now , next to me , the boys take orders from you .
Me and you , that 's fine talk , boss .
Here , have a cigar .
There 'll be work for everybody .
Costillo slowed down too much .
Yeah , and now he 's come to a dead stop .
Here , you 'd better smoke one of mine .
That 's pretty nice .
Expensive , huh ?
I don 't like cigar smoke in my room .
Do you mind ?
I 'm gonna hold off that meeting with the boys .
After Big Louis ' funeral is better .
You know what I mean ?
Yeah .
Sure .
It don 't look so good .
I want you to send some flowers , a cross of white carnations from me .
Yeah , and I 'll send a purple bunch .
Big Louis always liked purple .
Why don 't you go and do it now ?
You better make that meeting Monday .
Tell all the guys to be there .
Tell them I 'm gonna make a speech .
Know what I mean ?
Goodbye , Poppy .
See you again .
She don 't like anybody but me .
She 's a very busy girl .
Expensive , huh ?
Here , Little Boy .
Easy dough for standing outside and listening to a gun go off ?
- When will we get more ?
- We get plenty .
This business is waiting for some guy to run it right .
- I got ideas .
- We 're working for Lovo , ain 't we ?
Lovo ?
Who 's Lovo ?
Just some guy who 's a bit more smart than Louis .
That guy is soft .
I could just see it in his face .
He 's got a set-up , that 's all , and we gotta wait .
Some day , I 'm gonna run the whole works .
Remember those monkeys on the North Side ain 't so soft .
Say , they 're satisfied , ain 't they ?
Why didn 't they take Big Louis before we did ?
Listen , Little Boy , there 's only one law you gotta follow to keep out of trouble .
Do it first . Do it yourself .
And keep on doing it .
- Where 's Cesca ?
I don 't know .
She go out .
What do you mean ?
Ain 't she coming home for dinner ?
I don 't like that .
Tell her to come home to dinner .
Sure , I tell her lots of times .
Come home .
Tony no like .
She don 't .. -
- That 's a nice way to catch you .
- What do you mean ?
- You was kissing him .
- What of it ?
I don 't like it .
I don 't want anybody kissing my sister .
- Don 't want anybody 's hands on you .
- What are you doing ?
- I 'm your brother .
- You don 't act it .
- You act like ...
Sometimes I think ..
- I don 't care what you think .
- Do what I say .
- I never have fun .
" Never have fun . " You call that fun ?
Running around with guys like that is fun ?
Listen , you want the real fun ?
Here .
How 's that ?
- Gee , where 'd you get it ?
- Never mind .
You just spend it .
- You 're swell .
- Go on , get ready for dinner .
Remember , you do what I say .
No more fellas , understand ?
What for you wanna give her money ?
She 's just a kid .
She wants to have fun .
Sometimes I think you crazy .
Cesca !
- What for you take that money ?
- I want it , that 's why .
Give it back .
It 's bad money .
Tony no get it in no good way .
- It 's gonna bring you trouble .
- What do I care ?
Nothing wrong in giving it to me .
- Tony wants me to have a good time .
- Yes ?
You listen !
Tony no love you like he make you believe .
All the time he smile on top but what he thinks ...
He got a lot of tricks .
He don 't give money to nobody for nothing .
- He would to his sister .
- Sister !
That make no difference .
To him , you just another girl .
Some day , when he need you , he mix you up in his business , like anyone .
And he 's gonna make you bad like him .
He can 't make me do anything I don 't want to .
I can take care of myself .
- Yeah ?
All of the time Tony say like that .
Afterwards , he no belong to me no more .
He 's no good and now you start to be just like him .
No , I 'm not .
Don 't worry about me .
I 'll get along all right .
Thank you .
That 's all right , boys .
Just changing the name on the door .
Meet the new president , Johnny Lovo .
Hiya , boys .
Where 's Berdini , Zeigler , Meehan ?
- Anybody see them ? I did .
They ain 't coming .
- That all they said ?
- They said , take a flying ..
OK .
Now we know where they stand .
All right , guys , I 'm making a speech .
Here it is .
Big Louis gets a wad of dough then he gets soft .
He lets you come and run beer .
I 'm gonna change it .
You can stay in but you operate the way I say .
- Are you asking us or telling us ?
- I 'm telling you .
We 're gonna get organised .
It 'll mean twice as much dough for everybody .
- And half as much trouble .
- You got something figured out ?
Not being able to get it will make this town thirstier than ever .
Running beer is a business .
I 'll run it like one .
Swell .
We been cutting each other 's throats long enough .
3,000 saloons on the South Side .
Haifa million customers .
Add up what they pay a year for drinks . Nobody in charge .
So you 're going to be it .
Yeah , " it " .
That 's me .
I make my own beer and I got my own trucks .
I don 't have to go into business with nobody .
- Where are you going ?
- Who wants to know ?
You sit down here and don 't interrupt the President no more .
All right , President .
Well , are the rest of you guys in or out ? I 'm in .
- What about Meehan ?
- Yeah , Berdini and Zeigler .
They 're selling to 7-800 joints between them .
Yeah ?
Well , from now on they 're out .
- Those joints buy from us .
- Sure .
Try that .
Meehan will turn this side of town into a shooting gallery .
Fine .
Anything he starts , we 'll finish .
You don 't have to worry .
- All you gotta do is to haul beer .
- Yeah ?
Who 's gonna stick his neck in those joints ?
My friend Tony Camonte .
Yeah , I 'm what you call a good salesman .
I start right now to get orders , boss ?
All you can get .
Go to it .
Dope , you got a pencil ?
Boss , I don 't write .
- That 's one .
- Come on .
Come on , Little Boy .
Business .
What is this ?
Let go of me , will you ?
What do you want ?
Let go !
- What 's the idea ?
Come on .
Say , what 's the big idea ?
- Who are you buying from ?
- Man in Virginia .
- How many barrels a day ?
- Three .
He 's lying , Tony .
He 's been taking five .
Chiseller !
You 're getting eight now and you 're buying from Johnny Lovo .
But listen ...
I can 't use eight barrels .
I 'll get you some soap .
Take a bath .
- What do you pay a barrel ?
- 50 .
65 is better .
You get delivery tomorrow .
- What about Meehan and Berdini ?
- We 'll take care of them .
Don 't worry .
Well , that 's order number one .
Now we get plenty more .
There 's a system to these things .
How many barrels did you say you wanted ?
- Six .
- Well , you 're getting ten .
You 're getting a delivery tomorrow .
There 's no use arguing with this joint .
Zeigler runs it himself .
Step on it .
Hi , boss .
Lots of garlic .
Get me some too .
- How 's business ?
More orders ? - Lots .
They all buy from us .
- All we have to do is fill them .
- Better tell Meehan and Berdini .
- Them fellas retired from business .
- What have you been doing ?
You said if they start something , we 'll finish it ?
- Well , did you ?
- About an hour ago .
- Hey , kid !
- Extra !
Keep the change .
Here you are , boss .
There 's your South Side hailed in a box .
Nailed in a ...
You didn 't get the lid on very tight .
- What do you mean ?
- Look at that .
Come on .
Hey , keep ours hot .
We 'll be back .
You can 't come in .
This is a private hospital .
You can 't come in ..
What did they do ?
- Hi , Poppy .
- Hello .
What 's all the time biting you ?
You afraid of me ?
That outfit is enough to give anybody the yips .
Nice , huh ?
I got three more .
- Different colours .
I see you 're going in for jewellery .
- Kind of effeminate , isn 't it ?
- Yeah .
I got them in an auction .
A bargain .
You sure are a funny mixture .
- That 's the first time you 've smiled .
- Yeah ?
How do you mean I 'm funny ?
You just are .
What else are you doing with all your money ?
I hear you 're getting a new car .
It 's different .
It 's got bullet-proof glass and a steel body .
I got myself a new house too .
Come up sometime ?
Yeah , I 'll bring my grandmother .
No kidding , you 'll come up ?
Why don 't you get yourself a girl , Tony ?
- I 'm working on that now .
- Yeah ?
Well , don 't tire yourself out .
- Johnny in ?
- Yeah .
He 's mad , huh ?
Hi , boss .
When are you gonna learn that I am the boss ?
What do you mean by breaking up that Lakeview joint last night ?
- Listen , it was easy .
- It was O 'Hara 's place .
And you know it .
I told you I wasn 't ready for O 'Hara .
- 50 barrels a week !
- I don 't care if it 's 50 a day .
Do you think with a beer keg ?
We get this territory smooth and you step out .
How do you mean ?
I just sell a little more beer .
- Don 't worry .
- Do you know what O 'Hara will do ?
He 'll send his guns down to the South Side .
We 're liable to get it .
That hop is tough .
He ain 't so tough .
Hanging out in a flower shop .
You afraid of a guy like that ?
I ain 't afraid of anybody .
- Sure you 're not .
That 's a crazy question , eh , Johnny ?
Come on , don 't argue .
- Where are you going ?
- To clean up after you , you mug .
Look out !
It 's Keach .
Hello ?
This is Mr. Camonte 's secketary .
What 's the name , please ?
It 's Mr. Camonte 's secketary .
- Secketary , I told you . - Hey , hey , hey .
" Secretary " , you dope !
OK , boss .
No , I was no talking to you .
I was talking to Mr. Camonte , my boss .
Hey . Get a name .
What 's your name ?
No , no , I no wanna know what 's your brother 's name .
Your name .
You do ?
Listen , I come on over there and smack you in the teeth .
- I get you , your brother ...
- That 's no way to talk .
Talk nice .
Tell him to state his business .
Go state your business !
Who was it ?
- I don 't know .
- What do you mean , " I don 't know " ?
Didn 't I tell you to always get a name and write it down here ?
- I forget again .
- Hey , what are you writing there ?
- I don 't know .
I can 't write .
Can 't write ?
A secretary who can 't write !
A secretary must be able to write .
Must be educated .
Get education .
Can 't write !
Education ?
That 's your fault .
This is Mr. Camonte 's ..
Oh , no , please , you are wrong .
I not hang up on you .
I thought you was through .
I told you before , you have to write a letter .
You have to make ...
Oh , you too , huh ?
Let me tell you ..
Shut up , you .
What 's the matter with you ?
Listen , the last time I tell you ..
You pick yourself a nice one .
- You get one for me ?
- Didn 't have time .
- Was there any trouble ?
- No , it was easy .
- How many was there ?
- He was alone .
Hello .
Who is it ?
I 'm so ... I don 't get ..
Boss , I don 't get the name .
Yeah ?
Who ?
Oh , sure .
Sure , send her right up .
That 's Poppy .
Better nobody see you with this .
Hello , handsome .
- Well ...
Poppy .
- Hello , Tony .
They tell me O 'Hara was killed in his flower shop this morning .
- Had you heard that ?
- Did Johnny send you up here ?
Johnny ?
How do you like this place ?
- Kind of gaudy , isn 't it ?
- Ain 't it ?
Glad you like it .
Come here .
I 'll show you something nice .
Steel shutters .
On all the windows .
It 's my own idea .
In case you have visitors you don 't like ?
That 's right .
How do you like the view here ?
You see that ?
Some day I look at that sign and say ,
" OK , she 's mine . '
You think so ?
I got a pretty good idea .
That 's pretty hot .
Expensive , eh ?
Come here , I 'll show you something what 's pretty hot .
How do you like this place ?
Come here .
Here 's some stuff I bought .
- Aren 't they sweet ?
- You like ?
I 'm gonna get some ties to match .
I 'm gonna wear a shirt only once . Then I give it away to the laundry .
A new shirt every day .
You 're gonna drive the women mad , aren 't you ?
- Yeah .
One of them .
- Meaning me , I suppose .
Look at this .
It 's got inside springs .
I bought it in an auction .
It 's a bargain .
Go on , sit down , try it .
- Yeah , it 's all right .
- You like it ?
I thought you were Johnny 's friend .
Sure , I like Johnny .
But I like you more .
Scusi , boss .
- Cops is downstairs .
- Tell them to come in and sit down .
I be right out .
OK .
- I don 't want to be caught here .
- It 's all right .
Don 't get excited .
It 's easy .
- Oh , great , thanks .
- Poppy .
After I get through , I 'll meet you at the restaurant at 4th Street .
- Go to the left . - Uh-huh .
- Hello , Guarino .
- Hello .
- You all alone ?
- Yeah .
You 're a cute fella coming here all by yourself .
- You ain 't afraid of me ?
- Nor ten like you .
The Chiefs waiting .
Hey , Angelo .
Call up Epstein and tell him ..
Call Epstein .
Tell him a kidney foot 's taking me down to the Chiefs office .
Tell him to come right down with habeas corpus .
Hey , you know , I just heard that O 'Hara met with a terrible accident .
- That 's too bad .
- Yeah ?
Come on .
Camonte thinks he 's gonna run this side of town now he 's got O 'Hara .
- He 's getting too big .
- Yeah ?
He won 't get any bigger .
We 'll take him before he finds out about these guns .
300 slugs a minute .
Get the rest of them unpacked .
- How many we got ?
- Plenty .
There 's a lot more coming .
O 'Hara had them run in last night .
- Got the cops on our necks .
- Forget it .
They can 't do anything about it .
There 's no law against bringing guns into the state .
We can buy all we want .
- What a cinch .
- You said it .
Camonte just left headquarters .
McGill 's trailing him .
He 's gonna phone .
Hey , you guys .
Load those guns .
You get the cars ready .
Stick the hearse in front of them .
Then to the South Side .
I want everybody .
Hang on to that phone .
Snap into it , now .
Get going .
Hello , Tony .
Have a seat .
- Well , what took you so long ?
- He was late with the habeas corpus .
Go on , order some food . I 'm hungry .
Every time I see you , you look better .
That 's a cute hat .
Please , my stockings !
- What 's the matter ?
- Don 't do that .
They 're brand-new .
- Hands off ?
- No , feet .
You know , I know lots of girls .
Redheads and blondes , all kinds .
- They all like me .
- Yeah , you 're pretty good , eh ?
- I 'm the best .
- Are you gonna eat , by any chance ?
I 'm not hungry .
Except for you .
- You got something I like .
- I 'm nice with a lot of dressing .
- You work fast , don 't you , Tony ?
- I been waiting a long time .
I 'm crazy for you .
Everybody says , " Tony Camonte , he 's a big shot . "
" He 's got everything he wants . "
I got everything but what I want .
You understand ?
Pardon me .
Telephone for Mr. Camonte .
Hey , dope .
Go see who it is .
And get a name .
Hello .
This Mr. Camonte 's secretary .
What 's your name ?
I say , what 's your name ?
This Mr. Camonte 's secretary .
Speak louder .
I can 't hear what you 're saying .
That 's too loud .
Talk lower .
Hello ?
Please ?
Don 't be a fool .
What 's the name , please ?
Again .
Hello , please ?
I can 't hear what you say .
That 's O 'Hara 's mob .
I can 't hear .
I can 't hear what ..
Hey , look .
They got machine guns you can carry .
- If I had them , I could run the works .
- I 'll get you one .
Hey , that 's swell .
You can carry it .
Let 's get out of here .
Boss , too much noise .
I didn 't get the name .
That 's a dope .
Take him upstairs .
Hey , look .
They 've been here too .
Hey , come here .
Come here .
Let 's see if this works .
Hey , you .
Call Foghetti .
Tell him we want three cars .
Hey , Johnny .
Look what I got .
Dirty , murdering mug .
You bumped off O 'Hara .
Who , me ?
That 's foolish .
You told me to stay out of the North Side .
I been home all day .
Eh , Little Boy ?
Sure .
- I told you to lay off .
- I don 't hear so good .
You won 't be hearing anything .
Look what happened to me .
- You can carry it like a baby .
- Shut up , we gotta get organised .
- They 'll be back after us .
- What ?
We go after them .
- We 'll show them Micks .
- Yeah ?
When you 're laying in an alley with your head blown off , you 'll learn .
- Who 's gonna do that ?
- O 'Hara 's mob .
Gaffney .
He 's running it now .
He 'll put lead in your belly .
- Make sure it 's him .
- Cars are here .
Little Boy , fix who goes in each car .
- Where are you going ?
- The North Side .
- You can 't do that .
- Who 's stopping me ?
- I am .
I 'm giving you orders .
- Only one thing gives orders .
This .
How I got the South Side and how I 'll get the North Side .
Some little typewriter .
I 'll write my name all over this town with it .
- Stop him , somebody .
- Out of my way , I 'm gonna spit .
Come on , fellas .
Tony , take this along in case that bean-shooter doesn 't work .
OK .
- See what happened here ?
- I don 't know , mister .
They said a big black car gave them the works .
Hello , Ben .
- What will we do about them guns ?
- What can we do ?
There 's no law against manufacturing them , just having them .
If they can 't get them in one state , they get them in another .
They better do something or what happened before will be a tea party .
I know it .
Put the screws on the 22nd Street freighthouse .
I hear they 're bringing them in in fruit boxes .
- Get that guy 's number .
- Somebody get an ambulance .
- What is this , a pinch ?
- No , just bringing you a Valentine .
- Don 't you know it 's Valentine 's Day ?
- Oh , yeah . I forgot .
Come on , line up , you guys . Over there .
All seven of you .
- What 's the gag ?
Is the heat oh ?
- Plenty .
Face the wall .
Put your mitts up .
All of you .
- Here 's Gaffney .
- What do you know about this ?
Well ?
I was on my way here to keep an appointment .
I was late .
A car drives up and some guys pile out .
Two of them was cops .
At least , dressed like cops .
Cops .
That 's a new gag .
Then what ?
Well , it looked like a pinch , so I beat it till it was over .
Lucky you were late .
Take a good peek and see what you missed .
Seven of them lined up against a wall .
Mowed down , just like that .
- Didn 't have a chance .
- Sit down .
You 'll wear out the carpet .
Yeah ?
I 'm the only one left .
Thinks he 'll get me , huh ?
Fat chance .
Who 's there ?
- McArthur , from the Journal .
Let him in .
- Hi , Gaffney .
- How 'd you find me ?
We boys from the Journal always get around .
- Yeah , anybody else know I 'm here ?
- No , just my own little idea .
Sit down .
You 're gonna stay for a while .
- Well ?
- Can 't get a thing on him .
A blind alley wherever we go .
Gaffney turned yellow and is hiding out .
- What about Lovo ?
- He 's as scared as Gaffney .
It 's Camonte but we can 't prove it yet .
- We will .
- Say , Chief .
This fella Camonte .
A story .
The public 's interested in him .
- He 's a colourful character .
- Colourful ?
What colour is a crawling louse ?
That 's the attitude of too many morons in this country .
They think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods .
What do they do about a guy like Camonte ?
Sentimentalise .
Romance .
Make jokes about him .
They had some excuse for glorifying our old Western bad men .
They met in the street , high noon , and waited to draw .
These things shoot a guy in the back and run away .
Colourful ?
Did you read what happened the other day ?
Car chasing another down the street , broad daylight .
Three kiddies on the sidewalk get lead poured in their bellies .
When I think what goes on in the minds of these lice , I wanna vomit .
Ben , see if you can find Gaffney .
He 'll probably get it next .
They got all the others .
Our organisations are opposed to your policy , Mr. Garston .
Your paper could be an influence against gangsters .
Yet you keep on playing it up as front-page news .
Murders , gang war , killings .
That 's all we read about .
You 're glorifying the gangster by giving him this publicity .
You 're trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him , by keeping him off the front page .
That 's ridiculous .
You 're playing right into his hands .
Run him out of the country .
That 'll keep him off the front page .
In the meantime , you expect our children to read of outrage and murder .
That 's better than their being slaughtered .
The city is full of machine guns .
Gang war on the streets .
Kids aren 't even safe to go to school .
- You want that to go on ?
- Certainly not .
But what can private citizens do ?
Even our police force can 't stop it .
Don 't blame the police .
They can 't stop machine guns from being run across the state lines .
They can 't enforce laws that don 't exist .
- It 's up to the federal government .
- You 're the government .
All of you .
Instead of trying to hide the facts , pass laws that will do good .
For instance ?
A law that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery .
Put teeth in the Deportation Act .
These gangsters don 't belong here .
Half of them aren 't even citizens .
That 's true .
They bring nothing but disgrace to my people .
All right , I 'll tell you what to do .
Make laws and see they 're obeyed , if we have to have martial law to do it .
The Governor of New Mexico declared it to stop a bullfight .
The Governor of Oklahoma to regulate oil production .
Surely gang rule and law defiance are more of a menace to the nation than the regulation of oil or a bullfight .
The army will help .
So will the American Legion .
They offered their services over two years ago , and nobody ever called on them .
Let 's get wise to ourselves .
We 're fighting organised murder .
That Sadie Thompson , she 's a pretty smart girl .
Why does a girl hustle in a place like that ?
Yeah , it 's raining all the time .
That rain , that 's pretty good .
That comes from a pipe just like a shower .
Them two fellas .
Which one do you think she 'd take ?
The guy with the collar ?
- He ain 't so hot .
- Them marines ain 't so hot too .
Come on , I go take a smoke .
That 's a fine show .
I gotta see more shows like that .
You know , serious .
It ain 't got no jokes .
I like a show with jokes .
That 's a dope .
What more do you want ?
Listen .
This girl Sadie , she 's got what you call a problem .
This fella with the collar .
- What 's the matter ?
- Gaffney .
Spotted down Frank 's Bowling Alley .
- It 's a set-up .
It 'd take an hour .
- I 'm at a show .
The last act .
There 's two fellas after a girl .
Her name 's Sadie .
This girl Sadie , she 's what you call .. disillusioned .
We gotta do it now or he might slip us again .
- He 's the last one , boss .
- Come on , Tony .
That 's too bad .
Come on .
Wait a minute .
You stay here .
Stay and see the show .
- Aw , boss .
I gotta know which fella Sadie takes .
You stay here , find out and then come tell me .
It 's all right , boss .
That copper 's gone .
Hey , Little Boy , you go round the back , up on the balcony .
- Hey , Pietro .
- Side door .
He may have friends .
Joe , the alley .
If they get that far , do your stuff .
Keep the motor running .
Bring the present .
You stay here .
Now we 'll know what happened .
Did she take the guy with the collar ?
No , she climbed back in the hay with the army .
- That 's fine .
She 's a smart girl .
- Hey , what are you doing ?
Not bad , huh ?
Just watch this one .
- Hello , Tony .
- How are you ?
- Hello , Camonte .
- Hello , Mike .
That 's pretty hot .
- Hello , stranger .
- Chair .
Well , Johnny .
You 're looking swell .
- I thought we 'd see something of you .
- Well , here I am .
Where have you been ?
On a vacation ?
No , I 've been working .
Up on the North Side .
Eh , Johnny ?
That 's what the papers say .
- Don 't work too hard .
- I just finished up tonight .
Now I play awhile .
- You got your own table , Camonte .
- What 's that ?
- This is a table for two .
- Maybe you 'll get another table .
Listen , you .
Who do you think ... ?
All right , go on .
Nothing seems to bother you much , does it ?
Ah , I get used to noises .
- Hello , Guino .
- Hello , baby .
- Why do you always high-hat me ?
- Go oh , beat it .
I suppose you need an organ-grinder to work with .
Tony 's inside .
He see you in that outfit ?
I look pretty good from two storeys up .
Am I different now ?
- Wanna dance with me ?
- Listen , you 're Tony 's sister , see .
And besides , you 're only a kid .
I 'm 18 .
Like that music ?
- Now do you want to dance ?
- No .
Afraid ?
Afraid of Tony 's sister ?
Why , you ..
I notice you stood there and watched .
Some day you 'll find out you 've been missing something .
Hey , how about it ?
You and me , huh ?
- I thought you weren 't dancing .
- I changed my mind .
I need exercise .
We 'll show them something , huh ?
I think you missed me , huh ?
- That 's right .
We 'll make up for lost time .
How do you wanna play , sweetie ?
Like this ?
That 's good .
You wait here .
I 'll take her home myself .
- You can 't .
- Shut up !
You 'll be sorry for this .
Next time I catch you there , I 'll kill you .
You 're telling me what to do ?
I 'll do what I want .
Understand ?
- You listen to me ...
- I hate you .
Never mind what I do . That 's all right .
But you 're gonna stay home .
Understand ?
I 'm no baby .
I can take care of myself .
Running around with fellas .
Letting them hold you , look at you .
Dressing up like that for fellas to see .
What I do with fellas is my business .
Cesca ?
Cesca , what 's the matter ?
What did Tony do to you ?
He hit me .
He said he 'd kill me and I wasn 't doing anything .
- I was only dancing .
- That 's all right .
All right .
Come upstairs .
No cry , baby .
He has no right to throw me around just because I 'm his sister .
No , no .
All right , don 't cry , baby .
I tell you .
I tell you lots of times .
He hurt you . He hurt you .
He hurt everybody .
Put out his tyres .
That got her .
Give us a nickel .
Lakeside 1305 .
Get me a drink .
- Hello .
- Hello .
Is this Jim ?
Tony Camonte .
- Is Rinaldo there ?
- No , he left an hour ago .
- Is Lovo there ?
- Lovo ?
He left , too .
Said he was going to the office .
Bosworth 4503 .
- Hello .
- Mabel ?
Camonte .
- Rinaldo there ?
- Why , no , he ain 't been here .
That guy is giving me the runaround .
I 've had a date with him ...
- Maybe he 's going home to bed .
- That tomcat ?
Try Maizie .
Maizie , that 's right . I forgot about her .
Uh ... Hatfield 6401 .
Come on .
- Hello .
- Hello .
Maizie ?
It 's Tony Camonte .
- Rinaldo there ?
- Yeah . For you .
- Hello .
- Hello , Rinaldo .
I 'm at Pietro 's . Pietro 's .
- Come right away .
- Anything wrong ?
Yeah , plenty .
Go get me a towel .
I thought you weren 't doing anything tonight .
I 'll be back later .
This is worse than being in love with a grasshopper .
- It took you a long time .
- Who done it ?
I don 't know , but I got an idea .
You just wait .
How do you stand with Lovo ?
- Come on .
- How do you stand with Lovo ?
- Who 's Lovo ?
- That 's good .
Say when .
That 's enough .
You call Johnny Lovo at his office at ten past two , see .
Ten past two .
You say that you 're calling from the country , see .
You 're one of the guys that took me for a ride .
Car got smashed and I got away .
- The car got smashed and I got away . - Yes , yes .
- You think it was Johnny ?
- Don 't know , but we 'll find out .
We 'll be there when Pietro calls .
If it was Johnny , he 'll stall , won 't he ?
- Sure .
- Let 's go .
Open the door .
Let 's go .
Where you been ?
What happened to you ?
- They spoiled my brand-new suit .
- Who , coppers ?
No .
Monkeys .
Never seen them before .
Somebody must 've brought them in .
- How 'd they get you ?
- Smashed my bus .
Took me for a ride .
Almost .
You left the café alone .
You ought to know better .
Where were you ?
I thought you always stuck to Tony .
Well , I 'm glad you got away .
I 'd have missed you plenty .
- I 'll get somebody for this .
- I knew you would .
Poppy .
I don 't want to see her tonight .
- I 'll tell her you ain 't in .
- Wait a minute .
I 'll talk to her .
Hello .
Who ?
No , there 's nobody here by that name .
What ?
Ring off , you 've got a wrong number .
Gonna have a drink ?
You ?
I didn 't do it .
I wouldn 't try anything on you .
We 're pals .
- Sure we 're pals .
- No , I didn 't do it .
You got me wrong .
I brought you out here .
You 're the last guy I 'd try to cross . Don 't take me .
Give me a chance .
You can have anything I got .
All my dough .
Poppy .
I 'll let you have her .
I give you my word .
You can have Poppy .
The boss .
Let me go away .
I never did anything to anybody .
- I haven 't hurt anybody .
- No , you get somebody else to do it .
No .
Wait .
Don 't . Tony , come back . Tony ..
Tony .
What 's happened ?
Where 's Johnny ?
Where do you think ?
Go pack your stuff .
Come here .
Look at that .
You remember what I told you ?
- Tony isn 't here .
He 's out of town .
- You 're telling me ?
Why did you hang up when I called yesterday ?
Too busy .
- The one on the end 's kinda cute .
- She ain 't bad .
I should think you 'd want something more like ...
Like what ?
- Me .
- Cut out that sort of talk .
You 're only a kid .
I told you I had grown-up ideas .
You 're like Tony when you go after something , eh ?
- What would Tony say ?
- He 'll be away for a month .
The big fella is on his way from Florida .
Well , he 'd better watch his step .
This town 's different than when he left .
That new crowd at City Hall is looking for him .
They 'll climb all over him .
Tell him to play it for what it 's worth .
You stay out here .
- Where 's Cesca ?
- She got a place of her own .
She say , " Mind your business , " just like you say .
- Is she living alone ?
- All the time that 's what she tell me .
But I follow her .
She meet a man , they go in the house together .
I look .
I see her name on the push-bell .
See what you do ?
Once I have a son , I have a daughter , and now ...
- Where 's the place she live ?
- 236 Central Street .
What you gonna do ?
What go on ?
Central Street .
- Hello .
- Hello , baby .
- I 'm so happy .
- You 're telling me ?
- You do love me , don 't you ?
- You know I do .
Never stop telling me , will you ?
I 'm not like all the others , am I ?
You 're up there all by yourself , sweetheart .
We 'll always be happy , won 't we ?
Hello , Tony .
Tony ,
Tony , don 't ..
Guino ! Guino !
Guino , speak to me .
Say something .
Tony , he 's my Guino .
I love him .
We married yesterday .
Really married .
We were going to surprise you .
Weren 't we , Guino ?
Oh , darling , please .
He 's dead .
He loved me .
Really loved me .
Don 't touch me .
Don 't come near me .
Stay away from me .
You 're not my brother .
Don 't you think I know ?
Murderer .
He kills people .
He kills everybody .
He kills everything .
He 's a butcher .
That 's what you are .
You 're a butcher .
Right down to the house .
Come on , boss .
Get out of here . Come on .
Mr. Camonte 's sec ..
You have to speak louder .
I can 't hear you .
It 's ... It 's Poppy , boss .
I got her name .
I didn 't know .
Tony , what is it ?
Tony , say something .
Yeah ? Yeah ?
He did ?
Did he get the rest of them ?
Let me talk to Duffy .
Ben , here 's what you 've been waiting for .
Camonte killed Rinaldo .
Holed up in that steel fort of his .
Get him .
Take the whole outfit .
I 'll send more if you heed them .
Don 't lose any men .
Block off the street and smoke him out .
Hello ?
Send those monkeys in .
Tell Jake to stay put .
Tony !
- Quick , Tony .
They 're coming .
The police .
They 're after you .
They 're gonna get you .
Why didn 't you shoot me ? Why didn 't you shoot ?
I don 't know .
Maybe because you 're me .
And I 'm you .
It 's always been that way .
You fellas go on that roof across the street .
Cover that alley at the back of the house .
Tony , what are we gonna do ?
Come here , I show you what we do .
They followed me .
It 's my fault . I shouldn 't have come .
What 's the difference , yours , mine ?
You 're here , that 's all what matters .
- You load them .
- Sure .
- I 'm not afraid .
I 'm like you .
- That 's the way to talk .
Come on , we 'll show them .
Put it here .
We 'll show them .
Look at them monkeys .
They think they 'll get Tony Camonte ?
What did I tell you ?
Look , Cesca , see ?
Steel !
All steel !
All steel .
No one can get in here .
Cesca , you and me , we 'll show them .
We 'll lick them all .
The North Side , the South Side .
We 'll lick the whole world !
Cesca !
Let me lie down , Tony .
I 'm all hollow inside .
- Cesca , what is it ?
Where ? - It doesn 't hurt , really .
Put your arms around me . Just for a minute .
- I won 't be able to help you now .
- You can 't go away .
I won 't let you .
So dizzy .
Hold me .
- Don 't let me get scared .
- I 'll be here all alone .
- You can 't leave me here all alone . - Tony ...
- You 're afraid .
Don 't be afraid .
- You 're all I got left .
Little Boy , he 's gone .
Angelo , he 's gone .
I 'm no good without you .
I 'm no good with myself .
Cesca , they 're out there .
They wanna get me .
They won 't give me a chance .
Please . Cesca !
Guino wasn 't afraid .
Cesca , don 't go .
Please .
I won 't let you go .
You hear ?
You understand ?
You gotta stay here .
I don 't want to stay .
You 're afraid .
Guino . Guino ..
Cesca , please !
Come back , you hear ?
Come back , I say .
Hurry up with that gas .
- That second window up there .
- All right .
Cesca ! Cesca !
I can 't see .
Cesca !
Angelo !
Little Boy !
Cesca .. I can 't see .
Take it down .
Don 't shoot , Guarino .
Look , I 'm all alone .
I got no gun , see .
- Give me a break .
- Who did you ever give a break to ?
Look , I got nobody .
I 'm all alone .
Little Boy is gone .
Angelo is gone .
- My steel shutters don 't work .
- Shut up .
Come down .
I 'll come down .
Give me a break . Don 't shoot .
You got me covered .
I can 't do nothing .
Give me a break , will you ?
Don 't shoot , will you ?
I told you I 'd get you without a gun and you 'd squeal like a yellow rat .
Come on . Climb into this .
# Just the one that you adore # # There needn 't be #
Yes , Baron .
What shall we start with , Baron ?
Hmm ?
Oh , yes .
That 's not so easy .
Beginnings are always difficult .
Yes , Baron .
If Casanova suddenly turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet , who might become Cleopatra , how would you start ?
I would start with cocktails .
Mm-hmm .
Very good .
Excellent .
It must be the most marvelous supper .
We may not eat it , but it must be marvelous .
Yes , Baron .
- And , waiter ?
- Yes , Baron ?
- You see that moon ?
- Yes , Baron .
I want to see that moon in the champagne .
Yes , Baron .
" Moon in champagne " .
I want to see , um ...
Yes , Baron .
- And as for you , waiter ...
- Yes , Baron ?
I don 't want to see you at all .
No , Baron .
- Oh , I beg your pardon .
- Hmm ?
Thank you .
- Oh , my gracious !
He almost saw me .
- Who ?
The Marquis de la Tour .
He was standing in the lobby .
I don 't think he saw me .
I 'm positive he didn 't .
Thank heaven .
But when I came up here , right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia .
- The tennis player ?
- The tennis player .
He saw me . He bowed .
What could I do ?
I nodded .
Baron , I shouldn 't have come .
But you came .
And you must forget everything ... except that you are here , Countess .
Out there in the moonlight everything seemed so perfect , so simple .
But now ...
- Do you know King Boris ?
- No , no .
- Do you the know the Marquis de la Tour ?
- I should like to .
You 'd better not .
He 's really very dull .
But anyhow , when the king tells the marquis that he saw me , the marquis will tell the marquise , and the marquise is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro .
And she will telephone the Princess de Costa .
The princess doesn 't like me .
- But I don 't care .
- Why should you ?
But she talks a lot .
And before this night 's over , all Venice will know about it .
By tomorrow it 'll be Grand Canal gossip .
Oh .
Don 't stop .
Keep right on complaining .
It 's beautiful .
You know , when I first saw you , I thought you were an American .
Thank you .
Someone from another world ...
so entirely different .
Oh .
One gets so tired of one 's own class .
Princes and counts and dukes and kings .
Everybody talking shop , always trying to sell jewelry .
Then I heard your name and found out you were just one of us .
Disappointed ?
No .
Proud .
Very proud .
Hello .
The countess ?
Just a moment .
The Duchess of Chambro .
Hello , Your Grace .
Yes , Your Grace .
Well , how did you know I was here ?
Oh , the marquis .
Yes , Your Grace , I see .
Dinner tomorrow at your palace ?
Well , I 'd be delighted .
Listen , Lily , when you come home , slip up the back way .
L ... I can 't talk now , but do what I tell you .
And listen , Lily .
Do you know what that darn dog of yours did ?
So he really did ?
How charming .
Well , my compliments to the duke .
Good-bye .
There you are .
The scandal is on .
Oh .
Countess , I 'm sorry .
If you think it 's best for you to go , well ...
I think that 's very nice of you .
Yes , very nice .
- I think we should have a cocktail .
- Ah .
The representative of police wants to know ... how much money you had , Monsieur Filiba .
Uh ... Oh , yes , yes .
I had exactly 20,000 lira .
I just cashed a traveler 's check and I put the money in my wallet .
Why did you let , uh , this man in , Monsieur Filiba ?
Well , he knocked on the door .
You see , I was expecting two , uh ... two business associates .
And then what happened , Monsieur Filiba ?
Well , I said , " Come in " .
And there he was .
Fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns .
He said , " Good evening . I 'm the doctor " .
I said , " Doctor ? " He said , " Yes , the doctor .
I 've come to see about your tonsils " .
The representative of police like to know ... if there is anything wrong with your tonsils , Monsieur Filiba .
No .
That 's what I tried to tell him .
Well , one word led to another . He was really a very charming fellow .
We talked for about ten minutes .
What did you talk about , Monsieur Filiba ?
About tonsils .
So then I said to myself , " All right .
If he wants to look at them , let him .
There 's no harm in that " .
Then he said , " Say ah " .
And so I said , " Ah " .
And that 's all I remember .
When I woke up , I still had my tonsils , but my pocketbook was gone .
- Was it lots of money ?
- Oh , it must have been , Baron .
The gentleman occupied the royal suite .
Two fifty-three , five , seven and nine .
I think his name is , uh , Monsieur Filiba .
You 're not safe anywhere nowadays .
But please , Baron . We 're not supposed to say a word of it .
You won 't tell anybody I told you ?
- You can trust me .
- Thank you , Baron .
That 's hotel life .
In one room a man loses his wallet , and in another room , a man loses his head .
When I came here , it was for a little adventure , a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow .
But something 's changed me ... and it isn 't the champagne .
Oh , the whole thing 's so new to me .
I have a confession to make to you .
Baron , you are a crook .
You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three , five , seven and nine .
- May I have the salt ?
- Please .
- Thank you .
- The pepper too ?
- No , thank you .
- You 're very welcome .
Countess , believe me , before you left this room ,
I would have told you everything .
And let me say this with love in my heart .
Countess , you are a thief .
The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three , five , seven and nine ... is in your possession .
I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket .
In fact , you tickled me .
But your embrace was so sweet .
- Countess .
- Thank you .
- I like you , Baron . - I 'm crazy about you .
By the way , your pin .
- Thank you , Baron .
- Not at all .
There 's one very good stone in it .
What time is it ?
It was five minutes slow , but I regulated it for you .
I hope you don 't mind if I keep your garter .
Darling !
Oh , now , darling . Tell me ... Tell me all about yourself .
Who are you ?
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople ... and walked out with the Bank of Constantinople ?
- Monescu !
- Gaston Monescu .
Gaston !
I love you .
I loved you the moment I saw you .
I 'm mad about you .
My little shoplifter .
My sweet little pickpocket .
My darling .
Geneva . From Geneva comes the news ... that the famous international crook , Gaston Monescu , robbed the peace conference yesterday .
He took practically everything except the peace .
The police arrested him and confiscated all the stolen goods , but he managed to escape in an inexplainable manner .
This is the Paris police reporter speaking .
Ladies and gentlemen , this program comes to you ... through the courtesy of Colet and Company , manufacturers of the most famous perfumes in the world .
Remember , it doesn 't matter what you say , it doesn 't matter how you look . It 's how you smell . Thank you .
# Colet , Colet Colet and Company #
# Are makers of the best perfumes #
# If you and your beloved can 't agree # # Permit us to suggest perfumes #
# Cleopatra was a lovely tantalizer #
# But she did it with her little atomizer #
# We 'll make you smell like a rose #
# Every nose in Paris knows #
# Colet and Company # #
Well , I am sure , Madame Colet , if your husband were alive , the first thing he would do in times like these ... cut salaries .
Unfortunately , Monsieur Giron , business bores me to distraction .
Besides , I have a luncheon engagement . So I think we better leave the salaries just where they are .
Good-bye .
Good-bye , Madame Colet .
This one , Madame Colet , is only 3,000 francs .
Oh , no , that 's entirely too much .
- How ' bout that one ?
- Oh , this one , madame .
Well , that 's 125,000 francs .
But it 's beautiful .
I 'll take it .
Thank you , Madame Colet .
How do you do , Madame Colet ?
Good-bye , Madame Colet .
Yes , madame .
No , madame .
No , madame .
Yes , madame .
No , no , François .
I tell you no .
You see , François , marriage is a beautiful mistake ... which two people make together .
But with you , François , I think it would be a mistake .
Don 't be so downhearted , Major .
You 're not the only one I don 't love .
I don 't love François , either .
Madame will be ready in two minutes .
I know you don 't like me , Major .
To be perfectly frank , I dislike you ... intensely .
But since we have to be in each other 's company this evening ... we might just as well make conversation .
Well , Major , what 's your answer ?
For heaven 's sake , man , say something !
Tonsils .
# He 's late # Good-bye .
You should be ashamed of yourselves .
Two men of your standing always quarreling .
Well , he started it .
But you 're the more intelligent one .
- That 's true .
- Then why did you do it ?
Because I hate him .
Because I love you .
You should have more self-control .
- You were in the army . - Well , he was in the navy .
Good-bye .
I want you to go out and apologize ... immediately .
See here , my good man .
You 've been saying good-bye for the last half hour and staying on .
I wish you 'd say , " How do you do , " and go .
Well , he left .
I tell you , apologizing is a gift . # His royal highness will soon be here #
- My bag !
- Your bag ?
- Yes , my bag .
- Well , well , well , didn 't you take it with you ?
- Apparently not .
Don 't you know where it is ?
- No , no , I 'm sorry .
- But you saw it here .
- Yes , yes , I saw it .
- Then where is it ?
- Shh !
It couldn 't have walked out by itself .
- Yes , monsieur .
- I , uh ... I would like to look at some , uh ...
- Good morning , Major .
- Good morning .
I would like to look at , uh ... at some , uh ... some cuff links .
Very well , sir .
- Nice day , Major . - Yeah .
Mm-hmm .
- You 're looking fine , Major .
- Now see here , my good man . I 've had just about enough of your insulting remarks .
Here , monsieur .
Pretty , isn 't it ?
I don 't agree with this review at all .
I thought Martini 's singing was adequate , but to call him a great singer ... ridiculous .
- Remember when we saw him a year ago in Munich ?
- A year ago ?
- It can 't be that long .
- Yes .
Don 't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the royal palace ?
And you made it into a lamp for my night table .
I remember the lamp , I remember the night table ... and I remember the night .
Everything will be all right again .
Prosperity is just around the corner .
Gaston !
Read this .
The description fits .
That 's our bag .
Twenty thousand francs .
If I sold it , I would get ... Well , it 's worth 40,000 at the most .
She paid probably 60,000 .
If I sold it , I would get 5,000 .
Well , darling , then I 'd be honest about it and return it to the lady .
- And take the 20,000 francs ?
- Right .
Sweetheart , what day is today ?
- The 14th of May .
- And tomorrow is the 15th .
- And the day after tomorrow ...
- The six ...
We 'll go to Venice , to the same hotel .
And we 'll take the royal suite .
- Two fifty-three , five ...
- Seven and nine .
No , I 'm sorry , but that 's not the bag .
Next , please .
Hello .
Yes .
No , no . No , it was not insured .
But right now it 's too late .
I may lose it again ?
But I haven 't found it yet .
No , no , I 'm sorry .
Good-bye .
- Yes ?
- So you lost a handbag , madame ?
- Yes .
- And it had diamonds in the back ?
- Yes .
- And diamonds in the front ?
- Yes .
- Diamonds all over ?
- Well , have you found it ?
- No ! But let me tell you :
Any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag ...
- Phooey , phooey , and phooey !
Phooey , phooey , and phooey !
His phooey is worse than his bite .
Oh , I must apologize for entering unannounced , but if I am not mistaken , Madame Colet ?
Yes .
Will you be good enough to look at this bag , madame ? Why , yes .
Yes , that 's it .
Jacques !
Yes , madame ?
Dismiss all the people in the hall .
Say the bag 's been found .
Very well , madame .
Where did you ...
Where did you find it ?
- You know the main staircase in the opera ?
- Yes . - Then you go to the left , there is a landing .
- Yes .
- Then you go into the foyer .
- Yes .
- And as you leave the foyer , there is a little niche .
- I know that niche .
- And in that niche there is a statue of Venus .
- I remember .
- You like that statue ?
- Not particularly .
Neither do I. That 's where I found it .
I don 't know how I could have lost it there .
I was nowhere near that niche .
Oh , that 's strange .
Maybe ...
Are you sure this is your bag ?
But of course it is .
Are you doubting me ?
Not in the least , madame .
But , you see , this is a very expensive bag , and one has to be careful .
Well , I am Madame Colet .
And I am Monsieur La Valle , if you 'll allow me to introduce myself .
How do you do , Monsieur La Valle ?
The pleasure is mine , madame .
One purse , empty . One vanity case ...
But really , monsieur , this isn 't necessary .
Please , madame , I believe in doing things correctly .
Shall we continue ?
Two hairpins , one cigarette lighter , one box of real matches ... oh , yes , and this letter from Major ...
- You didn 't read it ?
- Naturally I did .
- Oh .
- You needn 't be embarrassed , madame .
A lady as charming as you would and should get love letters .
Monsieur La Valle .
But one suggestion . Not the major .
I don 't mind his grammatical mistakes , I will overlook his bad punctuation , but the letter has no mystery , no bouquet .
And one lipstick .
Scarlet , number four !
What 's wrong now ?
With your skin I prefer crimson .
- Too much blue in crimson .
- But that 's what you need !
Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no .
I disagree with you completely .
I tried it once .
- What shade of powder do you use ?
- Peaches and cream .
- That 's too dark .
- But do you realize that I have light eyes ?
But , Madame Colet , that is a question of eye shading .
I can straighten that out in two seconds .
Come in .
The major .
I 'm sorry , monsieur , but madame had better not see anyone .
The bag has just been found , and the reaction of relief from her excitement and strain ...
- is just a little too much for her .
- But ...
It 's nothing very serious , but all the same , we 'd better not take any chances .
- Just as you say , Doctor .
- Thank you , Major .
- Good day , Doctor . - Good day , Major .
- Oh , Jacques , has the bag been found ?
- Yes , Major .
- Is madame feeling well ?
- No , Major .
Is madame seeing anybody this afternoon , this evening or even tomorrow ?
- No , Major .
- You may shut the door , Jacques .
Well , that leaves you holding the bag .
Good-bye .
I think I 'd better be going .
Good-bye , Madame Colet .
Good-bye , Monsieur La Valle .
Oh , yes .
Well , this is a rather delicate matter , and I ... I don 't want to , uh ...
You see , if you ... if you read my advertisement carefully , you ... you would have noticed ...
In other words , it embarrasses you to offer me the 20,000-francs reward .
- Yes .
- Don 't be embarrassed .
I 'll take it .
I need the money .
I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter , but you know , madame , the stock market , a bank crash ... To make a long story short , a member of the nouveau poor .
Then I 'm glad I lost the bag .
I 'll write you the check immediately .
- Madame Colet ?
- Yes , Monsieur La Valle .
- Do you know my first name ? - No , what is it ?
Tell me .
Gaston .
- And you know what I would like you to do with that check ?
- What ?
Make it out to cash .
As you like .
Now , where can that checkbook be ?
Dear me , dear me .
She must have left it somewhere .
It 's always the same .
When you 're looking for something , you can 't find it .
I can 't find that checkbook .
I should have discharged her six months ago .
I really don 't know what to do .
Monsieur La Valle , I 'm very sorry , but ...
- Eighteenth century .
- Yes . Early eighteenth century .
I should say about ... 1730 .
Right .
- Beautiful specimen .
- It is beautiful , isn 't it ?
But I got tired sleeping in antiques .
- So I gave it to my secretary .
- Oh .
This used to be my secretary 's room .
I see .
She must 've been very happy here .
Too happy .
That 's why I discharged her .
Oh , that 's terrible .
Isn 't that wonderful ?
You see ...
Let me tell you something , madame ... as a man who 's had all kinds of secretaries .
I wonder if she put that checkbook in the safe .
Why , I hardly think so , but let 's look .
No .
No , it isn 't here .
Well , what do you think of that ?
A hundred thousand francs .
You know , I hadn 't the slightest idea .
But , madame , you keep 100,000 francs in your safe ... at home ?
- You think that 's too much ?
- No .
Not enough .
In times like these , when everything is uncertain , every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune ... within arm 's reach .
Mm-hmm .
That sounds sensible .
Mm-hmm .
Yes , very sensible .
- Very , very clever .
- Madame .
I think you deserve a good scolding .
First you lose your bag ...
- Then I mislay my checkbook .
- Then you use the wrong lipstick .
- And how I handle my money .
- It 's disgraceful !
Tell me , Monsieur La Valle , what else is wrong ?
Everything !
Madame Colet , if I were your father ... which , fortunately , I am not ... and you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs , I would give you a good spanking , in a business way , of course .
What would you do if you were my secretary ?
The same thing .
You 're hired .
Speaking for the board of directors , as well as for myself , if you insist in times like these on cutting the fees ... of the board of directors , then we resign .
Speaking for Madame Colet , as well as for myself , resign .
Very well .
We 'll , uh , think it over , Monsieur La Valle .
Now , Monsieur La Valle , as for Madame Colet 's life insurance , it totals one million francs .
There 's 500,000 fire insurance ... and 400,000 against burglary .
Then we 'd better increase the burglary insurance to 850,000 francs .
Thank you , Monsieur La Valle .
- No potatoes , Monsieur La Valle ?
- No potatoes .
Yes , Monsieur La Valle .
Yes , Monsieur La Valle .
No , Monsieur La Valle .
Oh , maybe , Monsieur La Valle .
Is this what you mean , Monsieur La Valle ?
Absolutely , Madame Colet .
Now , Monsieur La Valle , please .
Frankly , madame , I 'm too tired .
Don 't you want to come down and join the party ?
Just a little tango ?
No ? Oh , you and your messy old papers and contracts ... and money , money , money .
All those uninteresting things .
They 're very interesting to me , madame .
And somebody in this house should worry about money .
No , really , I have to be up early in the morning .
New paragraph .
Furthermore , it is madame 's wish that while half of the interest ... shall be deposited as usual in madame 's account , the other half , contrary to custom , shall be delivered in cash into madame 's personal custody .
Darling , that means that on the second ofJune ... we shall have 850,000 francs .
- And her jewelry is worth a fortune .
- No jewelry .
Hands off jewelry .
If we 're broke , all right .
I can pick up a million-franc necklace .
But in times like these , when we 're doing a cash business , why take a chance with jewelry ?
Gaston , I know you 're awfully busy , and , well , I don 't wanna trouble you , but she has one little necklace ...
You know the one with the seed pearls ?
It 's so quiet and simple .
- It 'd go just beautifully with my neck .
- Hmm .
Come in .
Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Vautier for a moment .
Very well , Jacques .
Come in .
Good morning , madame .
Good morning , mademoiselle .
Please .
- Please .
- Oh , thank you , madame .
You 've had your breakfast ?
Oh , but of course you have .
Oh , yes , madame .
You see , I have to get up very early .
My little brother goes to school .
You see , Mother is dead .
Yes , that 's the trouble with mothers .
First you get to like them , and then they die .
Oh , thanks .
Thank you .
And now , mademoiselle , the reason I asked you to come ...
- Two lumps , madame ? - Please .
Thank you .
Oh , may I ?
- Now , mademoiselle .
- Yes , madame ?
You see , uh ... Not a word to Monsieur La Valle .
About what ?
Potatoes .
He doesn 't want me to eat them , and naturally I don 't want to upset him .
Naturally not .
Now , mademoiselle ... in the short time that you have been Monsieur La Valle 's secretary , have you noticed any change in him ?
Well , uh , yes and no .
To me he seems rather nervous .
Nervous ?
Uh-huh , he smokes too much .
No . No , he works too much .
He 's chained to his desk .
Too much detail .
Now , uh , if you could take over some of his work ...
So he wouldn 't be so confined to his office .
Yes . And he 'd have a little more time for ...
- For all the really important things .
- Right ! I 'll do my best , madame , even if I have to work every night .
Oh , no .
No , my dear child .
That 's ridiculous .
You go home as usual , 5 : 00 every day .
Now , I 'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant .
I insist .
It 'll be nice for your little brother too .
5 : 00 , remember .
Very well , madame .
Thank you .
- And , my dear ,
- Yes , madame ?
- How much is your salary ?
- Three hundred francs .
Well , in times like these , most people are cutting salaries , but in your case , suppose we say ... 350 ?
Madame , you are just too sweet for words .
- Well , what does she want ?
- You . And she 's willing to pay as high as 50 francs .
- What ?
- But it 's not enough !
Oh , no , François .
Don 't be silly .
I have nothing against you .
Oh , no , that 's all forgotten .
What ?
Not this week , François .
Business , François .
Business .
You 're talking like a child .
You know exactly what we 're here for and what it 's all about .
This woman has more than jewelry !
Did you ever take a good look at her , um ...
- Certainly .
- They 're all right , aren 't they ?
Beautiful .
What of it ?
Let me tell you something .
As far as I 'm concerned , her whole sex appeal is in that safe .
Gaston , let 's open it right now .
Let 's get away from here .
- I don 't like this place .
- No , no , sweetheart .
There 's more sex appeal coming on the first of the month .
It 's only ten days ... 850,000 francs .
Darling , remember , you are Gaston Monescu .
You are a crook .
I want you as a crook .
I love you as a crook .
I worship you as a crook .
Steal , swindle , rob !
Oh , but don 't become one of those useless , good-for-nothing gigolos .
Good-bye , Gaston , darling .
Good-bye , sweetheart .
Well , I 'll leave you alone with that lady , but if you behave like a gentleman , I 'll break your neck .
Come in .
Oh , Monsieur La Valle .
- Yes , madame ?
- Has Mademoiselle Vautier gone ?
- Yes .
- Oh , that 's too bad .
I wanted to ask her to ask you ... if you would be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight .
Good night , madame .
And let me tell you again , you dance like a dream .
- Oh , no .
It 's the way you lead .
- No , madame , it 's the way you follow .
- No , monsieur .
- Yes , madame .
Well , the evening 's still young .
Let 's go down to the living room and talk it over .
- Good night , Monsieur La Valle .
- Good night , Madame Colet .
- Good night .
- Good night .
Monsieur Giron , madame will be with you presently .
Very well , Jacques .
No , Captain ...
Now , Major , you mustn 't monopolize Monsieur La Valle .
Please .
May I present Monsieur La Valle .
Madame Viton ,
Mademoiselle Du Lac , Monsieur Le Grand .
A pleasure , monsieur .
- This is Madame Boucher , Monsieur Filiba .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- Monsieur La Valle .
Monsieur La Valle .
Lady Claremont .
That 's that Monsieur La Valle .
La Valle ?
Who is Monsieur La Valle ?
I don 't know .
She says he 's her secretary .
Oh ?
So .
And he says he 's her secretary .
Maybe I 'm wrong .
Maybe he is her secretary .
- Excuse me .
- Certainly .
Pardon me , monsieur , but I have the feeling we 've met somewhere before .
Sorry . I don 't seem to recall the occasion .
- No , I 'm afraid ...
- Oh , I must be mistaken .
I beg your pardon .
That man never met me , and he knows it .
Trying to make social connections .
Monsieur Giron , I 'm so busy .
Must I be bothered with all those papers now ?
I 'm sorry , madame , but there are still certain matters ... which you should attend to yourself .
And I personally would not care to refer them to , uh ... to , uh ...
Monsieur La Valle ?
Madame , I have enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than 40 years .
I was a school friend of your husband 's .
I know .
Madame , may I ask you , who is this Monsieur La Valle ?
Where does he come from ?
What is he ?
He 's my secretary . I hope that answers all your questions , Mr. Giron .
I suppose you know what Paris is saying about Countess Falconier ... and her chauffeur ?
Jacques .
Yes , madame ?
Ask Monsieur La Valle to come in for a moment , please .
Now , please .
Please calm yourself .
I 'm like that .
L-I can 't help it .
I know I never met that man , and yet ...
- La Valle ?
- La Valle .
La Valle .
You know , if I like a man , I remember him .
And if I don 't like him , I never forget him .
In a nutshell , madame , it is little things like that that drive me crazy .
Excuse me .
- Monsieur La Valle ?
- Yes , Monsieur Filiba ?
Did we ...
No . No .
And yet ...
Pardon me .
Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room .
At once , Jacques .
We 'll continue later .
Now see here , my good man .
Let us face the facts .
I 'm giving a dinner party , and one man turned me down at the last minute .
- Have you a dinner jacket ?
Madame ?
Will you be good enough to go over these papers with Monsieur Giron ?
I shall be delighted .
And so will Monsieur Giron .
Well .
Monsieur La Valle , there are several questions I 've been wanting to ask you for quite a while .
- I understand you are from Marseilles .
- Mm-hmm .
In that case , you must be related to the La Valles of Marseilles .
Just a minute , please .
I hope you 'll find those figures ... correct .
- I hope so too .
- Monsieur La Valle ,
I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more ... For more than 40 years .
So madame told me .
And I have known the La Valles of Marseilles ... for more than 30 years .
Ten ...
Monsieur La Valle , you seem to be persistently evading my questions .
And you , Monsieur Giron , seem to be persistently disturbing ... my examination of your report .
Examination ?
Monsieur La Valle , what are you insinuating ?
I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than 40 years .
How long have you enjoyed the confidence of madame ?
Three weeks , I believe .
- Two weeks and three days .
- Ha !
Ha ! Are you insinuating anything , Monsieur Giron ?
- No , no , not at all .
- Well , that 's fine .
Then you 're not insinuating that I 'm evading your questions , and I 'm not insinuating that you won 't let me examine your report .
I was only asking if you were related to the La Valles of Marseilles .
And I was only asking you to let me examine your report without interruption .
I don 't see why any man should get excited ... because he 's asked about his hometown .
And I don 't see any reason for any man to get nervous ... because someone checks over the figures of his report .
Monsieur La Valle ! Are you insinuating this is not an honest report ?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous .
- Nervous ? Why should I be nervous ?
- I don 't know , Monsieur Giron .
Are you trying to say there is anything in these figures to make me nervous ?
No , not at all .
- We 'll keep the papers here .
- But ... And tomorrow I 'll call you at your office and tell you all about ... the La Valles of Marseilles .
- I , uh ...
And there won 't be any tea party to interrupt us .
Good-bye , Monsieur Giron .
Do you know who 's here ?
Come in .
Monsieur La Valle , Monsieur Filiba would like very much to see you .
In a moment .
- Filiba ?
- Yes , Filiba .
- Venice , Grand Hotel , room two fifty-three ... - Five , seven and nine !
Yes .
Now , don 't worry .
- I wanted to say good-bye to you .
- Good-bye , Monsieur Filiba .
But ... before I go and before I say good-bye , I want to ask you one question .
- Have you ever been in Venice ?
- No . - You 've never been in Venice ?
- No .
- Have you ever been in Vienna ?
- No . - Amsterdam ?
Constantinople ?
- No .
No . - You 've never been in Constantinople ?
- No . - But you have been in Venice ?
- Yes .
Then let me tell you , Venice can 't compare with Constantinople .
I don 't care what you say . In Constantinople at least you have streets , sultans , pashas , turbans ...
- And harems , hmm ?
- All kinds .
Well , Constantinople .
Elysee 7689 .
We have to clear out .
Railroad station ?
Ticket office , please .
- Did he recognize you ?
- No , no , not yet . Two tickets to Berlin , first-class and sleeper .
Night train .
Right .
Right .
Leave them in the name of el señor Ignacio Fernandez .
Right .
Thank you .
- Spanish passports .
- Correct . Now the train leaves ...
At 12 : 20 , I know .
Roquet 2471 .
Two more days and we 'd have had 750,000 francs more .
We 'll have to take what 's here .
A bird in hand is worth two in jail .
Hello , is this the Spanish consulate ?
This is la señora de Ignacio Fernandez .
- How long will it take you to clean up the place ?
- I don 't know . Fortunately she has a dinner engagement tonight .
I 'll meet you at the station , midnight .
Hello .
Yes ?
What ?
You found a handbag ?
- Well , you 're three weeks too late .
- See you at the Berlin Express .
By the way , how 's your German ?
Marchand 2911 .
Hello .
Is this the Petit Flower Shop ?
I want you to take five dozen roses ... deep red roses ... and I want you to put them in a basket ... and send this basket tomorrow morning to Madame Colet .
And attach a card .
" In memory of the late Monsieur La Valle "
Tomorrow morning , 10 : 00 .
Yes .
What ?
Oh .
Charge it to Madame Colet .
Yes .
Thank you .
Yes , madame ?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow , Monsieur La Valle ?
Well , we 'll have breakfast in the garden together .
Mm-hmm .
- Then horseback riding together .
- Mm-hmm .
- Then lunch in the bois .
- Together .
- Then , I would say , a little nap . - To ...
How do you like my new dress ?
- Beautiful .
- Hair ? Marvelous .
Lipstick ?
Crimson .
Correct .
Good night .
Good night .
Good night .
Good-bye .
- Madame ?
- Yes ?
Are you staying out late ?
Why do you ask ?
Do I have to answer ?
No .
Yes , Jacques ?
The car is waiting , madame .
I won 't need the car .
I 'm not going .
Very well , madame .
- Jacques .
- Yes , Monsieur La Valle ?
Madame has changed her mind .
She 'll be down in a minute .
Very well , monsieur .
But I told you , I don 't want to go .
But you have an engagement , and I don 't want people to talk .
- Talk ?
About me ?
About us ?
- Precisely .
Afraid I 'm ruining your reputation , Monsieur La Valle ?
No , yours , madame .
Monsieur La Valle , I have a confession to make to you .
You like me .
In fact , you 're crazy about me .
Otherwise , you wouldn 't think about my reputation .
Isn 't that so ?
But , incidentally , I don 't like you .
I don 't like you at all .
And I wouldn 't hesitate one instant to ruin your reputation ...
Like that .
- You wouldn 't ?
- No , I wouldn 't .
Like that ?
Like that .
I know all your tricks .
And you 're going to fall for them .
So you think you can get me ?
Any minute I want .
You 're conceited .
But attractive .
- Now let me say ...
- Shut up .
Kiss me .
Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments .
Hello ?
Well , I 'll try him again .
Yes .
He 's in his office , but he 's busy .
Madame Colet ?
She 's still here , but she 's busy too .
Well , I 'll ring again .
- Yes , Jacques ?
- Monsieur Giron is downstairs .
Tell him I can 't see him now .
Impossible .
And , Jacques , dismiss the car .
Madame is not going .
Yes , Monsieur La Valle .
- Jacques .
- Yes , madame ?
Yes , madame ?
Don 't dismiss the car .
I 'll be down in a few minutes .
Yes , madame .
I want you to stay , Mariette .
You 've got to stay .
You can 't go now .
- I must go .
- I 'm crazy about you .
- I know it .
- I love you .
- I believe you .
- Then why do you want to go ?
Because I want to make it tough for you .
Oh .
We have a long time ahead of us , Gaston .
Weeks , months , years .
Eleven o 'clock .
Gobelins 7879 .
Hello ?
Oh , darling !
Oh , darling , it 's good to hear your voice . I thought you 'd never call .
Well , I tried to get you .
What ?
Tomorrow morning ?
Why ?
Of course .
Uh-huh .
Uh-huh .
No doubt about it .
It 's that secretary .
Funny the kind of men women fall for .
No color , no sparkle .
But dependable .
The type they marry .
You know , I 'm not the marrying type .
I like to take my fun and leave it .
Nice suit .
- You like it ?
- Smart . London , eh ?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe .
Mmm , I thought so .
You know , he 's really not such a bad fellow .
- No , just dull .
- Insignificant .
He 's a secretary .
He always was a secretary , always will be .
Funny .
The first time I saw him , I thought he was a doctor .
Tonsils .
Positively tonsils .
I 'm very sorry , but this is not the time , Monsieur Giron .
- I 've got to see you .
- But not now .
Right now !
It 's very important , Monsieur La Valle .
It may be important to you , Monsieur Giron .
No , to you ,
Monsieur Monescu .
Mariette , Mariette , please , please believe us .
No , no , no . Please . It 's absolutely ridiculous , and I don 't believe it .
But you have no idea ...
I 'm tired anyway , so please leave me alone . Good night .
I had a lovely time .
So I said to myself , " All right . If he wants to look at ' em , let him look at ' em .
There 's no harm in that " .
Then he said , " Say ah " and I said " ah , " and that 's all I can remember .
- You will pack your things at once .
- Yes , monsieur .
And you will be out of here by tomorrow morning .
Very well , monsieur .
- Otherwise , I will call the police .
- Yes , monsieur .
- Monsieur Giron ?
- What is it ?
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than 40 years .
You must be a man of about 65 .
- Well ?
- Let 's see ...
You will be exactly 87 when you come out of prison .
- What do you mean ?
- You say I 'm a crook .
- I know it ! - Then why didn 't you call the police ?
Who don 't you call the police ?
I 'll tell you why , you crook , you .
- Monsieur ...
- Monescu .
- Monsieur Monescu . - Just call me Gaston .
Good-bye , Adolphe .
Don 't you dare to call me Adolphe !
Are you insane ?
You have to get out of here at once .
She may be back at any minute .
What time is your rendezvous ?
- Now , Lily ...
- Yes , Monsieur Colet ?
- You have to get out of here .
- That 's what I 'm here for , to get out .
I want to get away from here , from you , just as fast as I can ... and as far as 100,000 francs will take me .
- Sixty-five , thirty-five to the left .
- Don 't you realize ... I wouldn 't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth .
Seventy-six , eighty-four .
What has she got that I haven 't got ?
- You must listen to me .
- Shut up . Don 't make up any stories .
- But , Lily ...
- Don 't you dare lie to me !
I know you love me .
Why don 't you say something ?
Come on , be brilliant .
Talk yourself out of it .
Bluff yourself in .
Shut up , you liar , you !
This is what I want .
This is real ... money , cash .
Good evening , madame .
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman 's room , where does she put them ?
On the ... On the night table .
But I don 't want to be a lady .
May I ?
Oh , let me have a little fun .
Please .
- Sixty-five .
- Thirty-three .
No . Thirty-five .
Oh .
Hmm .
Thirty-five to the left .
You know , François thinks you are a very remarkable man .
- He was at dinner tonight .
- Mm-hmm .
- Seventy-six .
- Mariette . Yes , Gaston ?
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed ?
I wouldn 't say anything .
I would act . - Call the police ?
- Instantly .
Mm-hmm .
But why talk about robbery on a night like this ?
You look beautiful .
Thank you .
- Mariette .
- Yes , Gaston ?
You have been robbed .
For years .
And not a hundred thousand francs , but millions .
And you know who did it ?
Adolphe . - Adolphe ?
- AdolpheJ . Giron .
- And you expect me to believe that ?
- Naturally not .
But I expect the police to believe it .
- No .
- Why not ?
- He 's a thief .
He 's a criminal . - I don 't believe it .
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it ?
It would be a terrible scandal , wouldn 't it ?
- Giron ?
- Yes , Giron .
Chairman of the board of directors of Colet and Company .
Honorary president of the Orphans ' Asylum .
AdolpheJ . Giron , distinguished citizen .
Well , shall I call the police ?
I see .
You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail .
But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up , a self-made crook , then you say ,
" Call the police .
Put him behind bars .
Lock him up " .
Very well , madame .
I am Gaston Monescu .
The police will be delighted to verify my identity .
Gaston , did you take the money ?
Yes .
You wanted a hundred thousand francs ... and I thought you wanted me .
I came here to rob you , but unfortunately I fell in love with you ,
Mariette .
Why did you take the money ?
Madame , the only thing that seems to stand between you and romance ... is a hundred thousand francs .
Well , he didn 't take it .
I took it , all by myself .
Now you can have your romance .
I think you 'd better go .
Ever had a romance with a crook ?
- I beg your pardon ?
- Let me give you a little advice .
When you embrace him , be sure to put on gloves .
It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Vautier , or whatever your name is , I thank you for your free advice , but I must ask you to go .
- You have your money .
- I don 't want your money !
You wanted to buy him for 50 francs .
Well , you can have him for nothing !
- And you ...
Leave me alone !
- Lily . You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her .
And you !
You paid 125,000 francs for a handbag !
Well , you can pay 100,000 for him .
Good-bye , Madame Colet ... and company .
Good-bye .
Good-bye .
It could have been marvelous .
Divine .
Wonderful .
But tomorrow morning , if you should wake out of your dreams ... and hear a knock and the door opens , and there , instead of a maid with a breakfast tray ... stands a policeman with a warrant , then you 'll be glad you are alone .
But it could have been glorious .
Lovely .
Divine .
But that terrible policeman .
Good-bye .
Do you know what you 're missing ?
No .
That 's what you 're missing .
With the compliments of Colet and Company .
Gaston !
Paper , morning paper ...
Morning Tribune paper .
How are we gonna know this guy ?
Remember , the man in Mike 's car gotta see him too .
Oh , that 's all right .
I 'm going to kiss him , and how .
Good , you might as well make him happy .
It 'll be the last pair of lips that hit him .
No .
You don 't think he could have gone away , do you ?
Here he comes now .
Thanks , handsome .
I just couldn 't pass you up .
Believe it or not , I never saw her in my life before .
I must have overlooked something .
Bloody shame , sir .
Close to annoying .
Right under me very nose .
Your nose ?
I 'll get the car , sir .
Save ' em .
Okay this time , Mr Avery ?
How was it for you , George ?
Okay .
Oh , Ray .
Could we do it again ?
Number 10 .
Up high !
Ninety-nine !
Quiet .
Do you wanna move in and take a close-up at the top of the stairs ?
No , that was terrible .
I 'll make it over .
Yes , sir .
We 'll do it again , folks .
All right , scene 99 .
Let 's run it over .
All of it .
Move that car back here .
Hold it !
Come on !
Take it easy .
Mr. Brent ... when you dive this time , let 's have less gymnastics .
Okay , let 's go .
Come on , folks .
Move that one over there ...
What 's the matter ?
What 's that ?
What 's the matter ?
Stand back , everybody .
Call a doctor .
Come on , give me a hand .
Let 's get him to his dressing-room .
We won 't need a doctor , George .
He 's dead .
Dead ?
Round up every man that had a gun .
get the property man and find out who loaded those guns .
And see that the body isn 't touched .
I 'm going to phone the front office .
Yes , sir . All right , everybody . Line up over there .
And all you fellas with guns stand over there .
Keep that door closed .
And see that no one leaves the stage and no one comes in .
Yes .
My dear Mr Little ,
Since I read your scenario I have come to the absolutely conclusion
That your name , Mr Little , fits you something beautiful .
And furthermore and yet besides
Bahhh .
Yes ?
Oh , yes , Mr Avery .
Just a minute .
It 's Mr Avery .
Tell him to finish on schedule .
He 's two days behind already .
Talking to me is a waste in time .
But he says it 's important .
That 's the problem .
He 's too important entirely .
Hello .
What ?
Brent ?
Shot ?
Dead ?
Oy , that 's going to cost me a fortune .
What a calamity .
Quick !
Call Steiner .
Tell him Brent was killed , shot . What a calamity , what a calamity .
I 'll get it , Bill . Thanks .
Yes ?
Myles Brent was shot on the set .
Killed !
Mr Grossmith has gone to the stage .
I 'll be right there .
Myles Brent .
Killed .
On general principal , not a bad idea .
Except that he happens to be one of our stars .
Get back to your office and do what you can to keep the papers off this until we hear what happened .
Don 't give out any story until you hear from me .
Sure , but rescue me as soon as possible .
They 'll be on my neck just as soon as the police get the news .
Miss Molly .
Yes ? Phone the brigade on the lot .
And tell them not to let anyone in or out until they hear from me .
Very well .
Thanks .
Hey , why don 't you watch where I 'm going ?
What 's the hurry , gumshoe ?
Myles Brent 's been shot .
Now there 's a job that should have been done years ago .
Oh ...
You won 't have to rewrite any stuff for The Death Kiss now .
Say , Marcia was on the set with him , wasn 't she ?
Sure , but I don 't think she did it .
What stage ?
Three .
Drop this stuff in my office , will you ?
Myles Brent , huh ?
Picture actor .
My wife always liked him .
I had that kind of trouble too .
Come on , let 's go .
All right , fellas , here 's something hot .
Myles Brent killed .
Shot .
Sound Stage number 3 . Tonart Studio .
Operator .
Operator .
Hey , that 's the Evening Star phone .
You 're telling me ?
Give me the journal , please .
Hello , Tonart ?
I want Max Hill in the publicity department .
Come on , snap him .
You know me , Connelly I never held out on the Evening Star yet .
Yeah , I know all about your deadline .
You 'll get the pack .
Call me back .
Never mind , I 'll get it . Yeah .
Yes , Morris , I know .
But can I help it if he 's shot in the morning ?
You gotta take those things as they come .
Yeah , I 'm going over there right away .
The police oughta be here now .
Call me back in ten minutes .
Hey , come back here .
Pull down that door .
Ambulance coming .
Yeah .
Detective Lieutenant Sheehan , Homicide Squad .
Who 's in charge here ?
I 've been trying to get things straightened out for you .
My name is Steiner .
Studio manager .
What happened ?
Well , the company was shooting the scene during which several people fired guns at Brent .
And someone used real bullets , huh ?
People do get hurt that way .
That 's the director 's guess .
Oh , the director .
Did he happen to guess who did it ?
No .
That 's unfortunate .
Looks like we 'll have to do some guessing on our own . Come on , Hill , loosen up .
Did someone really bump him off ?
I tell you , I don 't know .
Then let us in on the lot so we can find out .
I can 't let anyone on the lot .
Marcia Lane was with him in the picture , wasn 't she ?
Sure , she was doing the lead opposite him .
Marcia , oh , his ex-wife .
That helps the story .
What 's the name of the picture ?
The Death Kiss .
The Death Kiss .
Gee , what a tie up .
Stage office on the phone .
Just a minute , boys , I 'll be right with you .
Eight men with guns ? Yes .
Well , it might have been an accident , but ...
Frank , you don 't think it was murder .
Darling , I don 't even know * * * Maybe he died of old age .
Maybe he never even existed at all .
Now you wait here .
I 'm gonna have a look around .
Yours .
You break it .
Nothing but blanks left in these guns .
Any other guns on the set ?
That 's all I know of .
You see , Captain , it 's strictly an accident .
Lieutenant Sheehan .
What 's your name ?
Leon A. Grossmith .
I 'm the president of this concern .
Well , what about it ?
Now look here , Sargeant .
Do you realize what this has cost me already ?
You have no idea .
It cost me up to now ... $ 239.351 .
Yeah , and it cost Brent his life .
Which also loses me money .
I can 't have no more Brent in my picture .
Pardon me , Lieutenant .
Mr Grossmith means to convey that this regrettable accident need not be converted into a Roman holiday for the rabble .
I assure you that Mr Grossmith feels deeply , very deeply the tragedy of this affair .
And his point is , naturally , not to throw consternation into that great and unseen army of Mr Brent 's admirers .
Now that is precisely what Mr Grossmith means .
That 's just what I was going to say .
Mr Steiner , Mr Steiner .
Pardon me .
What is it ?
The peckers are on my neck .
I 've got to tell them something .
There 's no use stalling any longer .
And they 've got a story now about a mysterious woman .
They don 't know themselves , but they say it makes a great story .
Tell them it was an accident .
They won 't believe it .
Then make them .
You don 't know those boys .
They 've got imagination .
I don 't care if they got fallen arches .
Tell them the Brent shooting was an unfortunate accident .
Yes .
Is that satisfactory to you , lieutenant ?
Nothing is satisfactory .
Here 's all he had on him .
Keep that .
Well , I 'm sorry to gum up the works .
But it wasn 't an accident .
It 's murder .
Murder , oy .
What a calamity .
How do you know ?
This is the bullet that killed him .
A 38 calibre , center fire .
All the guns the extras used were 45s .
And you can 't fire a 38 bullet through a 45 gun .
It 's an old Chinese principle .
Where did you get this ?
Out of the wall of the set .
Don 't you know better than to meddle in police matters ?
Oh , I 'm sorry .
I didn 't mean to meddle .
I just wanted to help .
You see , I like to dabble a bit in murder cases .
Well you just go and dabble some place else .
All right .
Who is he ?
One of our scenario writers , Franklyn Drew .
Oh , writes detective stories , I suppose .
Yes .
How did you know ?
They always do .
Well , this makes a difference .
Looks like we 've got a murder on our hands .
You go and get that assistant director .
That brilliant young man who said there were no other guns on this set .
Right .
Who is Marcia Lane ?
What ?
You don 't know who is Marcia Lane ?
Over a million dollars we spend advertising her all over the nation .
She was on set just a minute ago .
Let 's have a talk with her .
Howell , ask Miss Lane to come here . Yes , sir .
Steiner and the detective want to see Miss Lane immediately .
Well , hurry .
I 'm fluttering , sweetheart .
Bill .
Tell Miss Lane Steiner and the dick wanna see her .
Okay , chief .
Oh , Pete .
Rush Miss Lane over to Mr Steiner and the dick .
Now ?
No , next Tuesday , you sap . Oh .
Come on , get going .
Oh , all right .
Pardon me , Miss Lane .
Mr Steiner and the dick wanna see you .
Thank you .
You 're welcome .
What can they want with me ?
They just want to annoy you with a lot of routine questions .
They always question people like you first to give the guilty ones plenty of time to make up good alibis .
It 's part of the system .
Been going on for years .
Sit down , Miss Lane .
Thank you .
I don 't wish to be unpleasant but there are a few questions I 'd like to ask you .
Certainly .
How long have you and Brent been separated ?
We were divorced last May .
Why ? Well , I don 't quite see ...
Divorce is a matter of record , lieutenant .
I don 't think we have to go into that now .
Say , will you go up to your office and write " bad little boy " 500 times ?
When did you last quarrel with Myles Brent ?
I don 't remember .
Didn 't you love him ?
I wouldn 't answer that , Marcia .
Say , just what is your interest in this case ?
Personally I don 't care who killed Brent .
But I would like to know how it was done .
Besides that , I 'm ...
I 'm a friend of Miss Lane 's .
Wasn 't your name mentioned during the divorce proceedings ?
No .
Sorry to disappoint you .
What did you do with your gun , Miss Lane ?
My gun ?
Yes
I didn 't have a gun .
Didn 't you use one in the picture ?
No . But when you fired with the other ...
As a matter of fact if Miss Lane had fired she couldn 't have hit him .
She was around on the other side of the set when the shooting took place .
If you don 't lay off , I 'm gonna take you downtown .
What for ?
How do I know what for ?
Good , I was beginning to be afraid you might say something sensible .
Hey !
What are you trying to do there , huh ?
Don 't move , now .
I got you surrounded .
Don 't lie , now .
What did you try to hide there , huh ?
Why , nothing ...
We 'll see about that .
Hold this ...
Hey , wait a minute , wait a minute .
No , you don 't .
Yeah ?
Oh , yeah ?
This letter all ready to mail was found in Myles Brent 's pocket .
In this letter he told his lawyer that Marcia Lane refused to sign a release as beneficiary of his life insurance policy .
So you stand to collect $ 200.000 .
Miss Lane 's lawyer wouldn 't let her sign the release .
I know all about that .
It 's too bad you weren 't the one that was shot .
So that gives you a pretty nice motive .
No funny business , now . Come on , keep moving .
Here 's your man , chief .
I caught him red-handed .
He was trying to ditch this gun .
Look .
Look .
It 's loaded too . I tell you , I ...
Save your breath .
Put the braces on him , Owen .
Now ain 't that astounding ?
Something told me to take a squint around .
I sees ' im trying to ditch his gun , see ?
And I puts two and two together , I says to my ...
I says to myself , that 's the man .
I guess I used uncanny skill .
38 caliber and loaded .
It 's the gun all right .
Who is this fellow ?
Name 's Chalmers .
He was an extra on the set .
Why did you kill Brent ?
I never killed nobody .
You can 't alibi yourself out of this .
That 's the only 38 gun on the place .
You killed him .
Why ?
I tell you I didn 't .
You gotta listen to me .
Shut up .
You 'll have plenty of time to talk later on .
Do you know this man ?
Why , yes .
Everyone on the lot knows him .
He was head electrician for years .
How much did you pay him to kill Brent ?
Now wait a minute , lieutenant .
Why not pin the murder on the murderer ?
That 's not against the rules .
What are you talking about ?
Chalmers didn 't kill Brent .
How do you know ?
His gun hasn 't been fired .
How did this gun come to be loaded ?
I loaded it for Brent .
I lost my nerve .
So you had planned to kill Brent , huh ?
Yes , I wanted to kill him .
I had every reason in the world to kill him .
But he made no attempt .
So you can 't arrest him .
Not unless you want to make a fool of yourself .
You know , I 'm beginning to think you 're giving us the rash .
Prove it .
You 're a detective .
Take them off , Gulliver .
And maybe we 'll put them on him .
Well , we seem to be right back where we started .
Yes , perhaps you may have some very valuable suggestion .
Yes , I have .
What ?
The cameras were photographing when Brent was killed .
There might be something interesting on the film . It wouldn 't hurt to look .
Not bad .
How soon can we see the stuff ?
We could get a print in , say , three or four hours .
Can we get them going ?
Certainly .
Come , Mr Grossmith .
You take the name and address of every person on this set .
And warn them all about trying to leave town .
Right .
In any of your books , does the detective ever sock the novelist on the nose ?
No .
Write it in sometime .
Seems to me like a good idea .
Marcia .
Oh , Frank .
It won 't be very pleasant to see it all over again .
But it may help us a lot if we look carefully .
Is everybody here ?
I think so , Mr Grossmith .
Mr Steiner is in the projection booth .
He 'll be right in .
All right .
There he is now .
Are you ready , Mr Grossmith ?
Yes .
Mr Grossmith 's ready .
Quiet , please .
Quiet .
All right , turn it over .
Rolling .
Mark it .
Action .
Can I get your car , sir ? It 'll be right here .
Thanks handsome .
I just couldn 't pass you up .
Believe it or not , I 've never seen her in my life before .
I must have been overlooking something .
Bloody shame , sir .
Most annoying .
Right under my very nose .
Your nose ? I 'll get the car , sir .
Lights !
Turn on those lights !
Not hurt badly , but he must have received a sharp blow .
Yeah , it looks like it was done with a blunt instrument .
You know , I had an uncle once who was knocked out the same way .
Only he got hit with a shovel .
Whoever rocked your cradle overdid it .
A rouge smeered cigarette butt started it off .
Can you tell me if that 's studio makeup ?
Hard to say .
Perhaps we should call the makeup man to tell you .
Thanks .
How did it happen ?
I swear I don 't know .
I was leaning over the machine checking the focus I thought the building came down on me .
How about another print ?
Yeah , but we 'll take care of it this time .
There was something on .
And whoever cut it off didn 't want it to be seen .
If we have the laboratory man provide a new one right away .
Could you , Mr Glossmith ?
Why , yes , there 's no reason why we couldn 't .
Will you come with me ?
No , Hillicker will go with you .
I have another angle .
Where do I find this makeup man ?
Makeup department .
Clear out in the other end of the lot , just at the end of F street .
Sounds like a sleeper jump .
I 'll show you if you like . Thanks .
It 's a special panchromatic rouge of my own make .
Only two people on the lot are in the habit of using it .
Who are they ?
Miss Collins and Miss Lane .
Who 's Miss Collins ?
She 's one of our players .
Is she in this picture you 're photographing ?
No , I believe she 's working in The Night Riders and they 're out on location .
And the only other person on the lot that uses this rouge is Marcia Lane ?
As far as I know .
I see .
Thanks .
You 're welcome .
Wait a minute .
You have quite a stock of this rouge on hand , haven 't you ?
A few tubes of it .
Just as I thought .
Anybody could get at it .
Not very well .
All the makeup that is not in use is kept in the cabinets .
And the cabinets are locked ?
Yes .
It 's hidden .
Hello ?
Just a minute .
It 's for you .
Hello .
Yes , Hillicker .
How ?
All right .
You stick around there and see what you can find out .
Tell Steiner I 'll see him at his office .
The negative of that last scene has been ruined .
Someone poured acid in the container .
This thing gets more muddled every minute .
You 're telling me ?
How do I get to Steiner 's office ?
I 'll show you . Thanks .
And you 're not going with me .
Right at the end of the street .
Right .
You ought to have a map of this place .
Oh , Lieutenant .
You know that anybody could have taken the rouge from Miss Lane 's dressing room .
Sure .
A very interesting detail .
What do you make of it , Drew ?
Got me .
It 's more of a mystery than anything I ever wrote .
What I can 't undertsand is why anyone should want to murder Brent .
Not if it were a supervisor .
I don 't see why anybody wants to murder anybody .
It 's a silly idea .
You 're going to try and solve it ?
Yes , why not ?
It would be fun .
Besides ...
Marcia ?
Yes .
Oh , say , Tom .
If you see her , don 't say anything about that director .
It would only upset her .
No , no , no , of course not .
If I can help you , let me know .
Thanks .
Has anything been moved on the set ?
No . Police instructions were to leave everything undisturbed .
Well I 'm gonna have another look around .
I want to find out just how he was murdered .
And with what gun .
I got an idea how Brent was killed .
You wanna hear it ?
Some other time .
Better go home and sleep it off , Chalmers .
That 's what you think .
Chalmers don 't know anything , huh ?
But listen .
I 've been on the set and I 've been seeing things .
Yeah , snakes and pink elephants , I 'll bet .
Yeah , all right , be smart , be smart .
Now listen , you 're gonna come to me later .
I 'll see you in the morning . Go on home .
Poor boy .
All he does is cash his paycheck and drink it .
Wanna have a look around with me ?
No . I 'm not much of a detective .
Besides , Mrs Avery is waiting for me .
All right .
Good luck . Thanks .
Go find Sheehan . He 's someplace on the lot .
Bring him here .
Mr Drew .
Mr Drew , what happened ?
What happened ?
Here , here .
Swell , ain 't it ?
I made it myself .
Who 's in there ?
It 's all right , Sheehan .
Now ...
I found the gun that killed Brent .
Where ?
Right here in this lamp .
Why , it 's gone .
Probably got tired sitting there and decided to take a walk .
No , I 'm not kidding .
I came down to the set to take a look around .
Just by accident I noticed this ... this ... smudge on the lamp here .
So I looked inside .
Found a small Derringer fastened there .
Attached to an electromagnet .
There 's the wire it was connected to .
And I got a bump on my head that knocked me out .
This proves one thing .
Whoever killed Brent knew a lot about electricity .
Who 's in charge of these lamps ?
The head gaffer .
What 's that in English ?
The chief electrician .
Who is he ?
Al Payne .
Where can I find him ?
Tom will take you over .
Come here , kid , let me take a look at that head .
That 's all right .
Now listen .
You stop monkeying around with police matters .
It 's a tough racket .
That head of yours won 't stand another wallop .
Come on , let 's get going .
Mr Drew ...
The first thing I ask myself when I investigate a murder is whodunit .
That sounds logical .
And the next thing I ask myself is who could do it .
And then ?
And then I ask myself again who wanted to do it .
And how do you answer yourself ?
Well ...
I ain 't come to that yet .
You take Chalmers , for instance .
He didn 't like Brent .
Why shouldn 't he be an exception ?
He didn 't like Brent on account of Brent had him fired .
When was this ?
A couple of months ago .
When Chalmers was head gaffer they had an argument .
Head gaffer .
Yeah , Chalmers is an electrician , isn 't he ?
Yeah , Chalmers had a couple of drinks and him and Brent had an argument .
Say , Gully , you are a first-class gumshoe .
Investigator .
All right , investigator .
Right now , will you run up to the casting office investigate and find out where Chalmers lives ?
Sure , what are you gonna do ?
Put the finger ...
I mean apprehend him ?
Maybe .
You wanna come along ?
Oh , boy , I 'll say .
Got your gun ?
Yep .
Got my gun , my badge ...
We 'll need those .
Come on , let 's get going .
The director hasn 't anything to do with it .
The channel man really sets the lights .
You mean he tells you where to put the lights .
Yes .
When was this set lit ?
The afternoon before .
They rehearsed the scene with the principals so they wouldn 't hold when they called the extras .
Do you remember anything particular about that one light ?
To be truthful with you , we had a lot of arguments on that set .
Mr Steiner didn 't like the photography and he wanted more light .
Steiner ?
Was he there when it was rehearsed ?
Yes .
Who else ?
Well , they were all there with the exception of the extra people .
There were no extras there , huh ?
No , only Chalmers .
You know , he 's a sort of a privileged character around this lot .
He used to be our head gaffer .
Chalmers used to be an electrician ?
Yes .
Miss Lane felt sorry for him and made Mr Avery give him a bit in her picture .
Oh , Miss Lane got him the job . Yes .
Could you give me the address of the cameraman and Chalmers ' ?
Sure .
And , by the way ... If a writer by the name of Drew asks you anything don 't answer him .
* * * Well , you can 't keep me from hoping .
This is it .
Look .
It 's that Chalmers in trouble again .
Do you wish to see Mr Chalmers ?
Yes , is he in , Mrs ...
Miss Potts , and I don 't know anything at all about his comings and goings .
Doesn 't he answer the bell ?
No , he doesn 't .
I was just going in .
It 's cleaning day today , you know .
I suppose he 's lying stiff and the place all clotted up with gin bottles .
Let 's go in and have a look around , captain .
As a tenant , he wasn 't so bad until he lost his job . then he started acting queerlike .
See , I told you .
I laid it all down to him .
I said , Mr Chalmers ... my bungalow court isn 't an alcoholic ward .
As I thought .
Drunk again .
Well , this is the end .
This is no key to cure .
Out he goes .
I 'm sick and tired of his carryings on . The fellow 's dead .
Dead ?
Well , he didn 't think of me , no not him .
I suppose my $ 28.50 back rent was all spent in booze .
Did I have Chalmers spotted .
All I did was ask myself whodunit .
Poison , all right .
Familiar smelling stuff too .
Boy , that guy would drink anything that wasn 't too thick to chew .
Well , I guess this about washes up the case , huh , Mr Drew ?
Looks like suicide to you , eh , Gully ?
Sure .
I guess Sheehan would think so too .
He may be dumb , but he ain 't blind .
He 's not as dumb as he looks .
Do you wear a wristwatch , Gully ?
Huh ?
Do you wear a watch on your wrist ?
Well ... you see , it 's a present from the wife .
I gotta wear it .
Why do you wear it on your left wrist ?
Well , I use my right hand the most because I 'm right-handed .
Did you ever try to write with it on you right wrist ?
No .
Neither did , Chalmers .
Which makes this note a very interesting piece of fiction .
Say , Gully .
Come here .
Take a look in here .
Now , what do you see ?
A bottle of gin and a piece of ice .
What else ?
Use your powers of observation .
Oh , you mean that piece of lettuce in there .
Don 't you notice that little service door in the back has been left open ?
Whatever .
The icemen probably left it that way .
My wife says you can 't trust those icemen anyway .
If the iceman had left that little door open when he put in the fresh cake there wouldn 't be any ice there now .
Oh , I never thought of that .
Let 's have a look outside .
Look .
Someone must have stood here a long time .
Them are fresh footprints , ain 't they ?
Step up there a minute .
Look out for those tracks .
Now what ?
Look through the window .
Do you see Chalmers sitting there ?
Yeah .
The door 's open .
Supposing someone stood here and doctored Chalmers ' gin in the icebox on this side , and then stood here and watched him drink his last drink . through the window , what would you say ?
And then watched him die .
Then wrote the note and put the pencil in his hand , huh ?
Yeah .
Only that 's where he made his mistake .
Put the pencil in the wrong hand .
That 's just what I was thinking .
Gully ...
You know , if a car was parked here It would entirely conceal that door and that window .
Yeah .
Then Chalmers didn 't kill himself , huh ?
Let 's leave that to Sheehan .
If I 'm any good of a guesser , he ought to be here by now . We found him tumbled over the table .
Dead , huh ?
Don 't let Sheehan know what we found out .
I gotcha .
The captain got here 15 minutes ago .
Captain ?
What are you and that Keystone cop doing here ?
Now looky here , Sheehan , you can 't talk that way about me .
Remember I 'm chief of the studio police and I got rights .
I ...
I ...
Nature in the raw .
Here 's another opportunity for your skill , Lieutenant .
We 've been waiting for you ,
Everybody around here seems to know more about police matters than the police .
That 's noble of you to admit .
Did you two losers touch anything around here ?
Nothing important .
Good , then clear out .
And take that uniformed moron with you .
Come on .
Suicide , huh ?
Looks like it .
Well , I always thought it was Chalmers right from the start .
Now who 's the Keystone cop ?
You don 't even know Chalmers was left-handed .
Come on !
Left-handed ?
Sure .
That starts it all over again .
I can remember when murders were nice , clean , simple things done with machine guns and meat axes .
But this case !
Keep coming .
All right .
What seems to be the trouble ?
Battery 's dead .
But didn 't Miss Lane get a new battery just last week ?
Yeah , I don 't understand it .
It 's bone dry .
The liquid 's all gone .
Just as I thought
You were right .
Poison .
The electro ... electrolytic * * * 38 % ... distilled water 33 % , electrolytic liquid 11 % by volume the man said at least a spoonful would kill a man dead .
Electrolytic acid .
Did he say anything else ?
No , that was all .
Hey .
Ain 't them the same kind of tread that left the marks under Chalmers ' window ?
There 's probably a thousand cars in Hollywood that have that make of tire .
Yeah , I never thought of that .
Say , Gully .
I want you to get me the key to Brent 's dressing room .
But don 't anybody know it 's for me .
Say , I 'll get you the key to the city if you want it .
I have a couple of things to do .
I 'll meet you here in half an hour .
Okay .
Who is it ?
Frank , may I come in ?
Just a minute .
Why all the locks ?
I was just going through some old letters and didn 't want to be disturbed .
Oh , I see .
Where have you been ?
I 've been waiting all afternoon for you .
Oh , I 've just been doing a little sleuthing .
Marcia , you trust me , don 't you ?
Why , yes , of course .
You know I 'd do anything in the world for you , don 't you ?
I believe you would , dear .
Then ... is there anything you know about the murder of Brent that you haven 't told me ? No .
I 've just come from Chalmers ' place .
He 's dead .
Chalmers ?
Poisoned .
You mean murdered ?
If it isn 't that , it 's a good imitation on it .
Oh , how awful .
Whoever did it used electrolytic acid .
Acid out of a battery .
The unfortunate part of the whole thing is that ... they used your car and the acid out of your battery .
My car ?
That 's why my car wouldn 't start .
Yes .
I only told you this because I 'm afraid Sheehan will find out and arrest you on suspicion .
That would mean headlines and scandal .
What do you want me to do ?
I want you to get out of here .
Any place , just so Sheehan can 't find you .
But that 's running away .
Only for a day or two . Just to give me time .
I 'll go to Mary 's at Malibu .
She 'll help me .
That 's swell .
Make it fast , will you ?
There 's no knowing how close Sheehan is behind me .
I 'll telephone you when I have it all worked out .
You may have a long beard by then , but I 'll try and hurry .
Bye-bye , sweet .
Come in .
Leon .
I suppose you 're surprised that I 'm here , huh , Marcia ?
Frankly , yes .
You haven 't come to see me since ... since Brent 's accident .
I should think you 'd know why .
I don 't .
I only know that I ... that I want to help you .
I have all the help I need .
Marcia , you mustn 't treat me like this .
I never said anything to you while Brent was alive .
But you should know how I feel .
You 've succeeded in making your feelings quite plain enough .
Marcia , I ... I 'm very fond of you .
Not the kind of fondness I care about .
Please go now , Leon . I 'm in rather a hurry .
Marcia .
Maybe some day you will come to me and ask for help .
Maybe you will apologize to me for laughing about how I feel for you .
Perhaps Brent wasn 't killed for nothing .
No matter how smart they are they always slip up .
What 's your name ?
Pardon me .
Hello ?
Yes , sir , I will .
Oh , wait a minute . Here she is now .
Miss Lane .
Mr Steiner would like to see you in his office .
Thank you .
What 's your name ?
Mr Wheatcroft .
Mr Todd , please .
Mr Wheatcroft calling to see you .
All right , thank you .
Pull down that blind .
Did you see Brent when he came in ?
I see everybody .
What kind of a suit did he have on ?
There it is .
Funny Sheehan missed looking in here .
You 've been keeping him too busy .
See what those letters are .
Here 's one from a dame named Agnes .
Agnes who ?
She ain 't that dumb .
She don 't say much .
Except that uh ... she can 't live without him .
Married , too .
Says her husband don 't understand her .
Well , it 's that old , old story .
Two men and a woman .
The internal triangle .
What kind of place is the Cliffside Inn ?
You know , one of those weekend places with all the Mr Smiths , and Mr Jones , and Mr Browns .
Brent wouldn 't go there alone , would he ?
Not him .
How far is Ocean View from here ?
Couple of hours north on the Coast Road .
I guess that 's our next stop .
Why ?
I 'm beginning to think there 's a woman in the case .
No ...
Mr Drew , this case is becoming complicated .
Even for me .
Come on .
Gee , it 's 4 : 30 .
I gotta check in .
Listen . Don 't go away without me , will you ? All right , Gully .
I 'll pick you up at the gate on my way out .
Mr Drew , I 've been looking for you .
Miss Lane wants to see you .
She 's in Mr Steiner 's office .
Thanks .
Yes , sir .
Go right in , Mr Drew .
When did you find out your car wouldn 't start ?
About an hour ago .
Well , with all your dabbling you didn 't throw us off .
You 've thrown yourself off if you think Miss Lane had anything to do with Chalmers or Brent either .
All right , all right , just sit down there .
And keep quiet .
Where did you go this afternoon ?
I went downtown .
In your car ?
Yes .
Where did you park it ?
On the street .
In front of Ellsmith 's flower shop .
I ordered some flowers for Myles ...
Mr Brent 's funeral .
Then where did you go ?
You went to Chalmers ' house , didn 't you ?
Wait a minute , I won 't stand for this .
You can 't trick Miss Lane into answers .
And have little boy blue over there take them down .
Now keep quiet , Drew .
We 're trying to get to the bottom of this .
Oh , no , you 're not .
Sheehan is trying to force Miss Lane into admission of things she 's never done .
She might as well talk here as downtown .
I 've got a warrant for her .
For what ?
Suspicion of murder .
What 's your theory ?
It 's as simple as ABC .
It would be if you thought of it .
Chalmers killed Brent because he hated him and she offered him money .
Then she got frightened and killed Chalmers thinking that he would get drunk and give it away .
Every piece of evidence we 've got points to her .
It was her cigarette that blew the film , her car that made the tracks outside Chalmers ' house , and acid from her battery that killed him .
Oh , that 's a lot of bunk .
I know .
You 've got to make an arrest .
It 's okay with you .
Steiner , you can 't sit there and ... let them arrest Marcia .
She has nothing more to do with these murders than Lincoln had to do with the burning of Rome .
Mr Drew , we don 't know whether Lincoln burned Rome or not .
And we don 't care .
But this man is a policeman , so let us hear what he has to say .
We are not paying you to quarrel with the police .
I don 't care if you pay me a dime .
Sheehan , if you arrest Miss Lane now there 'll be a lot of nasty newspaper headlines .
Hold out for another 24 hours and I 'll be responsible .
Better than that , I 'll prove she 's innocent .
You 're making yourself ridiculous .
I 'm trying to protect one of your stars .
Wait a minute , Steiner .
Maybe he 's right .
What about this scandal ?
What about her box-office name ?
Haven 't we got enough trouble here already without having Marcia arrested ?
Mr Grossmith , if you want to accept the responsibility , you can .
But remember ...
This is a murder case .
Two people are dead .
And how do you know someone else won 't be killed ?
For my part , I believe that the police should not be interfered with .
Well , all I gotta say is that it 's ...
a terrible calamity .
Let 's go , Hillicker .
I guess the explosion 's over .
Someone in this studio killed Myles Brent and Chalmers .
And he 's trying to pin it on Marcia Lane .
But they won 't get away with it .
Come on , Miss Lane .
Marcia. honey .
I 'm sorry .
But I 'll get you out of this as soon as I can .
I know you will , Frank .
I 'm not worried , really .
Come on .
Special issue !
Read all about it ... here .
Hollywood mystery .
Marcia Lane accused of studio murder .
Extra !
Read all about it .
How do you do , sir ?
How do you do ?
I 'm from the publicity office at the Tonart Studio .
Yes ? I 'd like to see a list of the people who sent flowers to the Brent funeral .
Oh , I think I have a list . Thanks .
Terrible thing that Brent murder , wasn 't it ?
I hear they 're investigating Marcia Lane .
Yes , I guess she 'll be one who won 't send flowers .
Yes , she will .
She was here early this afternoon and ordered a big wreath .
Is that so ?
Here you are .
Mostly women .
It 's surprising many of them gave their names .
Oh , some of them didn 't .
There was a lady here just now who signed a check then thought better of it and threw it out .
Didn 't want the husband to see the cancelled check .
Perhaps .
Oh , pardon me .
Yes , madam ? Do you have any gardenias ?
Certainly .
Oh , good evening .
Alone ?
Yes , I 'm not stopping .
Oh .
I have a key here a friend of mine carried away with him .
Oh , thank you .
My name is Drew .
I 'm from the Tonart Studios .
I 'd like to keep this thing quiet .
Keep what quiet ?
Brent 's visit here the night before he was murdered .
You see , if the papers get hold of a story like this they 'll play it up and it 's bad for the picture business .
Well , it doesn 't do us any good either .
All right , let 's get together .
Sure , what do you want ?
Who was the woman with Brent ?
Mrs Brent .
There is no Mrs Brent .
They were divorced .
Well , then I don 't know who she is .
You see , I wasn 't here when they checked in and they left in such a hurry I didn 't see them go out .
In a hurry ?
Why ?
Well , a fellow came in here and started a row
Then he waited in that telephone booth over there and they came down and he stepped out .
At least that 's what Charly says .
Who 's Charly ?
One of the night bellhops .
Could I see him ? Sure .
Oh , Charly . Yes , sir .
This gentleman wants to ask you a few questions .
Shoot .
Do you remember seeing the man who waited for Myles Brent in the telephone booth the other night ?
I just got a glimpse of him before the fight .
What fight ?
When Brent hit him in the patio .
How did it happen ?
The lady ran out to the car when she saw the guy came out of the booth .
Then the guy steps up to Mr Brent and says :
Brent , I wanna see you .
I thought it sounded kinda silly because he was seeing him right there .
Then what happened ?
Brent takes the guy outside in the patio .
That 's when he socked him .
Then did Brent get into his car ?
Yeah .
And the other guy picked himself up .
Boy , was he mad .
And was his face red .
What did he say ?
What didn 't he say . Listen .
It was awful .
And then he beats it .
Would you remember this man if you saw him again ?
Well , I might .
And then again , I might not .
It all happened so fast .
Would you remember the lady ?
Sure .
Say , she was a honey .
She talked kind of funny .
Like she was a foreigner , or something .
With an accent ? Yeah .
That 's fine , Charly .
You 've been a great help to me .
Here .
Thanks .
Good night , and thanks .
Say , are you a detective ?
No , I 'm just from the studio .
Will there be detectives here ?
I hope not .
Call for Mr Wallace .
Calling Mr Wallace .
Which booth did that fellow hide in ?
There .
How long has it been out of order ?
Just since the guy hid in there .
I guess he kept pounding on the hook .
Shelf , shelf , that 's all you can think about , shelf .
Already this picture cost me $ 239.351 .
Better I put my money in the bank .
Can I get any interest from a shelf ?
I 'm not asking you to do anything .
But how can we finish the picture without print ?
I told you 17 times that we can use a double .
And play the whole kissing scene in a longshot ?
Why not ?
Because it 's all wrong .
It 's terrible .
I 've got my reputation to think of .
And I 've got my money to think of . Money , money .
What 's money ?
Now , just a minute .
Let 's take it calmly .
The New York office is of the opinion that the murder of Brent won 't hurt the picture .
So why not shoot that scene with a double and wind it up ?
It 's the last scene in the picture .
It can 't possibly do you any harm .
Exactly , Steiner 's quite right .
Oh , all right .
What 's the use of arguing with him ?
Good .
We can get the company together and shoot it tonight .
Wait a minute .
What about Marcia ?
Oh , we can arrange with Sheehan to use her for that one scene .
She can come over with the whole police department if he likes .
Everybody is on call , everything on the set is standing .
They can shoot it in half an hour .
Todd .
Oh , hold on a minute .
What time ?
Seven thirty ... say nine thirty .
Make it nine o 'clock .
We 'll save a half hour .
Todd , we are going to shoot the last scene of The Death Kiss tonight .
Round up the company for a nine o 'clock call .
Sure , Mr Steiner .
Max , we 're retaking The Death Kiss .
Get busy on the call .
Okay .
You have Brent 's double on call , haven 't you ?
Yes , I 'll have him all right .
But , say , what about Miss Lane ?
I 'll take care of her .
Hey , Mac , put that light over on the roof .
Screen 80 , Joe .
Good evening .
You know Mrs Avery ?
Yes , of course .
How are you ?
How do you do ?
I 'm surprised you 've come to see the retake .
Put it down to morbid curiosity .
That 's the woman of it .
She insisted on coming .
Well , come along with me .
I 'll have Howell make you comfortable .
He 's very good with the ladies .
Put that light high .
Put it up .
We 'll do it the same way .
You two girls in the back .
On the left .
Watch out .
Gulliver .
Yes , Miss Lane .
Do you know where Mr Drew is ?
He went away and left me after he promised he wouldn 't .
Do you know where he went ?
I got an idea , but I can 't tell .
Do you know when he 'll be back ?
I don 't know .
He 'll turn up .
You can 't lose that guy .
We 're ready for rehearsal , Miss Lane .
All right , thank you .
Go ahead .
We 'll wait here . Thank you .
And just as you reach here , Miss Lane steps up and kisses you .
And much to your surprise , because you don 't know her .
Then you turn , read your line to the doorman and walk out to the kerb .
Right .
Alas , I 'm so sorry about it .
I know it 's going to be difficult for you , but I 'll try and help you all I can .
Thank you , Tom .
Oh , do you know Mr Johnson ?
Yes , how do you do ?
Shall we try it once ?
Oh , George , let 's have quiet , please .
Quiet .
Rehearsal .
Take your places , please .
Hit them on .
Everyone ready for rehearsal ? Okay .
Camera .
This business gives me a funny feeling .
What do you mean ?
I don 't know .
Just gives me a funny feeling , that 's all .
Supposing it should happen somebody else gets shot ?
That 's ridiculous .
Well , maybe it is , maybe it ain 't .
Anyway , I don 't like the set and I don 't like the title of the picture .
The Death Kiss , ugh .
From now on we have no more titles with death in it .
Getting superstitious ?
Say , you ain 't got no nerves .
I ain 't afraid either .
I 'm just a little scared , that 's all .
What can possibly happen ?
That 's it .
Anything .
I must have been overlooking something .
A bloody shame , sir .
Most annoying .
Right under me very nose .
Wait a minute . What 's the matter now ?
I can 't get it with the mike there .
Well , go ahead and fix it the way you want it .
Swing it in here farther .
Come on , farther .
Now down a little closer . There .
Is that in your picture ?
No , it 's in place there . Okay .
Test it .
One , two , three , four .
One , two , three , four .
Microphone number two .
All right , let 's go . Okay for sound .
Oh , Lieutenant .
Can I see you a minute ?
Well , if it isn 't our little mystery writer .
I knew you 'd turn up .
Have you solved it ?
Come over here a minute .
What 's the revelation ?
I went through the clothes that Brent wore the night he was murdered .
I found a room key to the Cliffside Inn in his pocket .
I went up to the Inn and found that he 'd registered there the night before as Mr and Mrs Brent .
Not unusual for him , was it ?
No , but the husband of the woman that was with him waited for Brent in the telephone booth in the lobby .
When Brent came down they had a fight .
Brent beat him up and left with the woman .
Now there 's your motive .
The fellow who hid in the telephone booth is the fellow who murdered Brent .
It 's a motive , sure .
But it seems to me that everyone around here had a motive .
Yes , but the same man knew a lot about electricity and a lot about film .
Now , Chalmers couldn 't have thrown that cigarette butt in the film because he was nowhere around at the time .
Marcia couldn 't have poured acid on the negative .
She knows less about film than you do .
But the same fellow , whoever it was , found out that Chalmers had discovered his contraption in the lamp .
Stole Marcia 's car , took acid again , doctored Chalmers ' gin , and then returned the car .
But why did he take Miss Lane 's car ?
To give himself a double headed out .
If you believed that suicide gag , it would be the end of it .
If you didn 't , everything pointed to Marcia .
Whatever happened , he wouldn 't be suspected .
Yeah .
But you have got to show me that the guy who is at the end is someone here at the studio .
And that he had access to the light , the film , the car and everything else .
That 's easy .
The man who hid in the telephone booth left his trademark .
What 's this ?
Well , you know as well as I do .
Scribblings a man makes on a piece of paper are as identifying as a signature .
Oh , now all we 've got to do is to find the guy that scribbled like this , huh ?
I 've done that too .
Take a look at this .
Where did you get this ?
In Grossmith 's office .
Now , Avery , Steiner , Grossmith and Howell were in there having a conference .
And you think one of those four killed Brent ? Yes ? This is interesting .
But I 've only your word for it and that don 't count for much . Well , I 'll keep your paper dolls .
But you 've got to get me more substantial evidence than this before I can let Miss Lane go .
Take good care of these guns , boys , and don 't forget to check them back to me . Thank you .
Sure the gun isn 't loaded ?
You bet not .
I just looked .
Mind if I look ?
Not at all .
Is that clear to you ?
All right , we 'll take it .
Is everybody ready ?
Let 's make it .
Johnson , powder up , will you , please ?
Sure .
Thanks .
You 're welcome .
Frank .
I 've been so worried about you .
Darling , I 'm hot on the trail .
I 've got an idea .
If I 'm right , I 'll have this whole thing wrapped up and tied before you know it .
But don 't go away before I 'm through , will you ?
You bet I won 't .
Miss Lane , will you stand in a minute , please ?
See you later .
It isn 't loaded , is it ?
What do you think , I 'm crazy ?
Mind if I look ? No , go ahead .
Thanks .
Say , Bill , those aren 't the same guns you used before , are they ?
I know .
I couldn 't get 38s before so I slipped in the 45s .
Nobody knew the difference .
You mean 38s were called for before ?
Yeah , we made a row about it .
Who insisted ?
Okay , coming up !
Come on with me .
Listen .
I 've got it .
This is Bill , the property man .
He tells me on the day that Brent was murdered he was definitely ordered to give all the extras 38 caliber guns .
Yeah ?
Did you get it ?
38 caliber guns were ordered .
Now , if Bill had supplied them , we would never have known that it wasn 't an accident .
But he didn 't .
He had to use 45s .
That 's how he knew it was a murder .
Now , the fellow who ordered those 38s ...
Say , who ordered those guns ?
Go ahead , Bill , tell him .
Well , it was Mr ...
Turn those lights on !
Lights . Give me a light .
Here you are , Sheehan .
There he is .
There he goes . Up there .
Come on , he went this way .
No , there he is . Come on .
There he goes .
Stand where you are or I 'll shoot .
Avery .
Mr Avery !
He 's the that who ordered the guns .
Yeah , and like a fool I told you about him under the microphone .
He was listening in with the earphones .
So it was him .
Don 't look at him now .
He 's dead .
He 's dead .
Yes , I am glad .
The woman at the Cliffside Inn , huh ?
You stay here , Hillicker , Come on . Come with me .
I got him .
I got him .
There 's your man .
Who is he ?
You 'll suffer for this .
You despicable cad .
So , you 're a policeman , eh ?
Pardon me .
I think I owe apologies , Miss Lane .
And to you too .
I 'm sorry I was unpleasant .
You know , at first I could have sworn it was you .
I knew it and it made me quite angry .
But you 're much more clever than I gave you credit for .
Well , that sounds like a new contract .
We 'll talk about that later .
Oh , Lieutenant ...
Would you mind telling me why it is that detectives always wear their hats even in the presence of ladies ?
Sure .
That 's so we won 't have anything in our hands or arms in case we have to use them .
That 's one for the book .
Do you mind if I write it in right now ?
ISLAND OF LOST SOULS
Mr. Hogan !
Mr. Hogan !
Derelict afloat with a man on board !
- Whereabouts ?
- Off your port bow !
Right !
- Get ahold of him , boys !
- We got him .
- Wanna salvage that boat ? - No .
Take him to my cabin .
Ruth !
Ruth !
- Ruth !
- Easy , old man .
Easy , easy , easy .
What ship is this ?
" Covena " , trading ship .
We picked you up adrift .
Oh , yeah .
I remember .
- Where 's she bound ?
- Apia .
Apia ?
I 'm in luck .
Luck ?
Yeah .
That 's where - - Where I was bound when my ship went down .
- Yeah .
The Lady Vain , wasn 't it ?
- Yeah .
We picked up her S.O.S.
You - - you got a wireless aboard ?
Yeah .
- You send a message for me ?
- Sure , sure .
You better make it short .
You got a lot of resting to do .
Thanks .
I suppose it 's to Ruth ?
- How 'd you know her name ?
- Heard nothing else for the last two hours .
She 's my fiance .
We 're going to be married in Apia .
- Miss Ruth , uh - - - Thomas .
Continental Hotel .
What 's the message ?
Tell her I was picked up by this boat ...
And when we expect to arrive .
Also , that I 'm all right , thanks to you , doctor .
You are a doctor , aren 't ya ?
Yes .
At least , I was ...
Once upon a time .
- What 's up , old chap ?
- Bulletin on the wreck , Lady Vain .
Oh . Oh , yes .
Good afternoon , miss van de Camp .
Miss Thomas ?
- Miss Thomas ?
- Oh , right here .
- For me ?
- Radiogram .
Thank you .
- How do you feel ?
- How do I look ?
- Better .
- That 's the way I feel .
- A little turn around the deck will do you good . - Not a bad idea .
You know , I thought I heard those things .
Say , what is this , A floating zoo ?
Well , yes , in a way .
Good morning , captain .
- I want to thank you for - -
- Who 're you ?
Mr. Parker , captain Davies .
- Parker .
Parker ?
- We picked him up day before yesterday .
Why wasn 't I told ?
- We tried to wake you .
- why didn 't ya ?
You had a slight list to port .
- What do you mean ?
- You were drunk .
Drunk , was I ?
- Why wouldn 't I be , with a cargo like I got ?
- Cargo is cargo .
I know , but this boatload of filthy animals ?
All the way from Mombassa to where ?
To some island .
Which island ?
You answer me that , mr .
Montgomery .
You 're well-paid for it .
An island without a name .
An island not on the chart .
You think I don 't know whose island that is , don 't ya ?
- Well , I do , mr . " sawbones " Montgomery .
- Easy , captain .
Well , it 's Dr. Moreau 's island .
Dr. Moreau 's island , and it stinks all over the whole South seas .
That 's superstitious South sea gossip .
Dr. Moreau is a brilliant man and a great scientist .
Well , if you ask me , He 's a black-handed , grave-robbin ' ghoul . That 's what he is .
Aw , what 's the use .
You 're drunk .
Ha !
Yeah !
Hey , what 'd you say ?
- Nothing .
- That 's all right then .
What do ya got there ?
- Slop for dog . - Slop ?
Ain 't there slop on this deck already ?
M 'ling , get out .
Yeah , before I - - Why - -
I 'm drunk , am I ?
Only a drunken man would do a thing like that .
That means trouble .
There now .
You 're all right .
M 'ling !
Go forward and stay forward .
Say , who is that fella ?
My servant , that 's all .
Now look here , Parker .
You better get outta sight and stay out .
There 'll be plenty of trouble when he comes to .
Get him off there !
Overboard with the whole spittin ' mess of ' em .
- Hey , is that Moreau over there ?
- Yeah .
Say , what is all this mystery about Moreau and his island ?
I don 't know , but if I did know , maybe I 'd want to forget .
Hogan !
Mr. Hogan !
Are we all free and clear ?
All clear , sir !
- All right , cast off !
- Cast off !
All right , cast off !
All right , dr . Moreau , That 's the last of ' em !
And this is the last time I 'l ever pull in here ...
Forevermore !
Amen !
I hear you 're gettin ' off here .
No .
I 'm gettin ' off at Apia .
You 're gettin ' off here .
Cast off .
Now hurry it up .
Now , what 's happened ?
All right , old boy .
Fell overboard .
On deck .
On deck !
Hey , you lost your man !
Well , finders keepers !
Full speed ahead , Hogan !
What 's that fool talking about ?
Haul up that ladder !
I 've got to get to Apia !
- You can swim , can 't ya ?
- Take this man with you !
There 's marine law !
This man 's shipwrecked and you 've got to pick him up !
I picked him up and dropped him in my first port of call .
I can 't have this man aboard !
Well , throw him overboard .
That 's what I did .
Davies !
Drop that ladder !
- This is most unfortunate . - I simply must get to Apia .
We sight a ship maybe once in a twelfth-month .
- Uh , mr .
Parker , dr . Moreau .
- How do you do ?
Mr. Parker , you may take Montgomery and the schooner ...
And leave for Apia in the morning . That 's very nice .
Thank you .
Not at all .
I 'm happy to be of service .
Montgomery is a fair sort of sailor , And I can give you enough of a crew .
Ouran !
Gola !
Get away from those cages !
Come on now .
Let 's unload this stuff .
The dogs first , then the monkeys , then the cages .
Hurry it up !
I 'll stay with Parker tonight on the schooner .
No .
I 'm taking him to the house .
Mr. Parker .
- You can 't do that .
- I 've got something in mind .
- Would you come with me , please ?
- Surely .
- You understand you are an uninvited guest .
- Certainly .
You may find our domain rather strange .
I shall have to rely upon your caution while you 're here ...
- ... and you 're silence when you 're gone .
- Of course , doctor .
Limestone formation .
Curious , isn 't it ?
This was once the crater of a volcano .
Extraordinarily fertile , this volcanic dust .
Seeds blown hereby the wind and brought by birds .
See the result .
Don 't be alarmed , Mr. Parker .
You 're quite expert with that whip , aren 't you , doctor ?
It 's a hobby .
I learned to handle one as a boy in Australia .
There 's my house .
Strange-looking natives you have here .
You 'll be wanting a cold shower , I take it , before dinner .
An excellent brandy , Montgomery .
I hope you brought plenty .
Then , of course , you did .
Montgomery is a man to trust , Mr. Parker ,
Especially in the selection in the ordering of your liquors .
M 'ling , you may take everything .
Yes .
You are a man of discretion , Mr. Parker .
I hope so .
Now , if you 'll excuse us .
- M 'ling , brandy for mr .
Parker .
- Nothing more , thank you .
That 'll be all , M 'ling .
You may go .
I should much prefer that you don 't leave this room .
Your wish , doctor .
I had my reasons for keeping you sober .
- Go to the laboratory .
See what 's to be done .
- You 're not going ?
I 'm taking her to Parker .
- Lota to Parker ?
- Why do I brought him to the house ?
He 's seen too much already .
She 's never seen anything like him .
The only reactions we get from her are fear and terror .
- That 's understandable .
- But how will she respond to Parker ...
Where there 's no cause for fear ?
Will she be attracted ?
Is she capable of being attracted ?
Has she a woman 's emotional impulses ?
I 'd scarcely hoped for a chance like this short of London .
Lota .
Lota .
Come here .
Lota , I 'e taught you many things .
Yes .
- All that you know , I 've taught you . - Yes .
I 'm going to let you learn something for yourself .
A man has come from the sea .
I will take you to him .
Let you talk with him .
Yes ?
I 'm going to leave you alone with him .
You may talk with him about anything , About the world he comes from .
But you must say nothing about me , nothing about the Law , Nothing about the House of Pain .
- You understand me ?
- Yes .
Then come along with me .
Get out !
Get out , I said !
It 's all right .
Go in , Lota .
- This is mr .
Parker , Lota .
- How do you do ?
- Don 't be afraid .
- How ... do you do ?
Mr. Parker has come to us from over the sea .
She 's a pure Polynesian .
The only woman on the entire island .
Well , uh , I 'l leave you two young people together .
I 've got work to do .
Won 't you sit down ?
Cigarette ?
No .
- I thank you .
- You 're welcome .
You 'll have to pardon me because ...
This is all very strange to me .
What island are you from ?
Tahiti ?
Samoa ?
I mean , where is your home ?
Home ?
This my home .
I know , but you 're not a native of this island .
I know because I 've seen some of them .
How does it happen that you 're the only woman on this island ?
Did dr . Moreau Bring you here ?
Pardon me if I seem to be too inquisitive .
Moreau .
Quickly , please .
You come from the sea ?
Well , rather .
Three days on an upturned lifeboat .
You go away ?
Tomorrow morning .
I wish you would not go away .
Well , that 's very nice of you .
But ... I must .
You come back again ?
Well , I don 't know .
What 's that ?
It 's the house , the House of Pain .
No , no !
It 's nothing !
It 's nothing !
Nothing ?
Somebody 's being tortured !
Get out !
Get out !
They 're vivisecting a human being .
They 're cutting a living man to pieces .
Now I know about his natives .
They 're his victims .
You and I may be next .
Come on .
Let 's get out of here .
Other gate .
We 'll take Moreau 's boat and get away from here tonight . Now .
Sea !
Sea !
Sea !
Sea !
Man from sea !
Man from sea !
Lota !
Stop !
Stop !
What ?
What ?
Man from sea , They are like us !
They are like him ?
One is not man .
- What is the Law ?
- Not to run on all fours .
That is the Law .
- Are we not men ?
- Are we not men ?
- What is the law ?
- Not to eat meat .
That is the Law .
Are we not men ?
Are we not men ?
What is the Law ?
Not to spill blood .
That is the Law .
Are we not men ?
Are we not men ?
His is the hand That makes !
His is the Hand that makes !
His is the hand That heals .
His is the Hand that heals !
His is the House ...
Of Pain !
His is the House ...
Of Pain !
I didn 't think you 'd be idiotic enough to leave the house .
Now I can understand why you and your island ... stink from one end of the south seas to the other .
What makes your natives such monstrosities ?
I saw you vivisecting a man .
My dear young fool , you 're entirely mistaken .
You can 't get away with it in my case .
Take it .
I 'm now unarmed and you 're fully protected .
It 's quite evident that I mean you no harm .
Well , would you be good enough to come to the house ?
Lota .
Lota , go to your room !
I started with plant life in London 20 years ago .
I took an orchid and upon it I performed a miracle .
I stripped 100,000 years of slow evolution from it , And I had no longer an orchid ... But what orchids will be 100,000 years from now .
That 's one there .
Yes , but how , doctor ?
By a slight change in the single unit of a germ plasm .
That 's a common lily .
That 's a chrysanthemum .
That 's unfortunately what happened to some asparagus .
I went on with this research just as it led me .
I let my imagination run fantastically ahead .
Why not experiment with the more complex organisms ?
Man is the present climax of a long process of organic revolution .
All animal life is tending toward the human form .
I was still in London when I began this phase of my experiments .
One day a dog escaped from my laboratory , Went shrieking into the streets , and I left London .
The newspapers at my heels aroused England , crying for my blood .
I picked up Montgomery and brought him along .
He was a medical student ... Facing a prison term for a professional indiscretion .
That was 11 long years ago , 11 long years I 've worked .
Plastic surgery , Blood transfusions ,
Gland extracts with ray baths .
With what I have discovered in my own work among the cellular organisms .
My work , my discoveries , mine alone .
With these I have wiped out ...
Hundreds of thousands of years of evolution .
From the lower animals I have made with - -
Go see for yourself , Mr. Parker .
- You 're convinced that this thing isn 't human .
- Its cries are human .
- You know what it is that I began with ?
- No .
- An animal .
- An animal ?
Like those in the cages outside ?
Then those , creatures out in the jungle ?
Are my creations .
- They were made from animals ?
- Yes .
This thing , this poor , tortured creature - -
What does that matter ?
- Of all things vile !
- Mr. Parker , spare me these youthful horrors , please .
And those ... those poor things out in the jungle , those animals , they , they talk .
That was my first great achievement :
Articulate speech controlled by the brain .
That was an achievement .
Oh , it takes a long time and infinite patience ... to make them talk .
Someday I will create a woman and it will be easier .
Those are some of my less successful experiments .
They supply the power to create others ... more successful .
With each experiment , I improve upon the last .
I get nearer and nearer .
Mr. Parker , do you know what it means to feel like god ?
I 'm talking too much , aren 't I ?
- Good night , Mr. Parker .
- Good night .
- You know the way to your room ? - Yes , thanks .
I hope you sleep well .
Thanks .
Good night .
Did you see that ?
She was tender like a woman .
How that little scene spurs the scientific imagination onward .
I wonder how much of Lota 's animal origin is still alive .
How nearly a perfect woman she is .
It 's possible I may find out ...
With the aid of mr .
Parker . We won 't have much time if he leaves for Apia in the morning .
Wouldn 't it be a great loss to science ... If he left for Apia in the morning ?
I want to thank you , Doctor , for the - -
- Happy to have been of service to you .
- I appreciate what you 're - -
Whoa !
Whoa , this is most distressing .
I , I don 't know what to say . I can 't account for it .
Unless the natives , they were a bit out of hand last night .
You said it , mate .
- Hello , darlin ' .
How you been ?
- Hello , baby .
Did you miss me ?
- Did I miss ya ?
- Pardon me .
Excuse me .
Didn 't you have a mr .
Parker on board ? - Parker ?
- Yes .
Oh . You better talk to the skipper .
Now , men , stay sober .
Any drinking to be done , I 'll do it myself .
If you get in a fight , send for me . - Hello there , baby .
- Captain , captain .
Didn 't you have a mr .
Parker On board ? - Parker ?
- Yes .
No .
But won 't I do ?
Didn 't you rescue him from the Lady Vain ?
He sent me a wireless from your ship .
Oh , yes .
He got off at my first port of call .
- But what port ? - That 's my business .
Maybe the American consul will make it his business .
Well , give the consul my regards .
You knew this man wanted to come to Apia , didn 't you ?
I rescued him at sea ... And dropped him off at my first port of call .
What port ?
- It was an island , sir .
- What island ?
Latitude 15 degrees south ... And longitude 170 west .
1-5 south , 1-7-0 west .
Very small , sir .
You won 't find it on the charts .
Then it isn 't a port .
Well , it 's an island , sir .
I dropped some cargo there .
Oh , I see .
That 'll be all for the present .
Yes , sir .
If I find any irregularities , I 'll have your license revoked .
- Yes , sir .
- Wouldn 't like that , would you ?
- No , sir .
- I didn 't think you would .
Yes , sir .
- Yes , sir .
- Good morning , captain .
- Miss Thomas , this is captain Donahue .
- How do you do ?
- When will you be ready to sail ?
- I 'm ready now , sir .
You 'll find Donahue 's boat Perfectly safe ,
- But not very comfortable .
- I 've worked her all over .
- Are you clear on the position ?
- Yes . 15 south and 170 west .
- Okay .
Well , good luck .
- Thank you .
- Thank you so much . - Not at all .
Glad to be of service .
Lota .
You startled me .
You 're a strange child .
Talk to me .
Not now .
Talk to me .
- Lota , do you know what this is ?
- Book .
Yes , book .
From Dr. Moreau 's library .
About electricity , wireless telegraphy , radio .
How to build a shortwave transmitter .
Course you haven 't the faintest idea ... What I 'm talking about , have you ?
Talk to me more .
All right .
I 'l tell you something you will understand .
Lota , I must get away from this island .
Book ... take you away .
Maybe book take me away .
Lota !
Why did you do that ?
Book take you away .
Lota ... I 'm in love with someone else .
I should have told you .
Love ?
Ohh ...
Lota .
- Moreau , you don 't deserve to live .
- I beg your pardon .
Those creatures in the jungle were horrible enough , But to have created that girl ... - Lota ?
- Yes , Lota. oh , it 's criminal .
You 're an amazingly unscientific young man .
I could have overlooked those others .
I could have shown you that much consideration .
But now I 'l expose you to the world ...
- for what you really are , Moreau . - When are you leaving ?
I think you 'd better sit down and make yourself comfortable .
- Would you care for a cup of tea ?
- No , thank you .
We may as well discuss this frankly , now that you know the facts .
Lota is my most nearly perfect creation .
I was thinking of taking her with me as exhibit " a " ... on a triumphal return to London .
I wanted to prove how completely ... she was a woman , Whether she was capable of loving , mating ... and having children .
She was afraid of Montgomery and myself .
Then you came .
Well , she was very much attracted to you .
You can see , of course , the possibilities ... That presented themselves .
I 'l tell you this , Moreau :
You 'll make arrangements for me to leave this island ... As quickly as possible , Or this great scientific work you 've been doing will stop .
How did he find out ?
What did you say to him ?
What did you do to let him know ?
What is it , Moreau ?
The stubborn beast flesh creeping back .
It 's no use , Montgomery .
I may as well quit .
Day by day , it creeps back .
It creeps back .
You see this ?
The first of them all to shed tears .
She is human .
I 'm not beaten .
- Get everything ready !
- For what ?
- This time I 'l burn out all the animal in her ! - No !
Aah !
- I 'l make her completely human !
- No !
No , no !
No !
No !
- I 'l keep Parker here .
He 's already attracted .
- No !
Time and monotony will do the rest .
Gola !
Gola !
- Huh ?
- Boat come !
Man !
One not man !
- One not man ?
- One like Lota !
Hello in there .
I guess it 's all right .
- You afraid ?
- No , of course not .
All right . I just asked out of politeness .
Look !
See some funny sights in these islands .
That jungle don 't look any too inviting .
We must go on .
We 've got to find him .
All right .
But I 'd just as soon leave it for somebody else ... If there was anybody else here to do it .
There 's a bird in these jungles , kind of a parrot .
Laughs like a man .
They call him a laughing jackass .
Funny name for a bird .
When you figure out he laughs like a man , That 's not such a funny name after all .
You 're taking a very long time , Montgomery .
There 's a short circuit here somewhere .
M 'ling !
- M 'ling !
They come on boats !
- Who ?
- Peoples .
- People ?
Two .
One like Lota .
Dr. Moreau !
Dr. Moreau !
Doctor !
- Dr. Moreau !
Boat come !
People !
- People ?
- Man and one like Lota .
- What ?
Parker sent a wireless to Apia from Davies ' ship .
Hello there .
Ohh !
Ouran .
We 're looking for a man named Parker .
Edward Parker .
- Oh . Won 't you come in ?
- Yeah .
Thanks .
I 'm dr . Moreau .
This is my house .
You 're very welcome .
Thank you , doctor .
I 'm Ruth Thomas ,
- And this is captain Donahue .
- How are you , doc ?
- How do you do ?
Go right in .
- Nice place you got here .
Serves its purpose .
Ruth !
Oh .
Ouran .
All right
I may not need Parker .
Captain Donahue was good enough to bring me here .
- How do you do , captain ?
- Fine , thanks .
How are you ?
So you found him ?
I 'd imagined Edward in some terrible place ,
- ... but this is charming .
- I 'll get my things and we 'll be on our way .
It 's getting late .
You 'll pardon me , doctor .
Not at all .
Won 't you come in and wait ?
Thank you .
What kind of a place did you say this was ?
- I didn 't say .
- Oh .
It 's an experimental station of a sort ... For bioanthropological research .
Oh . I see .
Lota ?
House of Pain ?
No .
No House of Pain .
I promise that .
There 's no twilight in the tropics .
Night falls like a curtain .
Thank you , M 'ling .
- Care for a highball , Miss Thomas ?
- No , thank you .
- Captain Donahue , I suppose - -
- I 'll take mine straight .
I thought so .
Whoa . That 'll do .
Thanks .
- Mr. Parker ?
- No , thanks .
We 'll be going now .
Aren 't you being a little rash ?
- Rash ?
- Come on , Donahue .
You have a mile to go through my jungle .
- Yes , I realize that .
- We 're not afraid .
I can see , captain Donahue , you would be afraid of nothing .
But mr .
Parker had one experience at night in my jungle .
I have no wish to frighten you , Miss Thomas ...
But if mr . Parker puts you in what he knows to be real danger , that will be his responsibility .
Couldn 't you send someone - -
If you 'd care to accept the hospitality of my house , You can leave in complete safety in the morning .
Perhaps that would be better .
Captain Donahue , you can share mr .
Parker 's room .
Miss Thomas , you can have my room .
M 'ling , dinner Will be for five .
No wine , Montgomery ?
No .
Extraordinary .
- My regards , Captain Donahue . - Here 's mud in your eye , doc .
Doc , I see you 're a vegetarian .
It 's on account of the natives .
- They 've never tasted meat .
- No " long pig " ?
" Long pig " ?
- He means human flesh , miss Thomas .
- Oh .
What 's that ?
The natives .
They have a curious ceremony .
- Mr. Parker has witnessed it .
- Tell us about it , Edward .
Oh , it 's - - it 's nothing .
They are restless tonight .
Oh !
Ohh .
What is it , dear ?
Oh , nothing .
Uh ...
Don 't pay any attention to me .
- A little more claret , Captain Donahue ?
- Don 't mind if I do .
M 'ling , fill up Captain Donahue 's glass .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
That 'll do .
- Well ?
- Skoal .
- Good night , doc .
That 's sure swell wine .
- Thank you .
- Good night , dr . Moreau .
- Good night , miss Thomas .
- Good night .
- Good night .
Whoa !
It 's a good thing I ain 't a drinkin ' man .
- You did very well for yourself tonight . - You oughta see me when I 'm - -
Yes , I have a rough idea .
I remember one night down in Mombassa - -
- Captain ... that 's our room over there .
- Oh , sure .
- Good night , miss Thomas . - Good night .
Don 't be frightened , dear .
- I 'll be just across the hall .
- Oh , I 'm all right .
What 's there to be afraid of ?
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Better lock your door .
- Now , don 't you worry .
I 'lll be all right .
- If you need me , call . - Good night .
Aah !
Aah !
Ruth !
Ruth , what is it ?
Quick !
You 'd better get dressed , dear .
Ouran tried to break into her room .
Miss Thomas ' room .
- I suppose you know that .
- I heard a scream and some shots .
That 's all you know , is it ?
You didn 't want it to happen , of course .
That isn 't what you meant by not need Parker .
Will you mind your own business ?
I know you too well and too long , Moreau .
I 'd have stood for anything .
I have stood for plenty .
But not this .
You 're insane to even think of it , And I 'm through with you here and now .
Are you going back to England ... to prison ?
I 'd prefer it .
Same one that peeked out through the bushes this afternoon ?
Yes .
It was horrible .
We 're no safer here than in the jungle .
I 'd advise the jungle .
I 'm sure miss Thomas will be safer there .
- I 'll go get my crew .
We 'll stop this .
- Come with me a minute .
- I don 't like your taking this risk .
- Here .
You may need this .
- No , no .
I 'm already heeled .
- I 'll take that lantern .
It might come in handy .
- Here .
- Here 's a key to the front gate .
- Well , here goes nothin ' .
Ouran .
Ouran , I want you to follow him ...
And put your hands around his throat .
- The Law .
- It 's all right tonight .
Get back there !
Get back !
Thanks , Montgomery .
- You must have a reason for helping us .
- I have .
I 'm going with you .
Get back !
Get back !
Aah !
Aah !

We 'll try the back way .
Quick , they 're coming !

- Lota .
We can 't leave her . Wait here .
Have you forgotten the House of Pain ?
No .
You made us in the House of Pain .
Pain !
House of Pain !
You made us ...
Things !
- Not men !

What was that ?
Where 's Lota ?
You ... Go back ... To sea .
She 's done for .
- Come on .
- We 'll take her to the sea .
It 's better that we leave her here .
The fire will soon destroy all of Moreau 's work .
Ah !

End
This film was shot in 1932 soon after the founding of the Spanish Republic .
The region we are going to visit is called Las Hurdes . It 's barren and inhospitable and man is forced to fight for subsistence .
The first road to las Hurdes was built only in 1922 . Before that , it was unknown to the rest of the world and even in Spain .
On the way to Las Hurdes , we pass La Alberca . It 's a bit more prosperous , but still feudal . Almost all the inhabitants of Las Hurdes are in debt to this town .
The church at La Alberca .
Two skulls in their niches symbolise the town 's destiny .
Most homes have three storeys .
This is rare in Spain and gives the streets a medieval aspect .
Many homes have a religious text over the door :
" Ave Maria , conceived without sin . "
The day we arrived , the women were dressed in their finery .
Why were they dressed so beautifully ?
They said they were going to the plaza for an annual ceremony that 's strange and barbaric .
Newly wedded men gather . Each must take up the head of a rooster .
A rope extends across the street . On it hangs a rooster tied by the legs .
The men gallop by and try to catch a head .
After parading in triumph with the heads the grooms offer everyone wine .
It 's a time for enjoyment .
In the crowd , a baby adorned with silver medals .
They are like amulets from Africa or Oceania .
By 7 pm almost everyone is drunk .
3 kilometers away , from a hill top we look down on the 52 villages of Las Hurdes . They have a total population of ten thousand .
Down steep slopes to the valley of the Batuecas inhabited by a solitary monk and his maid .
For centuries this has been home to monks of the Carmelite order . They preached Christianity in the villages of Las Hurdes .
Batuecas has a rich prehistory .
Skilful cave paintings representing men , goats and bees .
Toads , snakes and lizards are now the only inhabitants of these ruins .
Rich vegetation with more than 200 species of trees .
Yet 5 kilometres from this fertile valley there are almost no trees .
Just a few fruit trees , rockroses and heather .
The convent is surrounded by an 8 kilometer wall .
It protects from attacks by wolves and wild boar .
Inside are the scattered ruins of 18 hermitages .
Each is marked by a cypress or two .
Beyond here ... .. lies Las Hurdes proper .
We are entering the barren lands of Las Hurdes .
The village of Aceitunilla is in one of the poorest valleys .
The white building is the school , built recently .
On its sloping streets we encounter daily life .
Strange , but we never heard anyone singing in Las Hurdes .
A miserable rivulet runs through the village down from the hills .
In summer , water in scarce .
The villagers are obliged to use this filthy water .
Strange things go on here .
The rivulet serves many purposes .
Three children eat a slice of bread dipped in water .
Until recently bread was almost unheard of here .
It was given them by their teacher who makes the children eat in his presence fearing their parents will take it from them if they take it home .
The children are summoned to school .
These ragged , barefoot urchins receive the same education as children the world over .
Clothing is brought back by Hurdanos who leave each summer for Castilla and Andalusia .
They go there mainly to beg .
When they return , they exchange clothing for potatoes .
These hungry children are learning algebra .
In some villages of Las Hurdes most of the children are orphans .
They are abandoned children whom the women of Las Hurdes bring back from Public Assistance in Cuidad Rodrigo a two-day walk away across the hills .
The women raise the children in exchange for 15 pesetas a month .
This miserable sum is enough for an entire family ... .. until the not-so-distant day when the practice is outlawed .
An unexpected and shocking picture we saw in the school .
Who could have made this absurd engraving ?
We opened at random a book of maxims we found on a table .
One of the best students writes on a slate one of the book 's maxims .
It 's the same the world over : " Respect other people 's property ! "
In this relatively fertile valley there are some walnut , cherry and olive trees .
This is the village of Martilandran .
The shapes between the trees , resembling the shell of some mythical animal are just the roof tiles of the village .
Entering the village , we are greeted by a chorus of coughing .
Most of the villagers are ill .
It 's a scene of devastating misery .
The principle disease here is goitre .
Look at this woman with her goitre :
She 's only 32 years old .
We visit the village in the company of the mayor .
On an empty street we see a girl .
We ask the mayor what 's wrong with her .
He tells us the girl 's been there 3 days without moving .
She must be sick .
One of us goes up to her to find out what 's wrong with her throat .
He asks her to open her mouth .
Her gums and throat are inflamed .
Sadly there 's nothing we can do for her .
Two days later we returned to the village .
We asked after the girl and were told she had died .
What do the people of this sterile land eat ?
Almost the only food here is potatoes and beans , and then not always .
Especially in June and July there 's not enough food .
The only meat is pork .
But only the wealthier families have a pig .
Once a year a pig is slaughtered .
The meat lasts three days .
Olive trees grow in more fertile spots .
But the olives are usually eaten by insects .
The best animal for such infertile land is the goat .
Its milk is reserved for the gravely ill , who mop it up with bread brought from afar by the beggars , and given only to the sick .
Goat meat is only eaten when a goat dies .
This happens from time to time on the steep slopes .
The main industry in Las Hurdes is apiculture .
But most of the hives don 't belong to the Hurdanos .
And the honey the bees get from heather is very bitter .
The owners of the hives are from La Alberca .
They only let the Hurdanos have the hives in winter .
It 's milder here than in the neighbouring province of Salamanca .
In spring they take the hives to Castilla .
Then , it 's common to see pack animals laden with hives heading for Castilla .
One day , we came across a donkey laden with hives .
Two Hurdanos are taking it to Salamanca .
Later , while we were eating , we were asked for help .
The donkey was tied up and one of the hives had fallen .
It was being attacked by bees .
It tried to defend itself but more hives had fallen .
And swarms of bees had descended on it .
An hour later it was dead .
May and June are the hardest months in Las Hurdes .
The potatoes have run out .
The villagers eat unripe cherries .
It gives them dysentery .
This is when the exodus begins .
All the able-bodied men who don 't have a fever head for Castilla or Extremadura to find work in the fields .
We came across several of these caravans : of 10 , 30 , 50 men .
They were carrying only a blanket .
They have neither money nor bread and they are going on foot to find work .
We came upon another group several days later .
They were returning as they 'd come , without money or bread .
How do the Hurdanos prepare the land to grow their crops ?
First they choose a spot close to the riverbank .
Then they cut down the rockrose and heather .
Their tools are rudimentary : pickaxe and shovel .
These are the only tools they have .
The plough is almost unknown .
Once the plot has been cleared they put up stone walls , without mortar .
The wall will protect the plot from winter floods .
One the wall is up , they have to look for fertile soil in the hills .
They put it in sacks and carry them through the brambles to their plots .
This usually takes several weeks .
A thin layer of fertile soil now covers the plots .
The first year sees an abundant harvest , but then the soil is exhausted .
There 's no nitrogen and it turns sterile .
All the plots in Las Hurdes are thin bands beside a river .
Winter storms can destroy the work of a whole year .
A characteristic winding river in Las Hurdes with tiny plots beside it .
With no money or domestic animals . the Hurdanos have no fertiliser .
They have to go up into the hills to look for it .
That 's what this family is doing .
The way is hard and footwear is scarce .
The best fertiliser is made by the Hurdanos themselves from the dry leaves of the strawberry tree .
They fill their sacks with the precious leaves .
But there are many snakes hereabouts .
This villager was bitten a few days ago while collecting leaves .
The bite itself is hardly ever mortal .
But , by trying to cure themselves , the Hurdanos sometimes die .
Having collected their leaves the villagers return home .
They spread out the contents of their sacks indoors .
People and animals alike sleep on the leaves .
The leaves gradually decompose . And , several months later : ... they can be used as fertiliser .
A house in Fragosa .
A bed of leaves extends from the doorway .
Every home in Las Hurdes is like this .
A typical interior .
The utensils are primitive and few .
The smoke escapes where it can .
There 's no chimney or windows .
In summer the water courses run almost dry .
This leads to malaria brought by anophelese mosquitos .
Almost everyone in Las Hurdes has malaria .
A battle against the disease is being fought by doctors in the three " Trading Posts " of Las Hurdes .
The larvae have to rise to the surface to breathe .
If it stays parallel to the surface it 's anophelese .
If it stays perpendicular , it 's a culex larva : and harmless .
The adult anophelese is found in every home .
See how it rests perpendicular to the wall .
The outcome of an anophelese bite .
This man has a fever .
We encounter many sick people in the streets .
This sick woman on a balcony is unaware of our presence .
Balconies are rare in Las Hurdes .
There are many dwarfs and cretins in Las Altas Hurdes .
Their families usually employ them as goat herds .
Some are dangerous .
They flee from other people or attack them with stones .
They are found at nightfall in the hills as they return to their village .
We found it very hard to film them .
The realism of a painting by Zurbaran or Ribera is nothing to reality itself .
The degenaration of these people is caused mainly by hunger lack of hygiene , poverty and incest .
The shortest person here is 28 years old .
An older cretin .
We were only able to film these virtual savages with the help of a friend from Las Hurdes , who acted as intermediary .
One day we saw a group of people in front of a doorway .
A child has just died .
The mother .
A death is one of the rare events in these miserable villages .
The women gather at the house of the deceased .
It 's hard to transport a corpse .
Most villages don 't have a cemetery .
They have to take this child to the cemetery in Nunomoral .
We decided to follow .
The body was placed on a trough and carried for several miles through the thickets .
If the dead person is an adult the body is tied to a ladder and carried to the cemetery .
It 's a journey that can take hours .
Crossing a river with a corpse .
Despite the misery in which the Hurdanos live their moral and religious sense is the same as anywhere else in the world .
Each grave is indicated by a cross .
Or by a piece of wood .
The only luxuries in Las Hurdes are the churches .
This is in one of the poorest villages .
A better-off home .
Father , son , daughter-in-law and two grandchildren .
The paper cut-outs on the wall add a touch of interior design .
In some villages , a woman roams the streets at night .
She announces deaths .
She rings a bell and stops to pray .
Everyone lives in a single room .
But this home is a little more comfortable .
There 's a stable on the ground floor and upstairs a kitchen and living space .
There 's even a bed .
In winter , the Hurdanos sleep fully clothed .
The wear their clothes until they wear out .
This woman says :
" Nothing keeps one awake more than thoughts of death ...
" Or reciting an Ave Maria for someone 's soul . "
We left after two months in Las Hurdes .
The misery shown in this film is not without remedy .
Elsewhere in Spain , hill people , peasants and workers have achieved better conditions through mutual self-help .
They have made demands of the authorities for a better life . ... will give impetus to the coming elections and lead to a Popular Front government .
The military rebellion backed by Hitler and Mussolini seeks to bring back the privileges of the rich .
But the workers and peasants of Spain will defeat Franco and his cronies . With the help of anti-fascists from all over the world civil war will give way to peace , work and happiness .
And the miserable homes you saw in this film will disappear for ever .

Inspector .
What is it ?
Hofmeister would like to speak with you , Inspector .
What ?
Our former colleague who got into trouble with foreign currency ?
That scoundrel ?
Tell him his call is the most shameless affront I 've ever experienced !
And tell him to go to hell !
I 'm sorry , but Inspector Lohmann has already left and he says you -
And he says you can go to hell !
God help me !
Let me tell you something , Müller .
I once had high hopes for that fellow Hofmeister .
I gave him his first chance .
And what does the scoundrel do ?
He takes a bribe from a black-market currency trader .
Phooey !
The man I would have staked my life for disgraces me by getting fired from the service
Police headquarters . Inspector Lohmann 's office .
He has to hear me out , for God 's sake !
Tell him it 's a matter of life and death .
Inspector , I think you really ought to -
Of course I 'll miss the first act again !
I want to redeem myself in his eyes !
I finally figured out their scheme . It 's a monstrous business !
They 've nearly done me in three times !
I hardly dare cross the street !
Lohmann speaking .
What is it ?
Inspector ?
Thank you .
Cut out the nonsense and tell me what 's wrong .
Yes , Inspector .
I 've finally discovered -
Just a moment , please .
Just in case , Inspector , please have a record made of my report .
Headphones .
Take this down . I was actually tracing counterfeit money .
I wanted to redeem myself in your eyes , Inspector .
For four days - 96 hours -
I lay up there at the air vent , and now I know who 's behind it all .
But you 'll probably think I 'm crazy .
Who is it ?
I swear I 'm telling the truth .
I know who 's behind it all ! I heard his name with my own ears !
And now they know I know the name .
The lights have gone out !
Lohmann , help me , for God 's sake !
Can you trace that call ?
For God 's sake !
Hofmeister !
What street ?
Number 23 ?
Thanks .
Gloria
Lovely are the maidens in Batavia
Dear God . He must have gone out of his mind from terror .
A pathological condition that is not as rare as one might suspect .
Exposure to catastrophes such as explosions , earthquakes and railway accidents - in short , exposure to fright and horror often triggers insanity .
Perhaps the most interesting case of such pathological conditions is the case of Dr. Mabuse .
Here he goes again .
I shall briefly recount the history of this case .
The patient lived a decidedly double life .
He was a renowned doctor with a large private practice .
Aided by an almost superhuman logic , he used his profound knowledge of hypnosis to commit crimes of a magnitude previously deemed impossible .
For months the police sought the mastermind behind those crimes , the man behind the curtain . At last they discovered his whereabouts .
But Mabuse decided not to flee but rather to mount armed resistance , and he barricaded himself in his house with four loyal henchmen .
He refused demands to surrender to state authorities , saying ,
" I am the state ! "
A barrage of bullets forced the police to retreat . Finally , soldiers stormed the house with hand grenades .
Two of the defenders were killed .
Two were captured .
Mabuse , however , had disappeared .
One prisoner revealed his hiding place :
a counterfeiting lab from which he planned to launch a massive attack on the German currency system .
The police force their way in to seize him only to find he had gone hopelessly insane .
Judging by his incoherent remarks , he had seen , during the previous night , the ghosts of all those he had slain .
Apparently it was the horror of that experience that overpowered this phenomenal mind , which for so long had straddled the fine line between genius and madness , and literally deranged it .
Mabuse was committed to an insane asylum and to this day has not spoken a word to anyone .
Silent and motionless , he remains in the position you see here .
The patient withdrew into his own ego , depriving us of any glimpse into his inner life .
But suddenly the clinical profile changed .
We observed that Mabuse 's hand continuously made writing motions in the air , on the wall and on the bedspread .
We gave him pencil and paper .
At first , he covered the paper with senseless scribbling .
Two years ago , however , certain words began to appear on the paper . Then , sentences began to form , still meaningless and confused .
Gradually they grew more coherent and logical , and at last we began to get glimpses into the extraordinary phenomenon that was his mind .
His thoughts still move in the same criminal channels as before .
Whatever Mabuse writes is based upon incontrovertible logic and serves as a perfect guide for the commission of crimes worked out to the minutest detail .
No .
Nothing can happen to us if we follow the doctor 's methods . - Oh , yeah ? - What do you mean , " oh , yeah " ?
The first attacks on the snitch failed .
So what ? Tough luck .
So we called in Division 2-B to handle the matter .
If they succeed , fine .
And if they don 't - if it looks like that snitch might rat on us - one single phone call and this whole place gets blown sky-high .
Stop scratching , Fritzi .
It won 't come to that .
Before that guy can open his mouth , he 'll be done for .
I 'd feel better if they didn 't resort to murder . What do you mean , murder ?
A guy can have something fall on his head , can 't he ?
A nice , clean little accident .
I don 't care how you make it look . I just don 't want anything to do with murder .
Can 't bear the sight of blood ?
Let me tell you something , though it 's really none of your damn business .
I 've killed two people . I know what it means to kill .
And that 's precisely why
I want nothing to do with murder . Leave him alone , Fritzi . What do you know about Kent ?
The phone !
Yeah ?
Bravo !
Just 20 minutes later ?
Lohmann himself ?
Continue writing .
Hofmeister himself has disappeared .
The rug has been moved toward the window .
He was on the phone when the lights went out . Where 's the light switch ? - Here by the door .
So it came from over there , the unknown horror , the thing that caused his mind to snap .
And he backed away from it step by step , right up to the window .
I wonder if he - No , he couldn 't get out this way . Certainly not downward .
Actual letters scratched into the glass with a ring .
So he was trying to tell me something .
Is that a W ?
No .
Could it be a name ? It may take us a while to figure that one out .
Hey , Kruger . - Yes , Inspector .
Take this pane of glass to my office at headquarters .
And see that you don 't break it , or I 'll bite your head off .
That 's odd .
I wonder what 's behind that .
Thank you .
Keep a careful eye on him tonight . I don 't like his pulse . In any case , give him a shot later so he can get some rest .
Yes , Professor .
Their famous chocolate shake ? And a double mocha for you , sir ?
- With hot cream . - As usual . Very well .
And now tell me , Tom . Why did you ask to see me so urgently today ?
Don 't you know what today is , Lilli ?
Today ?
Won 't you tell me ?
Certainly .
A chocolate shake and a double mocha with hot cream .
You ask what day this is ?
Exactly one year ago today , at the employment office -
Good heavens , my friend , are you back again ?
I 've told you a hundred times there 's no point in coming every day . When we have work for you , we 'll certainly notify you .
I 've been waiting for three months !
Be reasonable . Reasonable ?
What does reasonable mean when a man is going under ?
I want to work !
But they keep pushing me closer to the edge !
It 's enough to drive a man to crime !
He 's forced to become a criminal !
He marches in here and causes a riot !
Don 't get so worked up .
We have others to attend to . - Come now .
- Leave him alone . He 's sick .
- Come now . - Don 't touch me !
I 'll go on my own !
You 'll never see me again here !
- Next , please . You 've seen the last of me !
Here are 20 marks .
It 's all I have right now , but I 'd like you to have it .
It may help you out . I don 't want charity .
I want work , not a handout .
It 's not a handout .
It 's just a loan . I 'm sure you 'll be able to pay me back .
Please .
And six months later , you found work and promptly paid back my 20 marks .
Tell me , Lilli ... have you ever been in love ?
It 's high time I was going . Here comes my bus .
- Please stay . - I can 't .
Good-bye , Tom .
Call me . Good-bye .
If you 'll be seated , Doctor , the professor is due back any moment . Thanks , Winkler .
I 'm sure I 'll find what I need .
Ah , I see it 's on his desk .
Oops .
Oh , dear !
This junk isn 't even numbered .
NOTES BY DR. MABUSE SEPTEMBER 1ST - OCTOBER 31ST
How does this go together now ?
No , the other way around .
Then this page . What 's the next part ? " Jewel - "
No .
" Jewel ry store . "
" Jewelry store ... specializing in high-quality ... "
What ?
" The least conspicuous and therefore most effective precaution to prevent interruption by police , pedestrians and clients is to pull the shades and hang a sign on the door :
'Closed from 10 : 00 to 2 : 00 for inventory . " Well , I 'll be !
" The criminals then lowered the shades and hung a sign outside the door , 'Closed from 10 : 00 to 2 : 00 for inventory . " If that isn 't something !
That 's incredible !
" Immobilize the staff by using gas in bulbs of thin glass , which will burst almost inaudibly when tossed . "
Gas ! Amazing !
Identical , almost to the word !
" The criminals appear to have tossed bulbs of thin glass filled with gas . " " Bulbs of thin glass filled with gas . " If that isn 't Odd !
It 's as if they were following a blueprint !
What are you doing there ? Baum .
This is the most incredible thing you could imagine .
Look here . What is this ?
Where did you get these papers ?
You know what they are ?
Yes , of course .
Now read this .
" Ingenious jewelry heist ... "
That 's right . Read it .
" Jewelry stolen valued at 250,000 marks .
Gas was used on the employees . "
Yes , just as if they were following your Dr. Mabuse 's instructions .
A curious coincidence . Now wait just a minute .
You call that a coincidence ?
- What else ?
Baum , old man , coincidences like that just don 't happen .
There 's some connection in all this or I 'll eat my hat .
Say , I 've got a crazy idea .
Could this Mabuse fellow be faking it ?
Tell me , do you think that , after treating a patient for years ,
I can 't judge whether he 's really sick or just pretending ? I didn 't mean it like that . But there must be something behind all this .
You know what a genius this fellow was .
It 's just possible that his dead brain has come back to life .
Couldn 't Mabuse be writing these things as a sort of blueprint for a gang of accomplices ? You 've always had a wild imagination .
Just hear me out .
What if Mabuse , with his incredible hypnotic powers , engaged in some kind of telepathic hypnosis from his cell ?
Say what you like , but there 's something weird going on !
Who else besides you knows about Mabuse 's notes ?
You sound just like a policeman .
I think the police should be informed of this strange coincidence .
- The police ? - Of course ! Well , perhaps -
Of course you 're right .
The police would want to know of this . Of course ! I 'll go to them at once .
If I can , I 'll call you from the station .
Good-bye .
It 's been raining . - Thank you , Winkler .
- Good-bye .
Let me repeat that back :
a small blue DKW , license plate 1A 74259 .
Intersection of Grüner Winkel and Körnerstrasse .
We 'll take care of it . Körnerstrasse and Grüner Winkel . License plate 1A 74259 .
Faster or we 'll miss him !
INGENIOUS JEWELRY HEIST STOLEN JEWELRY VALUED AT 250,000 MARKS
Pearls , platinum , gold .
One can do a lot with that .
Can ? Could !
But what will be done with it ?
What 's gonna happen with that quarter million ? Careful .
I ask you -
Will you stay down ?
What becomes of it , I ask you ?
We buy cocaine with it , morphine , heroin , opium , whatever you call all that crap .
And instead of making a killing off the dope and fleecing the types who are crazy for the stuff , they practically give it away .
What good does it do the boss to pump the world full of dope and not make any money off it ?
These things won 't stay down . What does it get him ?
I follow his instructions and drive ten people nearly crazy with threats and blackmail .
And when they 're ready to pay any sum we ask , then I 'm told to back off and forget about the money .
Only result is they 're driven crazy from fear of a scandal . Is that any business of yours , old boy ?
Did you ever fail to get your pay on time ?
That 's not what I 'm saying . Okay , then .
You handle the blackmail , and I see to your alibi .
We get our paychecks like clockwork , so what are you growling about ?
I just don 't get it .
If a woman throws herself out the window , or a fellow blows his brains out , like that bank director , blackmail letters aren 't of much use .
150 grand tossed in the gutter .
ls there any sense in that ?
Or take the new instructions about the explosives , and stealing poison from drugstores - that 's scary business .
As it 's meant to be , my dear fellow . But why , in the devil 's name ?
I think you ask too many questions . The boss doesn 't like that .
What ? You know him ?
No more than you do , or anyone else in our gang .
And I 'm not the least bit curious .
I learned my lesson from your predecessor .
He just had to find out what the man looked like , the man behind the curtain , the boss .
So one day , without having been summoned , he snuck into the famous room with the curtain .
Or rather ... what was left of him .
Cut it out , man . You 're spoiling my appetite .
We 're well paid .
In fact , very well paid .
If something goes wrong , we 'll have cast-iron alibis or a top-notch lawyer .
The boss thinks of everything and takes care of everything and demands not a penny for himself of all the loot .
Not a penny .
See ?
Why doesn 't he take a single penny for himself ?
I can 't understand that , and that 's what 's got me jumpy .
Lots of others in our gang probably feel the same and would like to be done with the whole thing but just don 't know how .
" Dearest Lilli , you dashed off so quickly this afternoon that I had no chance to say what I wanted to tell you . I - "
- DR. MABUSE
You say you searched the furthest precincts and found no trace of Hofmeister ? His description was sent to all officers ?
Inspector Lohmann asks if you had the hospitals searched .
A special squad did that , and Hofmeister hasn 't been admitted anywhere ?
- Damn it ! - You 'll call back ? Wait a minute .
Get a picture of Hofmeister from the files .
We may need to have posters printed up .
Now , then , what is your assessment of the murder in the automobile ?
So far , all I know is that the killer used a 7.65-mm Dreyse pistol , from 1906, production of which ended in 1916 .
This weapon was fired from a distance of not more than 25 feet .
No empty shells were found in the street nor on the sidewalk , and the bullet 's trajectory indicates the shot was not fired from a window but rather from a point almost level with the victim 's head .
We may therefore conclude the shot was fired from another vehicle .
Another vehicle ?
That would be very interesting indeed .
That opens up a whole new perspective .
Inspector Lohmann 's office . Not bad . Excuse me , Inspector .
It 's Habermann . This is about the Kramm homicide .
Inspector , we 've traced the murder victim 's actions up until 6 : 10 on the evening of the murder .
Where he was from then until the time of death we have not yet been able to establish .
See that you find out where he was those last two hours . Very well .
Müller , arrange to have - No , wait .
Where 's the text for the Kramm homicide poster ?
Here it is .
" All information will be kept confidential " -
Put another line in here :
" Especially concerning the hours from 6 : 00 to 8 : 00 p.m. "
I 'll do it myself .
Photo department .
Trouble ?
I don 't know .
I 'm just doing it now .
Enlargements , naturally .
Trace the scratches and see if you can 't link them together into a word or name or something .
I 'm sure Hofmeister intended to - Inspector , they found Hofmeister !
Where ? The police station at Schöneberger Ufer .
A police patrol found him .
At first they thought he was just another drunk because he kept babbling to himself incessantly .
But then they heard him call your name . Inspector Lohmann .
Why won 't you listen to me , for God 's sake ?
Inspector , you must listen to me .
It 's a matter of life and death .
Inspector Lohmann , please listen , for the love of God !
The moment he thinks he 's being watched , he starts singing .
When he thinks he 's alone , he calls your name .
I 'll leave you alone now .
Hofmeister , don 't you recognize me ?
Hofmeister , it 's me , Lohmann .
Your old friend Lohmann .
My God !
Inspector Lohmann ? Why don 't you come to the phone ?
For God 's sake , come to the phone , Inspector Lohmann .
Come to the phone !
Detective Inspector Lohmann . Who is it , please ?
Inspector ?
Is that you , Hofmeister ?
This is Lohmann .
We 'll have no other choice but to commit the poor devil to an institution .
Poor devil , eh ?
Heaven help me if I ever get my hands on the scoundrel responsible for that fellow 's condition !
Then he suddenly got an expression in his eyes , those eyes that leave you practically paralyzed !
The eyes of a man who -
If he were in his right mind ,
I believe he could compel people to do his will right from his cell .
The professor must come . The professor is working and doesn 't wish to be disturbed .
Winkler , this is Mabuse !
- Not so loud ! - The professor will fire me on the spot .
With great disconcertment I have found out that in the Hofmeister matter , surveillance at the print shop failed in the most irresponsible way .
Don ' I interrupt . I didn 't ' ask for your opinion .
The Hofmeister affair would have turned into a catastrophe of the first order if not for the excellent work of Division 2-B .
HI come back to that later . Even so , in the future , all security measures protecting our organization will be made much more stringent .
Anyone constituting a menace to our organization is to be eliminated without exception .
Kent , it has come to my ears that you - perhaps due to something in your past - that you do not approve of certain of my organization 's measures .
I 'm warning you , Kent - and I never give more than one warning -
in the near future you will have to prove that you are absolutely committed to our organization , and that you know what you are being paid for .
It 's really none of my business , but I don 't think you 're taking the doctor 's warning seriously enough .
Oh , yes , I am . Division 2-B . No one in the organization gets out of it alive .
It 's hopeless .
There 's no turning back .
" I must say farewell forever , and I can 't even tell you why .
But there 's no other way for me to behave decently towards you .
You will never know what you 've meant in my botched life .
It is very difficult to say good-bye to you , Lilli . "
" Forget me - though I shall never forget you ! "
Those scratches on the windowpane , Inspector .
It took me forever to discover he was writing as if in a mirror .
Using his left hand , and behind his back . If you flip it over , see there ?
Quite clear .
Wasn 't he that -
That doctor back during the economic crisis ? Quite right .
I 've got him . 1920 - 1921 .
Dr. Mabuse " The Gambler . " Come on , let me see that .
Let 's see what business he has being on that windowpane .
When Lohmann has untied all the knots , then you may sweep up as much as you like .
But until then , he 'll go wild as an ape if you touch anything , and he bites . I 'd like to see him try . Müller .
The old man 's coming . Get out !
Müller , come here .
Ca " up 69-19-902 .
That 's the mental hospital run by Professor Baum where they committed a certain Dr. Mabuse .
I 'd like to know if he 's still there .
When ?
Dr. Mabuse died this morning .
This morning ?
Today of all days .
That is quite peculiar .
TONIGHT AT 12100
Something big is on for tonight , it seems .
We 've been called in , as have Divisions 5 and 9 ... as well as Section 2-B .
- Good Lord . - It 's no use , Kent .
The doctor is more powerful than you .
And this corpse is clearly identified as Mabuse ?
There 's no doubt of that ?
Unfortunately not , Inspector .
Unfortunately it is only too certain that this dead man here is Dr. Mabuse . Or was .
Alas .
ls smoking permitted here ?
Seems to me to be slightly , let 's say -
Do you smoke ?
- No , thanks . Let 's say slightly exaggerated .
In the case of Dr. Mabuse , we 're not dealing with a human being of value but with an evil criminal who only escaped the gallows by entering an insane asylum .
One less insane criminal in the world . Silence ! You have no idea .
No one has any idea what kind of phenomenal , superhuman mind has come to an end with Dr. Mabuse 's death .
This mind would have laid waste to our whole rotten world , which is long overdue for destruction .
This godless world , devoid of justice and compassion , consisting only of selfishness , cruelty and hatred .
This mind would have destroyed mankind , which itself knows only destruction and extermination and which could only have been saved in its final hour through terror and horror .
Mabuse the criminal ? Mabuse the genius !
His intellectual legacy would have turned your world , with its police protection , on its head !
His legacy ?
You speak of Mabuse 's legacy ?
No . Yes .
Of course , not a testament in the accepted sense of the word .
Just some of his notes , of interest only to physicians and men of science .
I 'm afraid , Professor , that you underestimate the number of subjects in which I take an interest .
Wasn 't a young man admitted to your institution earlier today by the name of Hofmeister ?
May I see that man ?
I 'm terribly sorry , Inspector .
That man seems to be suffering the effects of some frightful experience that he relives each time someone approaches him .
Then he begins singing like a frightened child sings in the dark .
I must therefore request , for the good of the patient , that you refrain from seeing him now . What is it ?
Forgive me , Professor . We only wanted to - They 're waiting for you in anatomy class .
Yes , of course .
Well , I see the doctor 's cell is already occupied again .
Yes , the new one who arrived last night . The professor ordered that he be isolated .
The doctor 's cell just became vacant , so we put him in it .
It 's strange when you come to think of it . For 10 years I 've cared for the doctor , and now he lies down there in the morgue .
Or what 's left of him . TONIGHT AT 12100 - DR. MABUSE
FEBRUARY 15TH TO MARCH 31ST
The empire of crime .
" Humanity 's soul must be shaken to its very depths , frightened by unfathomable and seemingly senseless crimes . Crimes that benefit no one , whose only objective is to inspire fear and terror . "
Because the ultimate purpose of crime is to establish the endless empire of crime .
A state of complete insecurity and anarchy , founded upon the tainted ideals of a world doomed to annihilation .
When humanity , subjugated by the terror of crime , has been driven insane by fear and horror ,
and when chaos has become supreme law , then the time will have come for the empire of crime .
You have the special maps for the northern area ?
The fire in the chemical factory in quadrants E-9 and K-14 -
Repeat that .
" Quadrants E-9 and K-14 . "
They are to be concentrated so as to spread the blaze mainly to the storerooms and depots .
Is that clear ? - Yes , sir . By the time the fire crews arrive , the flames must be impossible to subdue .
ACTIONS AGAINST BANKS AND CURRENCY
- Division 3 ? - Yes . And Dr. Hauser .
Per my orders , the letters incriminating the signatory of the Overseas Bank were not returned to him , even when very large sums were offered , until he agreed to comply completely with our demands .
We are now in possession of duplicate keys to every one of the bank 's vaults , as well as combinations to all the safes and plans for all alarm systems .
Only after successful completion of our mission will the letters be returned . Good . Turn the material over to Division 3 and wait downstairs .
H ! need you later . - Yes , sir .
Division 3, you are to bundle the completed counterfeit bills this morning and affix the stamps of the Overseas Bank .
Per the instructions you have just received , at exactly 11 : 00 tomorrow night you will break into the bank and replace the bills now deposited in the bank with the counterfeit bills so that the bank itself will distribute the counterfeit money . The bank guards are to be killed . Killed !
There mustn 't be the slightest clue to suggest the safes were opened .
Once everything has been executed according to plan , the bank 's alarms must be set off to simulate a burglary interrupted in progress .
Do you understand ? - Yes , sir . Division 3 is no longer needed .
I was here in the afternoon , too , but you weren 't home .
So I waited , Tom , a terribly long time .
Won 't you at least offer me a seat in return , Tom ?
I like rooms that have such wide , tall windows .
Is this true ?
Yes , Tom .
And I gave you my answer , Tom . But you don 't even know who I am , Lilli .
My dear Tom , isn 't that entirely beside the point ?
Beside the point ?
Entirely beside the point !
We 'll see right now whether it 's beside the point !
There you have it , in black and white - just who I am .
Official confirmation with the seal and signature of the prison director and everything that goes with it .
- Prison . - Yes , prison !
Four and a half years in prison !
The last six months commuted for good behavior .
There . Why should I care , Tom ? I love you .
You don 't know why I was in prison .
I killed two people .
One was my girlfriend , and the other was the man I 'd thought was my best friend .
Why should I care , Tom ? I love you .
Then I 'm forced to tell you the rest , Lilli .
I lied to you , Lilli !
Well , I certainly did . Do you know where ?
In a counterfeiting lab .
That 's one place that can use an engineer who 's an ex-con .
If I had only known what I know now .
Along with destruction of the crops , water supplies must be poisoned .
Epidemics of every kind must break down any resistance on the pad of the people . A warning to unreliable elements will not be issued again .
The slightest sign of treachery will be punished immediately by death .
You see , Lilli ? This time you don 't say ,
" Why should I care , Tom ? I love you . "
Look , Tom .
When I received your letter , did you really think me so dense that I wouldn 't sense the despair in your heart ?
I thought to myself , " What he needs is to regain his faith in himself , to believe that everything can turn out well again . "
And I thought to myself ,
" Maybe you can restore his faith in himself if you tell him how much you care for him
and that you will stand by him for better or for worse . "
And so I came to you . Tell me , have you taken it upon yourself to rob me of my last shred of sanity ?
Yes , Tom .
You ! You !
I guess I have no other choice .
I must report that Kent didn 't show up .
Believe me , Tom , your life is just beginning .
A brand-new life , clean , spotless and good .
It 's true , Tom !
We 'll put it all behind us and make a fresh start .
And you know who 'll help us ?
Help us ?
Yes , Tom . The man who once -
When he had to arrest you , he was so decent and compassionate towards you .
Lohmann ?
He claims to have some important news .
Give me a cigar and raise the shades . Then show him in .
Morning , Inspector . What is it ?
Scholz and I think we 've stumbled across something -
Lower those shades . Clumsy fool .
We stumbled across something that might lead us to the jewelry robbers . Is that so ?
We saw a girl running around with a big pearl necklace .
She could tell me anything at all , that she bought the thing at Woolworth 's for 25 pfennigs .
But Scholz knows about these things , and he swears that necklace is genuine .
Well , is it ?
So far all we know is that she 's the sweetheart of a scoundrel who 's an expert on anything having to do with jewelry robberies .
Where are the others ?
Off you go , then , but remember :
Be careful .
Kent !
You were ordered to prepare the strike against the Overseas Bank .
You failed to carry out your orders .
Failure to obey is tantamount to treason .
The penalty for both offenses is death . Let the woman go free .
Do with me what you like , but let her go free .
Good God !
You will never leave this room alive .
What 's that ?
Tom , what 's that ?
You 'll be taking over Kent 's job , by the way .
He won 't be able to do it anymore .
He 's otherwise engaged .
Who could that be ? How do I know ? Maybe it 's the mailman .
Hold on .
Who is it ? The gas man .
I 'd like to inspect the meter .
Afternoon , miss .
You want to look at the meter ?
Come back some other time . I 've got company right now .
- Police . Open up . Look out !
Police ! - Don 't shoot !
- Shut up , you idiot ! Get out !
Quick , out the back door !
Now we 're really done for !
That guy will call all his cop friends .
And on a Sunday , too .
What 're you crying about ?
It 's your own damn fault for firing at him ! Leave me alone , you hear ? Stop giving me a hard time !
Listen , try to knock a hole through the ceiling .
I 'll try to hit the guy and keep him back from the door !
Stay back .
Notify the Special Tactics Squad and get hold of -
Damned scoundrel !
Who should I get hold of ?
It 's no use . We 'll never get out this way .
We could try to break through that .
But the brick , maybe .
Damn it ! Hey ! How far are you in there ?
I can 't hold this door forever .
Lohmann and his whole gang are here .
Lohmann ? That 's it ! I 'm out !
Get yourself killed , all of you !
What do you mean by that ?
What do I mean ? I 'll tell you what I mean !
Watch the door !
Out of the way . Hardy , be sensible .
It 's no use .
Let me talk to them .
Let me tell you something .
Anyone who gets near that door , inside or out , is gonna get it , understand ?
Go keep an eye on them ! Move it !
Almost . Now .
Let 's see now .
Anni , get some towels .
Come on , quick !
It 's no use .
Better keep an eye on the door .
- You and your stupid shooting !
Bredow , shoot anyone who comes near the door !
I 've had enough of this business .
I 've got you now .
Open up ! It 's Lohmann ! What 's the matter ?
- Who are you to forbid anything ?
I won 't land in jail ' cause of you !
Think I 'll let you cowardly swine send me to the slaughter ?
Be sensible .
It 's no use .
I 'll give you one last chance .
If you 're reasonable , we 'll be reasonable too .
Now , open the door and put your hands up .
- Five , Inspector . One , two , three .
A Dreyse pistol .
What do you know ? A Dreyse pistol , no less .
Apparently the former owner - a friend of yours -
- No . - No ?
That 's funny . It says here that the two of you were close friends .
It 's signed by Karetzky , Diamond Anna , and her sweetheart .
One shouldn 't forsake a friend who 's died . I 'm not forsaking him .
That 's more like it .
So your old buddy held on to this gun because he was used to it .
I 'm no gun expert . That 's right . You 're more of an expert on automobiles .
What make of car did Dr. Kramm drive ? A " Hanomag " or a DKW ?
Who ? Dr. Kramm , the guy you two rubbed out from your car .
God almighty .
There , there . Steady , Lilli .
My dear little Lilli .
There might be another way .
It 's a long shot .
- What if we flood the room with water ? - Water ? Yes .
It just might break through the wall for us .
If the water rises , and we 're -
- Here you are , Inspector .
- Thank you .
So you don 't know anything about Dr. Kramm 's murder ?
The first I heard of it was right here .
Let me show you something . Come here . Come , come .
Take a look at this still life . You 're familiar with this here .
A 7.65-mm Dreyse pistol made in 1906 .
It belonged to your friend . He shot himself with it , didn 't he ?
Yes .
Fine .
But do you know what 's in there ? No .
Take that magnifying glass and take a careful look at these two Easter eggs .
Well ? See any difference ? No , not the slightest .
You see , my boy , that 's just it ! None of us police could detect any difference either , neither with the magnifying glass nor in the photographs .
These two bullets are so completely identical that they could only have been fired from the same gun .
Yet one was taken from the skull of the deceased Dr. Kramm , and the other was found in the skull of your dead friend Hardy .
Glass of water , my lad ?
- Cigarette .
So now tell me why your friend Hardy shot and killed Dr. Kramm .
- I can 't tell you that , Inspector . - Liar ! Kill me if you like , but I don 't know what Hardy 's orders were !
- So you had orders ? - Not me .
From whom ?
I couldn 't tell you , Inspector .
I 've never seen the man in my life . Now enters the mystery man .
So you don 't know the man 's name ?
On my honor , Inspector , I don 't know who gave Hardy those orders .
Then there 's nothing we can do .
Dictate for the record what you know about the whole case .
Yes , Inspector . - Müller . - Yes , Inspector .
It was like this , Mr. Assistant Inspector . I was just -
I was just washing my car , because everything has to be in top shape in these days of keen competition . Suddenly the phone rings , and Hardy picks it up .
Then he came and said we were to catch up with Dr. Kramm 's car at the intersection of Körnerstrasse and Grüner Winkel .
Sergeant , take this man away .
Isn 't Professor Baum 's insane asylum on Grüner Winkel ?
Yes , Inspector . So that 's where Dr. Kramm spent his final two hours .
Nothing on him ?
Professor , it 's police headquarters .
Inspector Lohmann wishes to speak to you .
This is Professor Baum .
This man swears you 've been treating him for the last two months .
I think he 's just trying to establish an alibi .
I 'd like to confront him with you .
Without him knowing who you are , of course .
Could you come over right away ? Thanks a million , Professor .
Inspector , when are you going to let me out of this monkey cage ?
My dear fellow , we 're glad we 've got you in there .
Well , Professor , do you know that man ?
Is he the one ? No , Inspector .
Sorry to disturb you , Inspector , but we need your signature here .
Perhaps you might wait in my office .
Room 204 , at the end of the hall .
- Thanks .
- Any of you know that man ?
- No , Inspector . - No .
- Never seen him before .
MURDER - 2,000 MARKS REWARD
Sad business , isn 't it ?
Especially for you , since you were a close friend of the victim .
Yes , we were on excellent terms as colleagues .
The poor fellow even visited you on the day of his death .
You could have saved us a lot of work , Professor , if you 'd reported that to the police .
ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE HOURS FROM 6100 TO 8100 P.M.
This request was published in every newspaper and posted on kiosks all over the city .
And today 's the first time I 've been in town in four weeks .
Dr. Kramm came to look something up in a scientific book in my library .
He left in the best of spirits .
As for his death , it 's as much a mystery to me as it is to you .
Then I 'm terribly sorry to have troubled you for nothing .
Why , it 's Kent !
Who ?
Him .
I asked you if you knew him .
Where would I know him from ? I have no idea , yet you just spoke his name .
I did ?
That was you , Inspector .
Inspector , I must speak to you .
It 's terribly urgent .
I suppose I may leave , Inspector ? My time is -
Of course .
By all means , Professor .
Just a moment , Kent .
Many thanks for coming .
Go on in .
It 's all right .
- It 's tremendously important - - Just a moment . This is crucial :
Do you know that man who just left ?
- No .
I 've never seen him before .
Damn it !
And what is the name of this " boss " you mention ?
Dr. Mabuse . Goddamn it !
Mabuse again !
That fellow is dead !
He 's alive and kicking , I tell you .
I saw the cadaver myself . Bless you .
I think the two of us are living proof of that , though as for " living , " that was pure luck !
Inspector , I put myself completely in your hands .
Last night ...
I could have fled but I didn 't , because I realized this is about more than my life or liberty .
My God , how can I convince you ?
Is this proof enough for you ? TONIGHT AT 12100
Typewritten . That 's no proof .
" Someone else " ?
I 'm not in for anybody . No exceptions . Yes , Professor .
All the evidence leads again and again to that insane asylum .
Müller , get the car . I may be putting my neck on the line , but I 'm going out there once more , and you 're going with me , Kent .
Mabuse is still alive .
- I 'd like to speak with Professor Baum .
- I 'm afraid that 's impossible . The professor can see no one . Just tel !
him that Police Inspector Lohmann wishes to see him . Gentlemen , it 's really impossible .
The professor gave strict orders not to disturb him .
My good man , I must speak with him . Now go on and announce me .
But , Inspector -
I do not wish to be disturbed .
What is it ?
I do not wish to be disturbed .
I clearly said I did not wish to be disturbed .
That 's his voice .
Nice little contraption . Very clever .
No wonder you failed to recognize the man 's voice .
You only heard a mechanical reproduction of it .
But where is he hiding ?
What 's this ? A map of the northern part of town ?
That must be the Löhr Stegerwald chemical factory .
And today 's date . Strange .
Very strange .
There 's something else here .
It 's in pencil .
8 : 30 p.m. , and today 's date .
It 's now 9 : 10 . Kent , call the chemical plant .
There won 't be anyone there , but they must have guards .
And here 's something else .
" Notes by Dr. Mabuse " ?
Isn 't that interesting .
Go ahead . Good Lord ! The chemical factory !
Here 's your line , Inspector .
Police headquarters ? Inspector Lohmann .
- Nothing .
Krause !
Where 's my driver ?
Krause !
Where is that guy ?
Krause ! I 'll drive , Inspector .
Push that car out of the way .
Come on !
Get the spare .
The empire of crime ...
The empire of crime ...
Permit me to introduce myself .
My name is Mabuse .
Dr. Mabuse .
For heaven 's sake !
Who opened that door ? Run and get help !
He 'll kill him !
Police . We 're looking for -
Inspector !
Come , my boy .
There 's nothing left to do here for a mere police inspector .
On yonder rock reclining
That fierce and swarthy form behold
Fast his hand his carbine hold
'Tis his best friend of old
This way his steps inclining
His scarlet plume waves o ' er his brow
And his velvet cloak hangs low
Playing in careless flow
Tremble !
E 'en while the storm is beating
Afar hear echo repeating
Diavolo , Diavolo , Diavolo !
Tremble !
E 'en while the storm is beating
Afar hear echo repeating
Diavolo , Diavolo , Diavolo !
Well , dark eyes , who 's your last lover , huh ?
What success , Diavolo ?
Great success with the prettiest wench in all Christendom .
The devil with wenches .
Did you get a goose for us to pick ?
" Goose " is the very word .
A skinny old lord who simply stinks with gold ... ... and his pretty wife ... ... whose jewels sparkle like an early frost on a December morning .
- Did you steal them ?
- Of course not .
She knew me only as the Marquis de San Marco ... ... and as such , I could only sing her a song and steal her heart .
And there was I , sitting in the very same coach with them .
His Lordship , that was her husband , sitting here ... ... Her Ladyship , and what a ladyship , sitting there .
And here was I , dressed as the marquis , and what a marquis .
The gondolier
Fond passion ' s slave
Will for his love Each danger brave
Winds and waves
Both disdained
From his fair one 's bright eyes
Be a glance but his prize
It is still something
Something gained
It is still
It is still
It is still something gained
It is still
It is still
It is still something gained
Lovely lady , this pearl grows yellow against the marble of your hand .
Well , yellow or not , it cost my husband 50,000 francs .
No .
And this medallion cost him 1 00,000 .
One hundred thousand francs .
- What a waste of money .
- Sir ?
When even diamonds grow dull beneath the sparkle of your eyes .
Oh , milord .
But isn 't your husband afraid to let his pretty wife travel with all these jewels ?
- Oh , why , this isn 't the half of them .
- No ?
- Just wait till you see .
- What ?
I 'll wager this is the richest fruitcake you 've ever seen .
Too rich , milady , too rich .
Why , this road is overrun with the worst bandits in Italy .
Oh , they 'll never find my jewels .
Nor my husband 's 500,000 francs .
Francs ?
Francs ?
Who said 500,000 francs ?
I was just saying , my love , that you 're far too clever ... ... for those nasty , nasty bandits .
I wish I were as clever with popinjays .
And that 's how I found milady 's jewels .
As a marquis , I uphold tradition .
You hold up the coach .
Tonio , Alessandro , come with me .
I want a word with you .
Drink , for joy bestowing Around , around , the wine is flowing
Wine 's the soldier 's shield In the tented field
Wine 's the soldier 's shield In the tented field ls there anything I can do to help you , Father , dear ?
Yes , there is .
Stay away from that poverty-stricken young soldier ... ... or all the plans I have made for you will be spoiled .
But , Father , I love Lorenzo , and I 'm not afraid of poverty .
But I am .
But , Father , perhaps Lorenzo and I could save enough- -
You 'll marry Francesco tomorrow .
- But , Father- -
- Not another word .
Love and wine his toils repay
Don 't weep , dear .
What did your father have to say ?
- l 've got to marry Francesco .
- You don 't have to marry anyone .
- Why don 't you just flatly refuse .
- You don 't understand .
It isn 't that simple .
Father hasn 't a lira , and he 's going to lose the inn .
Oh , if I could only capture Diavolo .
But , darling , you 've been on his trail for months , and he always slips away .
Yes , but each time I 've been a little closer .
And one of these days he 'll not slip away .
- Come on .
- Well , he won 't go .
Well , don 't sit there dreaming .
Do something .
Well , what can I do ?
He won 't pay any attention to me .
Why don 't you give him a couple of :
- l don 't want to do that yet .
- Why ?
I 'm saving it for the hills .
Come on .
" Saving it for the hills . "
Just a moment .
- What 'd you do with our money ?
- l got it in the saddlebag .
You 'd better give it to me .
It 'll be safer in my hands .
Our life savings .
Wouldn 't it be terrible if we lost this ?
After all the years we have toiled and slaved for it ?
Why , we 've even gone without the necessities of life ... ... deprived ourselves of food , actually starved .
But now we have our reward .
We can settle down for life and live on the fat of the land .
Keep your hands where they are .
Hand it over .
There it goes .
After all we went through to get it .
Oh , well .
Come easy , go easy , that 's my motto .
What do you mean , " come easy , go easy " ?
Now we 've got to start all over again , right at the bottom .
Why don 't we start at the top ?
- What do you mean ?
- Well , why don 't we become bandits ?
Then we wouldn 't have to work hard anymore .
Let 's get it the easy way .
We could rob the rich and give them to the poor , and we could have all- -
That 's the first time that you 've shown any intelligence .
Well , it 's the first time you 've listened to me .
You know , if you 'd listen to me once in a while , you 'd be a lot better off .
I guess you 're right .
Tell me that plan again .
- All of it ?
- Certainly , certainly .
Well , if- - lf we became rich and- -
And we robbed the poor and we gave them to the bandits ... ... and we could start at the top ... ... and we 'd get to the bottom without working hard anymore .
We can 't go wrong .
It 's the law of conversation .
What do you mean ?
Well , as ye cast your bread on the waters , so shall ye reap .
- That 's very well thought out .
- l 'm glad you agree .
You know , there 's one thing that 's bothering me , though .
What 's that ?
We don 't know anything about being bandits .
- l never- -
- Why , it 's simple .
We can be bandits .
It doesn 't require any brains .
Come on .
Your money or your life .
Your money or your life .
Your money or your life .
What ?
Your money or your life .
We 're a couple of bandits .
We 've come to take your money .
You wouldn 't rob me .
I can 't afford to give you any money .
I 'm a poor , hard-working old man .
The father of 1 6 children .
It takes all I can earn ... ... to put bread in their poor little hungry mouths .
I 've got a sick wife ... ... and Grandma don 't feel so well either .
Look at me .
Look at me .
I got one foot in the grave .
You wouldn 't rob me ... ... and see my little ones go without .
Would you ?
Oh , thank you , sir .
From now on , I 'll do the robbing .
On yonder rock reclining
That fierce and swarthy form behold
Fast his hand his carbine hold
'Tis his best friend of old
- Diavolo .
- Come on , boys .
Run for your lives .
Run .
Diavolo .
- Run for your lives .
- Come on .
- Diavolo .
- Diavolo !
- Run for your lives ! Run for your lives !
- Run for your lives .
Tremble !
- lt 's Diavolo .
- Diavolo !
Run for your lives !
Come on , hide .
What 's going on here ?
That was Fra Diavolo .
He 's a bloodthirsty villain and the terror of the countryside .
If you ever cross his path , he 'll cut your throat from ear to ear .
Have a care .
Have a care .
Maybe we 'd better not be bandits .
Tut , tut , tut .
Do you think that I 'm perturbed by his idle twaddle ?
- Well , he said , " Have a care . "
- Come on .
But suppose we meet this Diavolo .
All we have to do is to watch our p 's and q 's .
Don 't you think that I know a bandit when I see one ?
Well , I don 't wanna walk around with my throat cut .
My lord and lady have been robbed My lord and lady have been robbed
- My lord and lady have been robbed - My lord and lady have been robbed
My lord and lady have been robbed My lord and lady have been robbed
Find out which way the coach came , then assemble the troops .
My lord and lady have been robbed
- What are you going to do ?
- Don 't you see , dear ?
This must be the work of Diavolo .
It 's our one big chance .
- Do be careful .
- Careful .
I 'll take charge of this one .
You 've gotten us into enough trouble .
Stand and deliver .
Deliver to whom ?
Tell him who you are , that 'll scare him .
I am Diavolo .
Yeah , and if you 're not careful , he 'll cut your throat from here to there .
All over the countryside .
You better watch your q 's and p 's .
So you are Fra Diavolo ?
'Tis true you 've never seen my face , but you 've heard my voice .
On yonder rock reclining
Diavolo ... .
On yonder rock reclining- -
Diavolo the bandit stands
In his hand his carbine hold
'Tis his best friend of old
Tremble !
E 'en while the storm is beating
A while hear echo repeating
Diavolo , Diavolo , Diavolo
Gentleman , allow me to introduce you to our rival competitors .
If you hadn 't arrived in the nick of time , Diavolo would have been no more .
With such ruffian as these in our midst ... ... everybody 's life 's in danger .
- Well , what shall we do with them , boys ?
- Hang them !
Hanging it shall be .
Throw a rope over that tree .
Please , sir , spare our lives .
First you steal my name , and then you hold me up .
- Hanging 's too good for you .
- Oh , please , give us another chance .
We didn 't mean to hold you up .
We were just coming around ... .
All right , all right .
I 'll give you another chance .
Can we go now ?
You shall be the executioner ... ... and hang that overfed windbag .
And if you make a good job of it , you can go free .
- Well , boys , did you hold up the coach ?
- Yeah .
Well , let 's see what you got .
And if he 's not strung up by the time I 'm through :
- Well , let 's see what you 've got .
- Aye .
A king 's ransom there , boys .
Don 't hurt him , mister .
Hold on .
Chief said he had to do that .
Here you are .
Good luck , boys .
- Well , where 's the money ?
- Money ? We found no money .
- You-- ?
You found no money ?
- No .
Do you know what was in that coach ?
Five hundred thousand francs , and you had to miss it .
- Five hundred thousand francs ?
- Five hundred thousand francs .
Dolts .
Fools. idiots .
Louts .
After all my work , you 've botched up everything .
For that , there won 't be any split .
Can 't we at least share the jewels ?
That means I shall have to follow the coach to the inn .
None of us can follow that coach , chief .
- Why not ?
- We 'd all be recognized .
- Yeah .
- That 's right .
There , that 's better .
You 're choking me .
I 'm sorry .
Just be careful .
- Goodbye , Ollio .
- Goodbye .
You know , I hate to have to do this , but you heard what he said .
Please help me make a good job of it .
I 'll do my best .
You know , this is going to hurt you more than it does me .
Put yourself in my place .
I wish I could .
I know just how you feel .
- Goodbye , Ollio .
- Goodbye .
- Ollio ?
- What ?
Before you go , I have a little confession to make .
You remember that girl that you were very much in love with and- -
And you wanted to marry her ... ... and she wouldn 't marry you because she heard you had a son ?
Well , I was to blame for that .
I told her I was your son .
Do you forgive me ?
- Goodbye , Ollie .
- Goodbye .
- Ollio ?
- What ?
Before you go , there 's just one more thing I want to ask you .
What ?
After you 're gone ... ... do you want to be buried , or shall I have you stuffed ?
Why , I think that I 'd rather- -
What do you mean , stuffed ?
Well , I thought it 'd be nice to keep you in the living room .
Now , wouldn 't I look silly standing on a pedestal .
Come on and get this over with .
You 're wasting my time .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
Take it easy .
Goodbye .
Goodbye .
You two , follow me .
The rest of you , get back to the camp .
- He wouldn 't stay up there .
- Good .
Give me another chance .
I 'll find another tree .
I 'll give you both another chance .
From now on , you 'll be my personal servants ... ... but you will only know me as the Marquis de San Marco .
- Do you understand ?
- Marquis de San Marco .
That 's it .
Do ... ?
- Do you understand ?
- Yes , Mr. Diavolo .
If ever you breathe the name of Diavolo again ... ... or tell anyone who I am ... ... I 'll find a tree for both of you .
Take these to the camp .
And after you 've cleaned them , washed them and currycombed them ... ... send them to me .
Isn 't that nice ?
Now I don 't have to hang you .
And I don 't have to have my throat cut , and we can- -
- What 's that for ?
- My son .
Will there be anything else , milady ?
- Oh , just straighten up this confusion .
- Yes , milady .
Oh , those horrible , horrible bandits .
And all those beautiful jewels I gave you , gone .
All save one , milord .
And my money ?
Safe as a bug in a rug .
Clever of me to think of having it sewn in your petticoat .
I wouldn 't dare travel in this country with so much money on me .
But perhaps someone may find it on me .
What- - ? What- - ?
Why ... .
Who , my dear , besides myself , would be likely to see your lingerie , huh ?
No one but you , milord .
One would think , my dear , you 'd never seen a sedan chair .
I am the Marquis de San Marco .
If your inn pleases me , I shall want the best accommodations for myself ... ... and retinue .
All our thoughts will be for your comfort , milord .
You may have any suite in the house , Your Excellency .
Except our suite , I trust .
Milord , I would sleep in the barn rather than discommode you .
Find out your quarters and await my pleasure .
Don 't lift until I tell you .
Up .
- Prepare everything comfortable , please .
- Yes . Go fetch your best linen .
What do you think you 're trying to do to my bull ?
And you had to wave a red handkerchief .
Remember the song you were teaching me in the coach ?
Could I forget the happiest hour of my life ?
Pamela .
Pamela .
Are you going to stay out there all afternoon ?
For you .
Beauty from the beautiful .
Oh , I know I 'm just going to love this romantic old inn .
Look .
What does it say ?
There 's a reward of 20,000 lire offered for the capture of Diavolo .
Come here .
All we 've got to do is to capture Diavolo ... ... and we 've got another fortune right in the palm of our hands .
Come on .
I hope everything will be to your satisfaction , Your Highness .
- l know I 'm going to be very happy here .
- Thank you .
Oh , my dear , I think I require a little exercise .
I 'll stroll around the garden for a while .
I 'll be back in an hour or so .
Time will hang heavy , my sweet , until you return .
- Where is the marquis 's room ?
- Right in there , sir .
At your service , milady .
Oh , don 't be afraid .
I simply had to see you .
You 're a naughty , naughty boy .
Are you angry ?
I 'm very , very angry .
Angry enough to- - ?
To kiss me ?
- Tie him up .
Tie him up .
- Let me out of here .
Let me go .
Let me-
- Let me-
- Let me go .
- Let me go , I say .
- Oh , no , don 't ... .
Put his arm in place .
Who is it ?
What has happened ?
Help me !
Please help me !
- Would you get that rope on my neck- - ?
- Let me go .
Let me go .
What is the matter ?
Help me ! Let me get out !
Help !
Hit him with something so he 'll keep quiet .
Help get something ... .
- Hit him and keep him quiet .
- l don 't know what 's gonna happen- -
What 's the matter ?
Let me go .
Let me go .
Let me go .
Let me-
- Let me- - Let me get up now , will you ?
Come on , before it 's too late .
Oh , well , anyway , I saw to it that they didn 't find my husband 's money .
Imagine a woman outwitting the great Diavolo .
Oh , the bandits could 've found it , had they looked in the right place .
And that place was ?
I couldn 't tell you .
There 's no use struggling , Mr. Diavolo .
Your bandit days are over .
Let me out of here .
Let me out of here .
- Not until we get the reward .
- What reward ?
The reward for your capture , Mr. Diavolo .
- You let me out of here .
- Let you- - ?
That reminds me .
I 'm an overfed windbag , am I ?
I tell you , I 'm not Diavolo .
You don 't have to disguise your voice .
We know who you are .
What are you going to do with me ?
We 're going to hang you from the highest tree .
The terror of the countryside , huh ?
Don 't do that .
Why , if I had my way , I 'd boil you in oil .
- What do you want ?
- You 'll pay for this .
Shut up .
Oh , did- - ?
Come- -
Get up out of there .
Come on , quickly .
- Wind that .
- That ?
Wind that .
So you 'd have me boiled in oil , would you ?
Now , listen .
One more trick like that , you big puffed-up bullfrog ... ... and I 'll cut out your gizzard like this :
Oh , milady , your things are so beautiful .
You have everything .
Yes , everything save one , Zerlina :
romance .
Pamela .
Pamela .
Where is my nightcap ?
On your head , you silly little goose .
- l trust milord is enjoying his supper .
- Too well , Matteo .
I 'm afraid your excellent cheese will steal my rest .
Milord sleeps lightly ?
Well , sleep seldom visits me before the dawn .
Affairs of state weigh heavily on my mind .
is there anything I could do to help you rest ?
Yes , I think you can .
Have you any sleeping powders ?
I have just the thing , milord , left over from a bad attack of gout .
- l 'll guarantee you slumber until morning .
- Oh , thanks , Matteo .
- What are you doing ?
- l 'm playing Kneesie , Earsie , Nosie .
- " Kneesie , Earsie , Nosie . "
- Try it .
I don 't wanna try it .
Anybody can do that .
Do that again .
Kneesie , Earsie , Nosie .
Here they are , milord .
One will be plenty .
They are very strong .
- Send my servants to me .
- Yes , milord .
The marquis wishes to see you right away .
Take this wine to Lord Rocburg with my compliments ... ... then come back here .
I beg your pardon .
With the marquis 's compliments .
Kindly inform the marquis I am very particular with whom I drink .
Why did you drink that ?
Well , I was afraid I might spill it .
Come on .
Afraid of spilling it .
What are you trying to do , break your necks ?
Oh , I should have done it for you in the first place .
- Did you see His Lordship ?
- Yes , sir .
So far , so good .
Now , this is my plan .
You 're to wait in the courtyard until the house is quiet .
Then , when you hear my signal , you 're to climb up to the balcony .
- Will your signal be a whistle ?
- Will my signal be a whistle ?
Of course not .
Do you want to arouse the entire house ?
At the proper time , I 'll sing a certain song .
Silence befriending To aid us conspires
Prudence attending Vengeance inspires
- You can remember it ?
- Yes , sir .
- You 're not gonna forget it ?
- No , sir .
Do you remember it ?
Sing it .
Sing it .
On yonder rock reclining , Diavolo- -
Shut up .
You stupid fool .
Do you wanna get us all hung ?
If I hear a single note of that song again , I 'll- - l 'll cut out your tongue .
Calm yourself , milord .
I 'll see that he never does it again .
When you hear the signal , you climb up the balcony .
- Yes , sir .
- Now , get out .
All right .
Should you require anything during the night , milady ... ... I will be resting right outside your door .
That 's very thoughtful , my dear .
Good night .
Good night , milady .
Wake up .
Don 't you know there 's work to be done ?
Did you hear what he said ?
When he sings that song , we 've got to climb the balcony .
Now , wake up .
What 's the matter with you ?
Silence befriending To aid us conspires
Prudence attending Vengeance inspires
There 's the signal .
Come on . Come on , come on , there 's the signal .
Silence befriending To aid us conspires
Prudence attending Vengeance conspires
Come on .
Come on , get out of there and help me get these ... .
Get that table over there .
And wake up .
Now , go ahead .
Turn it around .
Turn it around .
Hand me that chair .
Hey .
Hey .
Wake up .
Hey , wake up .
Quiet .
Quiet , you fools .
Do you want to spoil everything ?
Follow me .
Oh , wait .
Get off of my back .
- Come on .
- l can 't come up .
Help me get out of here .
You idiots .
What are you trying to do ?
Help me get him up .
Take it easy , now .
Take it easy , now .
There , that 's it .
For a servant There 's no denying
There 's a shape that 's not much amiss
There 's no cause I fancy for sighing When one boasts such a figure as this
I 'm sure , I 'm sure There are some more amiss
You guard the maid closely ... ... and if she wakes up and attempts to scream ... ... use this .
I 'll leave the bedroom door open while you cover Lord Rocburg .
Victory crowned
Victoria , Victoria , Victoria
Let each heart rejoice Pleasure reign around
Raise the grateful voice Raise the grateful voice
We 'll come with victory crowned
Milord , milord .
- The soldiers are returning .
- The soldiers ?
Still let that cry aloud resound
Victoria , Victoria , Victoria
Still let that cry aloud resound
Victoria , Victoria , Victoria
Still let that cry aloud resound
Still let that cry aloud resound
Still let that cry aloud resound
Let the cry , let the cry
Let the cry aloud resound
Dismissed .
What luck ?
Did you catch that murderous rogue ?
We didn 't get Diavolo .
But we found his hiding place and killed 20 of his men .
Bravo , bravo .
Thank heavens you 're safe .
Come , come , my dear .
This night air .
Oh , Lorenzo .
'Tis Easter day , ' tis Easter day Let 's sing and play
Hail , blessed morning Nature adorning
'Tis Easter day , ' tis Easter day Let 's sing and play

Welcome , Francesco .
I am honored to call you my son .
Well , I 'll admit , Father-in-law , you might have done worse .
Francesco , the bride is waiting for your kiss .
This is a lucky day for you , my dear .
- l trust everything is prepared .
- Nothing but the very best .
I 'll take a look around and make sure .
Come in , friends . Welcome .
There 's plenty to drink , there 's plenty to eat .
Hail , blessed morning - -blessed morning Nature adorning

What are you doing ?
I 'm playing Finger-Wiggle .
- What ?
- Finger-Wiggle .
F-l-inger , finger .
W-l-iggle , wiggle .
Finger-Wiggle .
Hold that .
Finger-Wiggle .
Do that again .
All night long , I could not sleep .
I try to do this .
Couldn 't do it .
Now you worry me with this .
What I wish you , I could not say .
Help , help , help !
Oh , I 've been robbed , I 've been robbed .
My medallion has been stolen !
Do you hear ?
We 've been robbed in this very inn .
- l am so sorry .
- No safety for guests in this house ?
I tell you , something must be done about this .
I am so sorry , milord .
I doubt , milady , if we 'll have to search far for the thief .
Do you know , I think you 're right , captain .
Do you remember a figure in uniform climbing up to the balcony last night ?
Of course I remember , and I wondered what he was doing .
Oh , yes , by the way , what were you doing last night , captain ?
Why ... .
Why , after I dismissed the troop , I ... .
I 'd rather not say .
This is no time to keep silent .
I didn 't climb the balcony to steal your medallion , I swear .
Well , I think the matter can be cleared up very easily .
Why don 't we all submit to a search .
I 'm not afraid to be searched .
He hasn 't anything .
Captain , you 've ... .
You 've forgotten your cape .
My medallion !
Milady , I will call the police .
I tell you , I didn 't steal it .
I don 't know how it got into my cape .
He 's innocent , milady , I swear it .
Please don 't arrest him .
It was wrong of him to steal it , but the motive was very touching .
He stole it .
What does the motive matter ?
- Love makes us do strange things .
- Oh , milord .
This young officer was too poor to marry Zerlina ... ... and the medallion would have made it possible .
Oh , don 't weep , my dear .
Love does create a great havoc .
Love ?
All poppycock .
I shall see to it , my dear , that your sweetheart is not arrested .
Oh , milady , I thank you .
And I promise you that I shall prove to you my innocence .
And before this day is done , I 'll turn over to you the real thief .
Doesn 't it strike you as strange that this Marquis de San Marco ... ... though traveling elaborately around this country ... ... is never bothered by these bandits ?
Well , that is so .
Draw him into conversation about Diavolo .
Possibly we can learn something .
If you can go down the cellar without breaking your necks ... ... bring up some of my best wine .
Why , we 're not your servants .
The marquis 's orders are that you are to make yourself useful around here .
And remember , my best wine .
Chateau Lafite , 1 728 .
Now , hurry .
Hurry .
It 's odd that the distinguished marquis , in all his travels over the country ... ... hasn 't met this Diavolo .
Oh , but I have .
- What ?
- Really ?
I haven 't actually spoken with him .
I have seen him .
- But where ?
- Oh , do tell us .
Well , late one evening when I was returning home ... ... I heard a voice singing high above me .
And looking up , there he was , black cloak , white plume and all .
- How romantic .
- Yes , wasn 't it ?
And if what he was singing were true ... ... you know , he must be quite a remarkable fellow .
You know , curiously enough , the song stayed with me .
Let me see , how did it go ?
I remember .
Proudly and wide My standard flies
For daring hearts A noble band
All own my sway
Whilst for supplies
Each traveler 's wealth I freely command
All own my sway
Whilst for supplies
Each traveler 's wealth I freely command
Now a banker I stop
Your gold , your gold Your gold , your gold
And now a lord is brought
Your gold , your gold Your gold , your gold
A lawyer next is caught
Let justice be done
Restore your plunder
Even threefold
Now
A pilgrim before me is led
" I have no gold
I have no bread "
Here are both for you , friend
Peace your footsteps attend
So
So
Swift run the sands of time
Then since life glides so fast away
Let 's enjoy it while yet we may
For fate so kind today Perhaps tomorrow may betray
As new dangers our steps surround
Every moment may be your last
Then with new pleasures crowned Be every moment gaily passed
Oh , what joys divine Does the brigand 's station combine ?
Still gay and at ease Just as a king I do as I please
I plunder , rob , take people 's lives Bear off both husbands and their wives
And oft their hearts to beat I 've made The last with love , the first with dread
One trembling bows with hat in hand The other smiles and says
" Dear brigand . "
Then since life glides so fast away
Let 's enjoy it while yet we may
For fate so kind today Perhaps tomorrow may betray
But as new dangers our steps surround
Each moment may be May be our last
Then with new pleasures Pleasures crowned
Be every moment gaily passed
Be every moment gaily , gaily passed
Be every moment gaily , gaily passed
Be every moment
Gaily , gaily passed
Be every moment gaily passed
Be every moment gaily passed
Be every moment , every moment
Gaily
Passed
Watch what you 're doing .
Hold this while I get off the ladder .
Wait till I put the candle down .
Wait a minute .
Now , when I fill this with wine , I 'll hand it to you .
Then you pour it in there .
Simple .
I 've been waiting so patiently for you .
How did you know I 'd come here ?
Love told me .
Oh , but , milord , you shouldn 't be here in my bedroom .
Why not ?
I simply had to see you alone .
You 're much too fascinating a man .
I think I 'd better go .
What 's the matter ?
Afraid ?
You funny man .
Of course not .
Well , I am .
You afraid , milord ?
- Of what ?
- Of you and for you .
- For me ?
- And your safety .
But I have my medallion .
And perhaps they 'll find my jewels .
Yes , but supposing they steal your money .
As I 've told you before , milord , our money is securely hidden .
Well , who guards it so loyally ?
I do .
You do ?
Well , l- - l don 't see it on you .
Of course you don 't .
Though it 's not very far from you .
Well ... .
Well , let me guess where it 's hidden .
is it in your bag ?
It 's much nearer to me than that .
is it ... ... in your bodice ?
I know .
It 's hidden in the folds of your gown .
- Oh , milord .
- ls it ... ?
is it very close to your fair white skin ?
is it ?
Oh , but that isn 't close to your white skin .
Do you mean to tell me ... ... that 500,000 francs is concealed in that little bit of silk and lace ?
Why do you tempt me so with your beauty ?
Oh , please , milord , please .
Don 't you know that I 'm falling in love with you ?
And that I can 't bear the thought of you belonging to someone else ?
But I do belong to someone else , and we must remember- - l remember nothing else except that I love you ...
... and I can 't stand the temptation of being near you .
Pamela , I ... .
I can 't give you up .
- And yet I dare not stay .
- Oh , but , milord ... ... I 've come to depend on you for the only light and gaiety in my life .
Surely we can still be friends ?
Do you think , with the perfume of your hair , the light in your eyes ... ... the nearness of your lovely self always tempting me ... ... that we can be friends ?
Let me look at you .
You 're spiffed .
Look at you .
Pull yourself together .
Let 's get out of here .
Put that ladder back and come on .
Oh , Pamela , I don 't want to remember you in these formal silks and satins .
I want to remember you as you were last night on the balcony in the moonlight ... ... with your hair framing your lovely face like a halo ... ... and your soft , clinging robe caressing your white skin .
Would it please milord very much to see me in that robe again ?
It would mean everything in the world to me .
Now , you sit right down here and don 't dare turn around until I call you .
What 's the matter with you ?
I 'm spiffed .
Do you want everybody to know it ?
Now , brace up .
My son .
You- - You were gonna have me stuffed .
Oh , Lorenzo .
Do you remember ... ?
For a servant there 's no denying
There 's a shape that 's not much amiss
There 's no cause I fancy for sighing When one boasts such a figure as this
I 'm sure , I 'm sure There are some more ... .
That song .
Why , my dear , all men sing when they 're in their cups .
You don 't understand .
I sang that song last night while undressing ... ... never dreaming that anyone was near .
Well ?
If he was close enough to hear that song ... ... maybe he knows who stole the medallion .
I see .
Well , now we are getting someplace .
Where did you hear that song you were singing ?
Answer my question or I 'll place you under arrest .
Please , sir , we haven 't done anything .
Tell me where you heard that song or I 'll throw you into prison .
Both of you .
You leave us alone .
If you don 't , I 'll tell Diavolo about you .
He doesn 't mean Diavolo , sir .
He means the Marquis de San Marco .
Lieutenant .
Place a guard around the inn .
Let no one leave here without my order .
Attention .
Outside and surround the inn .
On guard .
On yonder rock reclining
That fierce and swarthy form behold
Fast his hand his carbine hold
- Diavolo .
- Diavolo .
Tremble !
Meanwhile the storm is beating
Afar hear echo repeating
Diavolo , Diavolo , Diavolo
- Mine , Diavolo .
- Come on .
Arrest this man .
Also his servants .
Wait a minute .
Come on , you too .
And now give me the jewels .
- Oh , milord .
Milord . - Yes .
Who ?
What ?
What ?
- Your jewels have been returned .
- My jewels have been returned ?
Where are they ?
Where are they ?
What is this ?
My jewels .
Liar .
Thief .
Milord , if it 's not asking too much , the captain would appreciate his reward .
Reward ?
Reward ?
But-
- But , my dear , I never travel with so much money on me .
However , I shall communicate with my solicitor .
But , milord , it 's very important that we-
- He has the money now .
Oh , milord , excuse me .
As the captain has other plans for me , and as I have a little money of my own ... ... allow me to advance the reward .
But I forbid it .
I want to be under no obligation to you .
You are under no obligations to me .
My- -
- Father Matteo .
- My son .
Milord .
What kept you so long , my marquis ?
Have you anything to say before you are shot ?
- No .
- No , sir .
Squad , ready .
Aim .
- Well ?
- Please , may I blow my nose ?
Hurry up , then .
Diavolo !
- Mrs. Teasdale ...
- Yes , your Excellency ?
I again ask you to reconsider .
Gentlemen , I 've already loaned Freedonia more than half the fortune my husband left me .
I consider that money lost . And now you 're asking for another $ 20 million .
But it would only be for a few months to meet this present emergency .
With $ 20 million in the treasury , we can announce an immediate reduction in the taxes .
That 's all of the people are asking for .
I 'm sorry , but I 'm inclined to agree with the people .
- The government has been mismanaged .
- What ?
I will lend the money but only on condition that his Excellency withdraw and place the government in new hands .
- You ask me to give up my office ?
- Yes , your Excellency .
In a crisis like this , I feel Freedonia needs a new leader , a progressive , fearless fighter !
- Rufus T. Firefly ?
I will lend the money to Freedonia only if Firefly is appointed leader .
The honorable Secretary of Finance and Party .
His Excellency , Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania .
- Ambassador .
- Mrs. Teasdale .
It was so good of you to come . I 'm anxious for you to meet the new leader of our country .
No matter who rules in Freedonia , Mrs. Teasdale , to me you will always be the first lady of the land .
Oh , permit me .
This is Miss Vera Marcal . - Ambassador Trentino .
- Miss Marcal needs no introduction , I 've seen her dance many times at the theater .
Thank you .
The honorable Pandooh of Mifhtan .
I must greet his honor .
- What have you found out ?
- Nothing , I 've been waiting to hear from you .
I 've given up the idea of a revolution .
I have a better plan .
I can gain control of Freedonia much easier by marrying Mrs. Teasdale .
Maybe that 's not going to be so easy .
Oh , from what I hear , you see , Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly .
Oh well , that 's where you come in .
I 'm going to place him in your hands .
And I don 't have to tell you what to do or how to ... careful .
I want you to meet his Excellency 's Secretary . - Bob Roland .
Ambassador Trentino . - How do you do , sir ?
- Miss Marcal .
- We 've met .
I hope his Excellency gets here soon .
His Excellency makes it a point always to be on time .
As long as I 've known him , he 's never been late for an appointment .
His Excellency is due to take his station Beginning his new administration He 'll make his appearance when
When the clock on the wall strikes ten All you loyal ladies and you patriotic men Let 's sing the national anthem when
His Excellency is due to take his station Beginning his new administration He 'll make his appearance when
We 'll give him a rousing cheer To show him we 're glad he 's here
Hail , hail Freedonia
Hail , hail Freedonia
Land of the brave and free
- You expecting somebody ?
- Yes .
Land of the brave and free Oh , your Excellency , we 've been expecting you .
As chairwoman of the reception committe , I extend the good wishes of every man , woman and child of Freedonia .
Never mind that stuff .
Take a card .
- Card ? What 'll I do with a card ?
- You can keep it . I 've got 51 left .
- Now what were you saying ?
- As chairwoman of the reception committe , - I welcome you with open arms .
- Is that so ? How late do you stay open ?
I 've sponsored your appointment because I feel you are - the most able statesman in all Freedonia .
- Well , that covers a lot of ground .
Say , you cover a lot of ground yourself .
You 'd better beat it . I hear they 're gonna tear you down and put up an office building where you 're standing .
You can leave in a taxi . If you can 't get a taxi , you can leave in a huff . If that 's too soon , you can leave in a minute and a huff .
You know , you haven 't stopped talking since I came . You must have been vaccinated with a phonograph needle .
The future of Freedonia rests on you .
Promise me you 'll follow in the footsteps of my husband .
How do you like that ? I haven 't been on the job five minutes and already she 's making advances to me .
- Not that I care but , where is your husband ?
- Why ... he 's dead .
I 'll bet he 's just using that as an excuse .
- I was with him ' til the very end .
- Mmmh , no wonder he passed away .
I held him in my arms and kissed him .
Oh , I see . Then it was murder !
Will you marry me ?
Did he leave you any money ?
Answer the second question first .
- He left me his entire fortune . - Is that so ?
Can 't you see what I 'm trying to tell you ?
I love you ! - Oh , your Excellency !
- You 're not so bad yourself .
Oh , I want to present you Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania .
Having him with us today is indeed a great pleasure .
- Thank you , but I can 't stay very long .
- That 's even a greater pleasure .
Now how about lending this country $ 20 million , you old skinflint ?
$ 20 million is a lot of money .
I 'd have to take that up with my Minister of Finance .
Well , in the meantime , could you let me have $ 12 until payday ?
- $ 12 ?
- Don 't be scared . You 'll get it back .
I 'll give you my personal note for 90 days . If it isn 't paid by then , you can keep the note .
Your Excellency , haven 't we seen each other somewhere before ?
I don 't think so . I 'm not sure I 'm seeing you now .
Must be something I ate .
- Look here Sir !
Are you trying to ... - Don 't look now ... but there 's one man too many in this room , and I think it 's you .
Oh , I 'm so sorry .
- I want you to meet a very charming lady .
- And it 's about time .
Just a moment !
I want to present Miss Vera Marcal .
- Go ahead . I can take it .
- Oh , you don 't understand .
- This is Vera Marcal , the famous dancer .
- Is that so ? Can you do this one ?
I danced before Napoleon .
No , napoleon danced before me .
In fact , he danced 200 years before me .
Here 's one I picked up in a dance hall .
Here 's another one I picked up in a dance hall .
Perhaps sometime we get a chance to dance together , huh ?
I could dance with you 'til the cows come home .
On second thought , I 'd rather dance with the cows ' til you come home .
- Where is my secretary ?
- Here I am .
Good heavens , your Excellency !
- Take a letter .
- Who to ? To my dentist .
" Dear dentist , enclosed find check for $ 500 .
Yours very truly . " Send it off immediately !
- I 'll have to enclose the check first .
- You do and I 'll fire you .
Your Excellency , the eyes of the world are upon you .
Notables from every country are gathered here in your honor .
This is a gala day for you .
Well , a gal a day is enough for me . I don 't think I could handle any more .
If it 's not asking too much ...
For our information , just for illustration Tell us how you intend to run the nation
These are the laws of my administration
No one 's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke And whistling is forbidden
We 're not allowed to tell a dirty joke
Hail , hail Freedonia
If chewing gum is chewed the chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden

If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited

The husband steps outside relinquishes his bride
They stand him up against the wall and take away his bride
You have an appointment at the House of Representatives .
Good heavens ! You can 't go with your trousers up !
I can 't , eh ?
Well , they 'll never catch me any other way . - My car !
- His Excellency 's car !
His Excellency 's car !
I 'm in a hurry . To the House of Representatives . Ride like fury .
If you run out of gas , get ethyl .
If Ethel runs out , get Mabel .
Well , it certainly feels good to be back again .
- I have failed , ambassador .
- I know it , I know it , you idiot !
- I 'm sorry . - You have muddled everything .
If you 'd started the revolution as I planned , you in the turmoil ,
I could 've stepped in and placed Freedonia under the Sylvanian flag , our flag .
But Firefly blocked us !
Your Excellency , you have no idea how popular he is in Freedonia .
I 've known of that too !
That 's why I have two spies shadowing him .
I want to find out something about him , something to disgrace him , to discredit him with the people .
Ambassador , Chicolini and Pinky are here .
Now , these are my spies .
Show them in . Wait outside .
We fool you good , eh ?
Gentlemen !
Gentlemen , what is this ? Shh !
This is spy stuff .
- Telegram for you , sir . - Oh .
- He gets mad because he can 't read .
- Oh , I see .
Well , gentlemen , we have serious matters to discuss .
- Please be seated . - Rock-a-bye
Gentlemen , gentlemen !
Now about that information ...
Wait , wait , wait , wait here , have a cigar .
That 's a good quarter cigar .
- I smoked the other three quarters myself .
- Yes . No , thank you , I have one of my own .
Here , try one of these !
Hey , that 's a no good .
That 's a good !
Now let 's concentrate .
Have you been trailing Firefly ?
Have we been trailing Firefly .
Why , my partner , he 's got a nose just like a bloodhound .
Really ?
Yeah , and the rest of his face don 't look so good either .
Well , we find out all about this Firefly .
- Here , look at this .
- Ah , very good , very good !
Wait a minute . We must not be disturbed .
- Yes , sir ? - This is a very important conference .
- I do not wish to be interrupted .
- Yes , sir .
Gentlemen , we are not getting anywhere .
You 're out !
Now gentlemen , please ! Will you tell me what you found out about Firefly ?
Well , you remember you gave us a picture of this man and said " follow him " ?
Oh yes .
Well , we get on the job right away . - And in a one hour , even a less than a one hour ,
- Yes ? We lose a the pictch .
That 's-a pretty quick work , eh ?
But I asked you to dig up something I can use against Firefly .
Did you bring me his record ?
No , no !
And the boy gets-a cigar .
Now Chicolini , I want a full detailed report of your investigation .
All right , I tell you .
Monday , we watch-a Firefly 's house , but he no come out .
He wasn 't home .
Tuesday , we go to the ball game , but he fool us .
He no show up . Wednesday , he go to the ball game , but we fool him !
We no show up . Thursday was a double-header , nobody show up .
Friday , it rained all day . There was a no ball game . So we stayed home and we listened to it on-a the radio .
Then you didn 't shadow Firefly ! Oh , sure we shadow Firefly .
We shadow him all day .
- But what day was that ?
- " Shaderday " ! That 's-a some joke , huh , boss ?
- Will you tell me , what happened on Saturday ?
- I 'm glad you asked me .
We follow this man down to a road house .
- And at this road house he meet a married lady .
- A married lady ?
- Yeah , I think it was his wife .
- Firefly has no wife !
- No ?
- No !
- Then you know what I think ? - What ?
I think we followed the wrong man .
Oh , gentlemen , I am disappointed .
I entrusted you with a mission of great importance and you failed .
However , I am going to give you one more chance .
I have credentials here that will get you into any place in Freedonia .
If I can only ... Ah , here we are .
Are you sure that you can trap Firefly ?
Remember , this time I expect results . - Good-bye and good luck .
- Okay , cap .
- Come on , Pinky .
- Good-bye .
All right , the meeting 's called to order .
Your Excellency , here 's the Treasury Department 's report .
I hope you 'll find it clear .
Clear ? Huh !
Why a four-year-old child could understand this report .
Run out and find me a four-year-old child .
I can 't make head or tail out of it .
And now , members of the cabinet , we 'll take up old business .
- I wish to discuss the tariff .
- Sit down , that 's new business .
No old business ?
Very well , then we 'll take up new business .
- Now about that tariff .
- Too late ! That 's old business already .
- Gentlemen , as your Secretary of War , I ...
- The Secretary of War is out of order !
Which reminds me , so is the plumbing .
Make a note of that .
Never mind , I 'll do it myself .
The Department of Labor wishes to report that the workers of Freedonia are demanding shorter hours .
Very well , we 'll give them shorter hours . We 'll start by cutting their lunch hour to 20 minutes .
And now , gentlemen , we 've got to start looking for a new Treasurer .
- But you appointed one last week ! - That 's the one I 'm looking for .
Gentlemen , gentlemen , enough of this .
How about taking up the tax ?
- How about taking up the carpet ?
- I still insist we must take up the tax !
It 's right , you 've got to take up the " tacks " before you can take up the carpet .
I give all my time and energy to my duties and what do I get ?
- You get awfully tiresome after a while .
- Sir , you try my patience .
I don 't mind if I do .
You must come over and try mine sometime .
That 's the last straw !
I resign !
I wash my hands of the whole business .
That 's a good idea .
You can wash your neck , too .
Peanuts !
Hey , come here !
Just the guy I wanna see .
What do you find out about this guy Firefly ?
You find out-a something ?
You no find out-a something ?
You spy on him ?
You no spy on him ?
All the time I talk to you , you no say-a nothing .
What 's-a matter you no speak , eh ?
Stop-a this ! What-a you find , eh ?
What-a you find ?
That 's-a no good ! Hey , come here . You 're a crazy .
What 's the matter with you ? Why you make a face like-a this ?
What 's the matter with you ? Ah , come on , you wanna fight , huh ? You wanna fight ?
Come on , I give you fight .
Hey , upstairs this time , no downstairs !
Come on .
What you think you are , eh ?
Hey , what 's the idea of fighting in front of my place - and driving my customers away ?
- Hey mister , you got a mistake-a someplace .
I no fight .
You understand , this guy he 's-a working for me .
I ask-a something , and he no tell-a me nothing .
I ask-a why he no speak , all the time he no speak .
What do you think he do ? He make-a fight-a go like this .
Hey , what 's the idea ?
That 's-a not my idea , that 's-a his idea .
All time I say something , he no say nothing .
- Every time I say ...
- Will you shut up !
Hey listen , what are you doing around here ?
Who are you ?
Hey , can 't you say ... can 't you say anything ? - No !
He no say nothing , he ...
- Aw , shut up !
I am-a shut up , but mister you no understand .
Look , he 's a spy and I 'm a spy . He work-a for me .
I want him to find out something but he no find out what I wanna find out .
How am I gonna find out what I wanna find out ... - If he no find out what I gotta find out ?
- Will you quit annoying me ?
All right , I quit .
All you gotta do is make him stop doing this .
Now just for that I 'm gonna tear you limb from limb , limb from limb !
You 'd think ...
You see , I no say one thing , mister , before when you ...
No , no .
Now , now I 'm gonna get you !
What are you doing ?
Why , you ...
- I 'll teach you to kick me ! - You don 't have to teach me .
I know how .
Stop it now . Look out !
- That 's-a good , eh ?
Peanuts !
You wanna be a public nuisance ?
Sure , how much does the job pay ?
I 've got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it .
Peanuts ... to you !
- Have you got a license ? - License ?
No , but-a my dog , he 's gotta millions of ' em .
Believe me , he 's some smart dog .
You know he went with Admiral Byrd to the Pole .
I 'll bet the dog got to the pole first .
You win .
Come on up here . I wanna scare the cabinet .
No , no , he 's not in .
All right , I tell him . Good-bye .
That was for you . I 'm sorry I 'm not in .
I want to have a long talk with you .
Now listen here . You give up that silly peanut stand and I 'll get you a soft government job .
Now let 's see , how would you like a job in the Mint ? Mint ? No , no .
I no like-a mint .
What other flavor you got ? Hello ?
No , not yet .
All right , I tell him . Good-bye .
Thank you .
- That was for you again .
- I wonder whatever became of me .
I should have been back here a long time ago .
Now listen here , I 've got a swell job for you , but first I have to ask you a couple of important questions .
Now , what is it that has four pair of pants , lives in Philadelphia , and it never rains but it pours ?
That 's a good one .
I give you three guesses .
Now let me see , has four pair of pants , lives in Philadelphia ...
- Is it male or female ?
- No , I don 't think so .
- Is he dead ?
- Who ?
- I don 't know .
I give up !
- I give up too .
Now I ask you another one .
What is it got big black-a moustache , smokes a big black cigar , and he 's a big pain in the neck ?
Has a big black moustache , smokes a big black cigar , and is a big pain in the ...
- Does he wear glasses ? - That 's right .
You guess it quick .
- Just for that , you don 't get the job I was gonna give you .
- What job ?
- Secretary of War !
- All right , I take it .
You know , I 'd be lost without a telephone .
Hey , don 't go away , I wanna talk to you .
Now , where were we ? Oh , yes !
Now that you 're Secretary of War , what kind of an army do you think we oughta have ?
Well , I tell you what I think . I think we should have a standing army .
Why should we have a standing army ?
Because then we save money on chairs !
Peanuts !
Scat !
Say , who are you anyway ?
I don 't go in much for modern art . Have you got anything by one of the old masters ?
Not bad .
You don 't happen to have her telephone number ?
Say , you could be a big help to me . Where do you live ?
Well , it 's not much of a place , but it 's home .
Well , I know one thing , I bet you haven 't got a picture of my grandfather .
Not now ! Some other time .
- Your Excellency ?
- Quiet !
This letter 's the work of Trentino .
The man is trying to undermine you .
Now , what are you gonna do about it ?
I 've got a good mind to ring his doorbell and run .
We 've got to get rid of that man at once .
I 've got a plan .
You say something to make him mad and he 'll strike you ! And we force him to leave the country . That 's a swell plan .
Why couldn 't you arrange for me to strike him ?
Ambassador Trentino is a very sensitive man .
Perhaps if you insult him ...
He 's very easy to insult . Why , I said something to Vera Marcal in his presence and he slapped my face .
- Why didn 't Vera slap your face ? - She did .
What 'd you say to her ?
You oughta be ashamed of yourself .
- Where 'd you hear that story ?
- You told it to me .
Oh yes ! I remember .
I should 've slapped Mrs. Teasdale 's face when she told it to me .
- Where is Trentino ?
- At Mrs. Teasdale 's tea party .
- Was I invited ? - No .
Take a letter !
" You are cordially invited to attend my tea party . "
Sign Mrs. Teasdale 's name and tell her I accept . Come on , let 's go .
I 've got an appointment to insult Ambassador Trentino , and I don 't want to keep him waiting !
Step on it !
This is the fifth trip I 've made today and I haven 't been anywhere yet .
You don 't seem to be making much progress with Mrs. Teasdale , huh ?
How can I ? Every time I get her in the right mood to say " yes , " Firefly pops in .
Well , this is your opportunity .
He won 't be here today .
- Are you sure ?
- Positive !
I helped Mrs. Teasdale with the invitations .
His Excellency , Rufus T. Firefly !
Hail , hail Freedonia Land of the brave and free
Gloria , I waited for years . I can 't be put off any longer .
I love you , I want you !
Can 't you see I 'm at your feet ?
When you get through with her feet , you can start on mine .
If that isn 't an insult , I don 't know what is .
Gloria , I love you .
I realize how lonely you are .
Can 't we go someplace where we can be by ourselves ?
What can this mug offer you ?
Wealth and family ?
I can 't give you wealth , but ... we can have a little family of our own .
Oh , Rufus !
All I can offer you is a " roof-us " over your head .
Your Excellency , I really don 't know what to say .
I wouldn 't know what to say either if I was in your place .
Maybe you can suggest something .
As a matter of fact , you do suggest something .
To me you suggest a baboon .
What ?
I 'm sorry I said that .
It isn 't fair to the rest of the baboons .
This man 's conduct is inexcusable !
- Gentlemen ! Gentlemen !
- I did not come here to be insulted !
- That 's what you think .
- You swine !
- Come again ?
- You worm ! - Once more .
- You upstart !
That 's it !
- Mrs. Teasdale , I 'm afraid this regrettable occurrence may plunge our countries into war .
Oh , this is terrible !
I 've said enough . I 'm a man of few words .
I 'm a man of one word : scram !
A man doesn 't live who can call a Firefly an upstart .
Why , the Mayflower was full of Fireflys ... and a few horseflies too .
The Fireflys were on the upper deck and the horseflies were on the Fireflys .
- Good day , my sweet .
- Oh , your Excellency , I must speak to you !
I 'll see you at the theater tonight . I 'll hold your seat ' til you get there .
- After you get there , you 're on your own .
- His Excellency 's car !
His Excellency 's car !
No , no , you don 't . I 'm not taking any more chances .
You can only fool a Firefly twice .
This time you ride in the sidecar .
This is the only way to travel .
Hey , Pinky , come here .
Watch-a the stand .
Come on , Pastrami , come on .
Mrs. Teasdale , I deeply regret the unfortunate affair with his Excellency , but his attitude left me no alternative . - Maybe we can still avoid this terrible war .
- Oh , if we only could .
- Oh yes , I do ...
- Ah ! Mrs. Teasdale , I have been recalled by my president .
- Then it 's too late ?
- Not if his Excellency will listen to reason .
I am prepared to pocket my pride and forget about the whole matter ... if he is .
Ambassador , that 's wonderful of you , but I 'm afraid his Excellency won 't hear of it .
Oh , perhaps he will listen to you !
- Do you think so ?
- Yes , of course !
I 'll call him .
I hate to disturb you , I know you 're a very busy man , but I must see you at once .
Where are you ?
Oh . Why not come over here ? Come in the back way .
Well , if you think of it , bring some cheese .
But your Excellency , you must come over .
It 's a long story . I can 't tell it to you over the phone .
Oh , it 's that kind of a story !
You oughta be ashamed of yourself .
I 'll be right over .
He 'll be right over . Perhaps you 'd better wait outside until I 've had a chance to talk to him .
Very well , we 'll be out here if you want us .
- How 'd you get in here ?
Oh your Excellency , I 'm so sorry to have to disturb you !
- Will you ever forgive me ?
- After I leave here tonight , will you forgive me ?
Here are the plans of war . They 're as valuable as your life and that 's putting them pretty cheap .
Watch them like a cat watches her kittens .
Have you ever had kittens ?
No , of course not . You 're too busy running around playing bridge .
Can 't you see what I 'm trying to tell you ?
I love you . - Why don 't you marry me ?
- Why , marry you ?
You take me and I 'll take a vacation .
I 'll need a vacation if we 're going to get married . Married !
I can see you right now in the kitchen , bending over a hot stove , but I can 't see the stove .
Say the word and you 'll never see me again !
Gloria .
Rufus , what are you thinking of ?
Oh , I was just thinking of all the years I 've wasted collecting stamps .
Oh , I suppose you 'll think me a sentimental old fluff , but ... would you mind giving me a lock of your hair ?
- A lock of my hair ?
Oh , I had no idea ...
I 'm letting you off easy . I was gonna ask for the whole wig .
So you 've come to ask for clemency ?
Your Excellency , the Ambassador 's here on a friendly visit .
He 's had a change of heart . A lot of good that 'll do him .
He 's still got the same face .
I 'm sorry we lost our tempers . I 'm willing to forget if you are .
Forget ?
You ask me to forget ?
A Firefly never forgets .
Why , my ancestors would rise from their graves and I 'd only have to bury them again .
Nothing doing !
I 'm going back and clean the crackers out of my bed .
I 'm expecting company .
- Please wait .
- Let go of me , you bully !
I 'm willing to do anything to prevent this war .
It 's too late . I 've already paid a month 's rent on the battlefield .
Oh , your Excellency , isn 't there something I can do ?
Yes , but I 'll talk to you about that later .
Won 't you reconsider ?
Please relent for my sake .
Well , maybe I am a little headstrong , but I come by it honestly .
My father was a little headstrong .
My mother was a little armstrong .
The headstrongs married the armstrongs and that 's why darkies were born .
It was silly of me to lose my temper ... On account of that little thing you called me .
Little thing I called you ? What did I call you ?
Gosh , I don 't even remember what it was .
- Well , do you mean " worm " ?
- No , that wasn 't it .
- I know , " swine . " - Uh-uh .
No , it was a seven letter word .
- Oh yes , " upstart " ! - That 's it .
Upstart !
Mrs. Teasdale , this man is impossible . This is an outrage .
My course is clear . This means war !
- You runt !
- I still like upstart the best .
- I shan 't stay here a minute longer .
- Go and never darken my towels again !
- My hat !
- My towel !
I happen to know ... that Freedonia 's plans of war are in Mrs. Teasdale 's possession .
- I must get hold of them .
- Yes , but how ?
We have a weekend guest in Mrs. Teasdale 's house .
Miss Marcal .
Now gentlemen , do you mind waiting for me outside ?
I 'll join you in a moment .
Excuse me .
Yes , I am alone .
No , not yet .
Vera , we 've got to work fast .
You must get hold of those plans tonight .
Chicolini and his partner should be there any minute . Do everything you can to help them .
But I must be very careful .
There is another guest in here for the weekend .
Firefly .
I don 't know , I think he is asleep .
Ring the bell .
Push the button .
- You gotta the plans ? - No , but they 're somewhere in the house , and you must find them .
Oh , for Heaven 's sake , whatever you do , don 't make a sound .
- If you 're found , you 're lost .
- You craz ' , how can I be lost if I 'm found ?
Got a flashlight ?
You don 't know how serious this is . If they catch you , you 'll be court-martialed and shot .
Oh , Vera !
I must go before she looks for me .
Now remember , whatever you do , don 't make a sound .
You stay here , but keep quiet .
Remember what she said , if we get caught , we 're gonna get , uh , court-plastered .
Your Excellency , I 'm worried .
I can 't sleep .
What ? You 're worried ?
You can 't sleep ?
That 's fine , now you woke me up . Now I can 't sleep .
It 's about those plans . I won 't rest until they 're back in your hands .
Won 't you please come over and get them ?
Oh , the plans .
Okay , I 'll be right over .
Let me out !
Let me outta here !
Hey , let me outta here or throw me a magazine !
So that 's your game , hey ?
I 'll huff and I 'll puff and I 'll blow your door in !
Come in .
Oh , your Excellency , I 'm so glad you 've come .
I 'm glad I come too .
You gotta the plans ?
Why , your Excellency , you sound so strange .
Why are you talking like that ?
Oh you see , maybe sometime I go to Italy and I 'm practicing the language .
I 'll see my lawyer about this as soon as he graduates from law school .
Your dialect is perfect .
I could listen to you all night .
That 's all right , but I can 't stay here all night .
- Where 's the plans ?
- They 're in the safe downstairs .
I 'll write out the combination .
Oh , there you are .
Here 's the combination .
Is that clear ?
Is there anything else you want to know ?
What 's the matter with you ?
Have you lost your voice ?
Let me get you a glass of water , your Excellency .
Your Excellency , here 's your water !
What in the world is the matter with ... ?
Your Excellency , I thought you left .
- Oh no , I no leave .
- But I saw you with my own eyes .
Well , who you gonna believe , me or your own eyes ?
Your Excellency , I 'm sorry , but this excitement 's too much for me .
- I feel faint . - Wait , I get you a glass of water .
- How about my glass of water ?
- I give up . How about your glass of water ?
What 's that ?
- Sounds to me like mice .
- Mice ? Mice don 't play music . No ?
How about the old maestro ?
Get me headquarters .
Not hindquarters , headquarters .
Rush the guards right over to Mrs. Teasdale 's and have ' em surround the house .
His Excellency , Rufus T. Firefly .
Hail , hail Freedonia Land of the brave and free
Lieutenant ! Why weren 't the original indictment papers placed in my portfolio ?
Why eh ... I didn 't think those papers were important at this time , your Excellency .
You didn 't think they were important ?
You realize I had my dessert wrapped in those papers ?
Here , take this bottle back and get two cents for it .
Hello , boss !
Chicolini , I bet you eight to one we find you guilty .
That 's-a no good . I can get ten to one at the barbershop .
Chicolini , you 're charged with high treason .
And if found guilty , you 'll be shot .
- I object .
- Oh , you object ! - On what grounds ?
- I couldn 't think of anything else to say .
- Objection sustained .
- Your Excellency , you sustained the objection ?
Sure , I couldn 't think of anything else to say either .
Chicolini , when were you born ?
I don 't remember .
I was just a little baby .
Isn 't it true you tried to sell Freedonia 's secret war code and plans ?
Sure , I sold a code and two pair of plans .
It 's some joke , eh , boss ?
Now I 'll bet you twenty to one we find you guilty .
Chicolini , have you anyone here to defend you ?
It 's-a no use . I even offered to pay as high as $ 18, but I no could getta somebody to defend me .
My friends , this man 's case moves me deeply .
Look at Chicolini , he sits there alone .
- An abject figure . - I " abject " !
I say , look at Chicolini , he sits there alone , a pitiable object !
Let 's see you get outta that one .
Surrounded by a sea of unfriendly faces !
Chicolini , give me a number from one to ten !
- Eleven .
- Right ! Now I ask you one . What is it has a trunk , but no key , weighs 2,000 pounds and lives in a circus ?
- That 's irrelevant . - Irr - " elephant " ?
Hey , that 's the answer .
There 's a whole lotta of irr-elephants in a circus .
That sort of testimony we can eliminate !
- That 's-a fine , I 'll take some .
- You 'll take what ?
A " liminate " , a nice , cold glass-a lemonade .
Hey , boss , I 'm going good .
Gentlemen , Chicolini here may talk like an idiot and look like an idiot . But don 't let that fool you . He really is an idiot .
I implore you . Send him back to his father and brothers who are waiting for him with open arms in the penitentiary .
I suggest that we give him ten years in Leavenworth or eleven years in Twelveworth .
I tell you what I 'll do . I 'll take five and ten in Woolworth .
I wanted to get a writ of Habeas Corpus , but I should have gotten a-rid of you instead .
- I object .
- Even I object .
- Then I object too .
- You 're on trial , you can 't object .
Your Excellency , general Cooper says that the Sylvanian troops are about to land on Freedonian soil .
- Something must be done . War would mean a prohibitive increase in our taxes .
Hey , I got an uncle lives in Texas . No !
I 'm talking about taxes , money , dollars .
Dallas !
That 's where my uncle lives , Dallas , Texas !
More bad news .
- Didn 't I tell you ?
- Your Excellency .
- What 's on your mind , babe ?
- In behalf of the women of Freedonia , I have taken it upon myself to make one final effort to prevent war .
- No kidding ?
- I 've talked to Ambassador Trentino , and he says Sylvania doesn 't want war either .
- " Either . "
- Doesn 't want war " either . "
Either .
Skip it .
I 've taken the liberty of asking the ambassador to come over here . Because we both felt that a friendly conference would settle everything peacefully .
He 'll be here any moment .
Mrs. Teasdale , you did a noble deed .
I 'd be unworthy of the high trust that 's been placed in me if I didn 't do everything within my power to keep our beloved Freedonia at peace with the world .
I 'd be only too happy to meet Ambassador Trentino and offer him on behalf of my country the right hand of good fellowship . And I feel sure he will accept this gesture in the spirit in which it is offered .
But suppose he doesn 't .
A fine thing that 'll be . I hold out my hand and he refuses to accept it .
That 'll add a lot to my prestige , won 't it ?
Me , the head of a country , snubbed by a foreign ambassador !
Who does he think he is that he can come here and make a sap out of me in front of my people ?
Think of it . I hold out my hand and that hyena refuses to accept it .
Why , the cheap four-flushing swine !
He 'll never get away with it , I tell you ! He 'll never get away with it !
Oh , please !
So , you refuse to shake hands with me , eh ?
Mrs. Teasdale , this is the last straw ! There 's no turning back now !
This means war !
Then it 's war !
Then it 's war !
Gather the forces !
Harness the horses !
Then it 's war !
- Freedonia 's going to war - Each son will grab a gun - And run away to war .
- At last we 're going to Feet will beat along the street to war - We 're going to war
In case you haven 't heard before I think they think we 're going to war
We 're going to war I think they think we 're going to war We 're going to war going to war
To war , to war we 're finally going to war
They got guns , we got guns All God 's children got guns
We 're gonna walk all over the battlefield 'Cause all God 's children got guns
Oh Freedonia oh don 't you cry for me
'Cause I 'm coming ' round the mountain with a banjo on my knee
To war , to war , to war we 're gonna go
To war , to war , to war
To war , to war , we soon will say good-bye
How we 'll cry for Firefly if Firefly should die .
There 'll be two lamps in the steeple if they 're coming by land and one if they 're coming by sea .
They double-crossed me .
They 're coming by land and sea !
Ride through every village and town ! Wake every citizen up hill and down !
Tell ' em the enemy comes from afar with a hey-nonny-nonny and a ha-cha-cha !
Be off , my lad !
My husband !
Hide in ... hide in there !
- Freedonia 's going to war !
- I 'm gonna take a bath .
Clear all wires . The enemy has captured hill 27 and 28 . Throwing 13 hillbillies out of work .
Last night two snipers crept into our machine-gun nest and laid an egg .
Send reinforcements immediately .
Send that off collect .
Your Excellency , our men are being badly beaten in open warfare .
- I suggest we dig trenches . - Dig trenches ?
With our men being killed off like flies there isn 't time to dig trenches .
- We 'll buy ready-made . Here , run out and get some trenches .
- Yes , sir .
- Wait a minute , get ' em this high and our soldiers won 't need any pants . - Yes , sir .
- Wait a minute , get ' em this high and we won 't need any soldiers . - Yes , sir .
Chicolini , your partner 's deserted us , but I 'm still counting on you .
There 's a machine-gun nest near hill 28 . I want it cleaned out .
All right , I 'll tell the janitor .
Message from the front , sir . Oh , I 'm sick of messages from the front .
Don 't we ever get a message from the side ?
General Smith reports a gas attack .
He wants to know what to do .
Tell him to take a teaspoon full of bicarbonate soda and a half a glass of water .
Yes , sir .
- Any answer to that message ? - No , sir . Well , in that case , don 't send it .
Gentlemen , this is the last straw .
- Where 's my Stradivarius ? - Here , sir !
I 'll show ' em they can 't fiddle around with old Firefly .
Now they know they 've been in a war . - Your Excellency !
- They 're fleeing like rats !
- But sir , I 've got to tell you ...
Remind me to give myself the Firefly medal for this .
Your Excellency , you 're shooting your own men . - What ?
- You 're shooting your own men !
Here 's five dollars . Keep it under your hat .
Never mind .
I 'll keep it under my hat .
Now we 've got to have more men or we 're lost !
Don 't be alarmed , I 've got a man combing the countryside for volunteers .
Your Excellency , the army 's morale is crumbling . The men are breaking ranks .
- Where 's the Secretary of War ? - That 's it !
Where is the Secretary of War ?
The soldiers are waiting for his orders . His Excellency , the Secretary of War .
Awfully decent of you to drop in today .
You realize our army is facing disastrous defeat ?
- What do you intend to do about it ? - I 've done it already .
- You 've done what ?
- I 've changed to the other side .
So you 're on the other side , eh ?
Well , what are you doing over here ?
Well , the food is better over here .
Chicolini , I need you badly right now . What 'll you take to come back and work for me again ?
- I 'll take a vacation .
- Good , you 're hired .
Now , go out in that battlefield and lead those men to victory . Go on , they 're waiting for you .
I wouldn 't go out there unless I was in one of those big iron things that go up and down like this .
What do you call those things ? - Tanks .
- You 're welcome .
Your Excellency , you must come here at once .
There 's danger here .
Why don 't come over here ? There 's no danger here .
Wait a minute , I want to find out something .
Just as I thought , the coast is clear .
Remember , you 're fighting for this woman 's honor which is probably more than she ever did .
Your Excellency ! There goes my gun .
Run out and get that like a good girl .
Oh , I 'm afraid !
We can 't last much longer . Our ammunition supplies are very low !
Man the boats , Lieutenant ! I 'll get help !
Calling all nations ! Calling all nations ! This is Rufus T ...
This is Rufus T. Firefly coming to you through the courtesy of the enemy . We 're in a mess , folks ! We 're in a mess !
Rush to Freedonia . Three men and one woman are trapped in a building . Send help at once .
If you can 't send help , send two more women .
Make it three more women .
Your Excellency , we can 't hold out much longer ! We must have help !
One of us has got to break through the lines and get word to general Cooper and his men .
Quiet back there !
Which one of us is gonna have the rare privilege of sacrificing his life for his country ?
- We draw lots .
- Wait ! I got it .
Rrringspot , vonza , twoza , zig-zag-zav , popti , vinaga .
I did it wrong . Wait , wait , I start here .
Rrringspot , vonza , twoza , zig-zag-zav , popti , vinaga .
That 's no good too .
Oh , I got it ! Rrringspot , buck !
You 're a brave man . Go and break through the lines !
And remember , while you 're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell , we 'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are .
Good-bye , Mont Blanc , good-bye .
- For Freedonia ! - For Freedonia !
- For Freedonia !
Where did they get you ?
Hey , careful with the water ! It 's the only water we got .
Well , it 's the only woman we got .
We 're surrounded ! They 're attacking from the rear !
- They 're coming this way !
- We 'll barricade the door !
This is Firefly talking ! Send help at once !
Help is on the way !
Carry on , men ! Help is on the way !
They got me . They got me . Water !
Water !
Get me outta this ! Get me outta this !
The last time this happened to me I was crawling under a bed .
Oh , if help would only come !
Any mail for me while I was gone ?
Get away from me !
Trentino , eh ?
That 's game .
Call me an upstart , eh ?
I surrender ! I surrender !
I 'm sorry , you 'll have to wait 'til the fruit runs out .
Victory is ours !
Hail , hail Freedonia
Land of the brave ...
Say , Jones and Barry are doing a show .
That 's great !
Jones and Barry are doing a show .
Jones and Barry are doing a show .
Jones and Barry are doing a show . VOICES :
- Testing , testing .
Jones and Barry are doing a show .
You 're telling me ? MAN :
Well , of course , I 'm not a lawyer .
I 'm in the Kiddie Kar business .
I don 't know much about contracts ... but it looks good to me .
DOT : It 's the biggest contract I ever signed .
Thanks to you , Mr. Dillon .
Aw , you could have your choice of a dozen shows .
A pretty girl like you .
Not with this depression .
If not for you and your Kiddie Kars ...
Oh , now , Miss Brock ...
Dorothy , I mean .
You don 't mind my calling you Dorothy , do you ?
Why , of course not .
Well , Dorothy , I 'd like to do something for you .
You 've done entirely too much for me already ... and I just can 't tell you how much I appreciate it .
No , no .
I mean ...
I mean , I 'd like to do something for you ... if you 'd do something for me .
Why , Mr. Dillon , of course I 'd be very glad to ... but what could I possibly do for a big man like you ?
Call me Abner .
When we got Dorothy Brock , we got a great break .
Abner Dillon guarantees to finance anything she does .
These days , stars like Dorothy Brock are a dime a dozen .
That 's what we got you for .
Julian Marsh , the greatest musical comedy director in America today .
What do you mean , today ?
All right , tomorrow too .
Say , with your reputation ...
Did you ever try to cash a reputation at a bank ?
I 'm in this for one reason only :
Money .
JONES :
Money ?
You ? With all your hits , you ought to be worth plenty .
I ought to be , but I 'm not .
Did you ever hear of Wall Street ?
Excuse me , Mr. Marsh , there 's a phone call for you .
A Dr. Chadwick .
- I 'll call him back .
- He says it 's urgent .
About your examination .
Use our private phone , Julian .
What is it , doc ?
You have ?
Good Lord , you 're not a machine !
That body of yours will stand just so much .
There 's no other way .
You 're not just headed for another nervous breakdown .
Any undue strain on your part might easily prove fatal .
Sorry , doc , but I 've got to risk it .
Anything wrong ?
- You won 't have another breakdown ?
- The contract 's signed .
- That doesn 't matter .
- That 's all right . It holds .
You 'll get your Pretty Lady .
You haven 't got anything to worry about .
I 'm not gonna let you down ... because I can 't afford to .
I 've given everything I 've had to that gulch down there .
It paid me , sure , in money I couldn 't hang on to ... fair-weather friends , women , headlines .
Why , even the cops and the newsboys recognize me on sight .
" Marsh the Magnificent . " " Marsh the Slave Driver . "
Actors tell you how Marsh drove them , bullied them ... and tore it out of them .
A few would tell you how Marsh made them .
They 've all got something to show , except Marsh .
Well , this is my last shot .
I 'll make more actors , but this time I 'll sock my money away so hard ... they 'll have to blast to find enough to buy a newspaper .
That 's why I 'm going ahead with Pretty Lady .
Pretty Lady has to be a hit .
It 's my last show , and it 's got to be my best .
You 're counting on me .
I 'm counting on Pretty Lady ... because it 's got to support me for a long time .
- BARRY :
- Remember ... my contract makes me boss with a capital B. What I say , goes .
Now , make the chorus call for 10 : 00 tomorrow .
( DOOR CLOSES ) He 'll drive us crazy before we get this show on .
Yeah , but suppose that guy should pass out on us ?
New York will see its first triple funeral .
Good morning .
Mr. Marsh will be here soon .
Quiet now .
Quiet , please !
Quiet , everybody , quiet !
Hello , Jerry . How are you ?
Hello , Andy .
It 's too good to be true .
How 's the turnout , Mac ?
About 50-50 .
Half are dumb and the other half are dumber .
WOMAN :
He 's so busy .
- Lorraine has been hitting the bottle .
- The peroxide bottle .
You wanna get me canned ?
You 're set , you 're in .
Now scram .
Darling , you 're just too sweet , the way you keep spoiling me .
I beg your pardon .
It 's okay .
This is a two-way street .
I beg your pardon .
But are you , by any chance , the ?
What is the word ?
The stage manager ?
Hey , Ann , come out from under that accent . I see you .
Lolly !
Darling .
You remember Ann Lowell ?
Not Anytime Annie ?
Who could forget her ?
She only said no once , when she didn 't hear the question .
LORRAINE : You been abroad ?
Andy ?
Where 's Andy Lee ?
Yes , Mr. Marsh .
Coming right up .
- Good morning , Mr. Marsh .
- Good morning .
- Line them up .
- Yes , sir .
Okay , girls , line up .
Come on .
Quiet , now .
Quiet !
Come on , now .
Quiet , girls .
I want all the dancers to line up and double-lined out front .
Showgirls can double-line in back of them and the boys in back of them .
Don 't spread out !
Come on , girls , hurry up .
I really had a charming summer in Deauville , dear .
Yes , but don 't you find Sir George impossible at times ?
Get a load of " Minnie the Mountaineer . "
It must have been tough on your mother , not having any children .
That 's telling them .
Oh , dear .
You looking for somebody , or just shopping around ?
Where will I find the gentleman in charge ?
First door to your left , dearie .
- I know , but ...
- WOMAN 1 : But that 's the ... ( LAUGHING )
WOMAN 1 :
Our mistake . The other door .
- BILLY : Hey , wait a minute .
Hey , what 's the idea ?
Oh , uh ... They said ...
Weren 't you expecting me ?
Well , not exactly , but I 'm afraid you 'll do .
Well , I don 't understand .
I don 't either .
What are you looking for ?
Well , isn 't this the ... ?
Wait till I get my clothes on .
I 'll show you where it is .
It isn 't an " it , " it 's a " he . "
Maybe I 'm wrong about the whole thing .
Let 's start over again .
I 'm Billy Lawler , one of Broadway 's better juveniles . Oh .
I thought you were important .
That 's the way most people feel about juveniles .
Only most of them aren 't so frank about it .
- You 're new to show business ?
- Oh , I 've had experience .
- How many shows ?
- Why , any number of them .
- Come on , now .
- To tell you the truth ...
I want the truth .
This 'll be my first , if they take me .
If they take you ?
Say , you can 't miss .
I 'll take you in myself .
I 'll steer you right up to the stage director .
Come on , let 's go .
A short order of ham , coming out .
Not good , but loud .
Honey , take a good look at them now .
Because after they make that back line , you won 't see them again .
If it isn 't Little Lord Fauntleroy and the village maiden .
Just a minute .
Where are you headed , sister ?
- She wants to see Marsh .
- That 'll make Marsh 's day perfect .
Come on , girls , inside .
There 's the boss right there .
His name is Julian Marsh .
He 's the fellow with the light green felt hat .
Go over and talk to him .
WOMAN : Quit shoving .
Lift the skirts up a little higher .
Come on , come on .
Afraid I got a run .
- First door to your left .
- In my stocking .
First offense ?
Yes , but I don 't think I ought to tell them that .
No , of course not .
And they 'll never guess .
Do you think I 'll do ?
I only know what I read in the papers , but you look all right to me .
- Andy !
Get the first eight girls .
- Yes , sir .
Will the first eight girls line up here ?
The first eight girls line up down in front . Come on .
Now lift your dresses up .
MARSH : Come on , higher .
I want to see the legs .
Yeah , they got pretty faces too .
ANDY : Turn around .
Come on , turn around !
Oh , dear , not a calf in a carload .
- Get the next eight .
- Next eight , come on .
Stick with us , and you 'll come in on the tide .
- ANDY : Hurry up , hurry up . - MAC :
Line up , girls . ANDY :
Hurry up , girls .
Lift your dresses up .
- Do you mind holding Fifi for me ? - MARSH :
Turn around now , please .
All right , back .
Three !
Okay those three on the left .
If I were you , I 'd keep them .
I suppose if I don 't , you 'll have to .
Lorraine again , huh ?
Andy , you 're a panic .
All right , have it your way .
Mac , okay by special request of the copyright owner .
- ANDY : All right , next eight .
Hurry up .
- Next eight girls .
What 's yours ?
Diane Lorrimer . 333 Park Avenue .
And is her homework tough !
Next .
- ANDY :
Adams ! - WOMAN 1 : Here .
- ANDY : Kipling ! - WOMAN 2 :
Andy . - What 's the matter ?
Well , what is it , what is it ?
What 's the matter now ?
Must have been a slip-up someplace .
We 're a girl short .
Well , that 's great .
Just great !
We also need a dance director who can count to 40 without a pad and pencil .
- Mr. Marsh ... - Well , do something !
Get another girl .
Are you gonna stand there and shake a blond out your pantlegs ? Yeah , but Mr. Marsh ...
- I don 't want to butt in ...
- A lot of people are like that .
- ANDY : I 'll have one here in the morning .
- That 's ducky .
I can hardly wait .
Mr. Marsh , you don 't have to wait .
And she 's a swell dancer too .
You picked her , but she got eliminated the third time through . - Come out from behind there .
- You , with the legs !
Come out of there .
( LAUGHING )
Quiet !
Quiet , please !
- Quiet , please !
Well , I 'm a ...
Hey , kid !
Hey , you !
Hey , come on , get up .
- The boss wants to see you again .
- Who ?
Me ? Come on , come on .
All right , she 'll do .
They 're all yours , Andy . ANDY :
All right , get in line .
All right , now , everybody .
Quiet , and listen to me .
Tomorrow morning , we 're gonna start a show .
We 'll rehearse for five weeks , and we 'll open on scheduled time ... and I mean , scheduled time .
You 'll work and sweat and work some more .
You 'll work days and nights ... and you 'll work between time , when I think you need it .
You 'll dance until your feet fall off and you can 't stand up ... but five weeks from now , we 're going to have a show .
Some of you have been with me before . You know it 'll be tough .
It 'll be the toughest five weeks that you ever lived through .
Do you all get that ?
Anybody who doesn 't think he 'll like it , better quit right now .
What do I hear ?
Nobody ?
Good .
Then that 's settled .
We start tomorrow morning .
All right , 10 : 00 tomorrow morning , we start with the lyrics .
In practice clothes .
What did I tell him ?
This is what I told him :
" No , I won 't run your stage for that money . "
Great .
You beat Jerry to the finish by two lengths .
All right , take your positions . We 'll try those routines again .
Quiet !
Where do you think you are , home ?
I get back to New York and I get this wire .
Come on , kids , make it snappy .
All right , Jerry , let 's go !
MARSH : Dorothy , that 's your cue .
Things can never be the same now .
I beg your pardon , but would you mind saying :
" Things can never be the same now " ?
- That 's what I said .
- You did not .
You said , " Things can never be the same now . "
- I did not .
- You did .
- Who 's directing this show ?
- She 's reading my lines wrong .
- I am not .
- What did you say ?
I said , " Things can never be the same now . "
That 's right .
Things can never be the same now .
MARSH : The scene ends with you on the steps , and you go into the number .
That 's where you take his hand .
The scene ends with you two on the steps , and we go into the duet .
- Hi . - You 're doing fine for a beginner .
- Well , thanks .
I 'm trying .
I was so scared that first day , I walked around the block four times ... before I had the courage to even come and apply for this job .
It 's tough , but you 'll get along .
Well , I wouldn 't mind , if I could only get that routine set .
I 'll show you those taps .
Come on with me .
Taps ?
Say , I can do a tap dance on my ear .
What bothers me is that routine .
Then I 'm just what the doctor ordered . Come along .
Now , look .
Cross over .
You 're gluttons for punishment .
Well , Mr ...
Well , this boy 's showing me .
- I was trying to make her ...
- Trying to make her is right .
We 'll just let that pass .
Now try it again .
- Where you sitting ?
- On a flagpole , dearie .
On a flagpole .
I always said she was a nice girl .
She 's so good to her mother .
She sure is . She makes $ 45 a week and sends her mother 100 of it .
Get some feeling into it , will you ?
What do you want me to do , bite my nails ?
You 've got the busiest hands .
Wait a minute , wait a minute !
It 's out .
That 'll be enough of that .
It smells .
You don 't like this number ?
Sure , I like it .
I 've liked it since 1905 .
You think this is a revival ?
- It 's out .
The whole number !
- This number will be a riot .
That 's what I 'm afraid of .
Dismiss .
An hour for lunch .
All right , everybody .
One hour for lunch .
Waiting long , darling ?
Well , long enough .
My , but we 're grouchy , aren 't we ?
- Oh , no , not that , but ...
- What ?
I 'm getting tired of this hiding in doorways ... sneaking in and out of places and keeping under cover .
Why , I 'm beginning to feel like a criminal .
There 's nothing criminal in that , is there ?
No , there 's nothing criminal in that .
JONES : I thought we 'd better tell you , it looks like we 're in trouble .
MARSH : That word has a familiar sound .
Are you married too ?
This is serious , Julian .
Serious ? Did you ever leave your wife ... sitting alone in a nightclub , holding the check ?
You know Abner Dillon 's putting up the bankroll for our show .
I knew he wasn 't here because you liked his face .
I don 't like his face or any part of him .
He looks like a Bulgarian boll weevil mourning its first-born .
Well , his interest in our show is Dorothy Brock .
And his interest is our principal .
Very good .
Very , very good .
Even I was able to gather that much .
Well , we stand a first-rate chance of having him ... withdraw his financial support . Yes ?
Now , did you gather that ?
But why ?
Because dear Miss Brock is two-timing Abner right under his very nose .
Who with ?
With a fellow who used to be her partner in vaudeville .
She 's come up in the business , he hangs around .
He 's been out of town and just got back last week .
If Dillon finds out ...
And if he doesn 't , he 's dumber than I thought ...
Well , now , wait .
Nobody could be as dumb as all that .
He 'll just walk out on us and we 'll be sunk , that 's what ... if we don 't do something .
Tried applying dough to the problem ?
Give the Romeo 100 bucks .
Get him out of the way .
We might try using a little flint .
You don 't know this guy Denning .
That 's his name . Pat Denning .
He 's not the kind of guy that gets sent places just like that .
Oh , no , he gets train-sick .
Oh , I see .
Hard-boiled , huh ?
Well , it 's going to be just too bad ...
- ... but nobody 's gonna ruin my show .
- What 'll you do ?
I 'll talk it over with Murphy , a friend of mine from downtown .
- Slim Murphy ? - Yeah .
Murphy will kill him .
That 'll teach him a good lesson .
I don 't want to be mixed up with Murphy or any other gangsters . No ?
One man 's meat is another man 's Murphy .
I told you what this show means to me .
Well , this is what it does mean .
Hello , Murphy ?
This is Julian Marsh .
Yeah , I 'm okay .
Thanks .
Listen to me .
You gotta do me a favor .
Did you ever hear of Dorothy Brock ?
Good , that makes it so much easier .
Well , listen to me and get this .
It seems there 's a certain guy by the name of Denning .
D-E-N ...
N-I-N-G .
I got you , Mr. Marsh .
Hey , pipe down !
What do you think I got on , earphones ?
It 's as good as done .
Say , you ain 't gonna forget me on ducats for the new show , are you ?
Thattaboy !
Not another nickel , honey .
Just can 't be done anymore , that 's all .
Pat , don 't be silly .
We 've always shared and shared alike , haven 't we ?
What 's come over you ?
Getting a sudden attack of manhood , possibly .
Let 's quit kidding ourselves .
I 'm a regular anchor around your neck .
- You 're not .
- I am . Besides , never being able to see you ... except when nobody 's looking is getting me down .
But , darling , I owe everything I am to you .
It was you and that act of ours that started me in all this .
Why , you trained me and coached me and taught me all I know .
I was pretty dumb too .
- I haven 't forgotten .
- The act ?
It was grand , Pat .
Really grand .
- It was terrible .
- You didn 't think so then .
You mean I didn 't say so then .
Oh , Dot , you 've gone ahead .
You 've earned it .
I 've stayed behind where I belong , I guess .
You 've kept yourself behind .
Nothing of the sort .
They wanted you . They never wanted me .
Besides , I 've been getting myself some education ... and they have a name for a man who doesn 't work ... who accepts money from a woman .
It isn 't a very nice name .
- Darling , you 're talking like a child .
- No , I 'm not .
- There isn 't any other reason , is there ?
- No . - Sure ?
- Sure , I 'm sure .
It 's late .
I 'll take you home .
Keep the change .
- Thank you , sir .
- Thank you .
- I wish you didn 't feel that way .
- So do I , but I do .
Watch your tempo !
Watch it , will you ?
Get your feet off the floor .
Faster , faster !
Come on , faster ! Faster !
Stop it , stop it , stop it !
It 's brutal !
May I remind you that Pretty Lady 's out-of-town opening is not far away ?
It 's been advertised as a musical comedy with dancing !
If it isn 't asking too much , will you please show me a little ?
All right , once again .
Give it something !
Come on .
Ready , Jerry ?
Get into it now . Come on !
( PIANO PLAYING )
Having fun ?
After three weeks , a leg ain 't nothing to me ... but something to stand on .
MARSH : Let me hear your number , Dorothy .
Come on , Jerry .
The " Habit " number .
Jerry , put it up a half tone , will you ?
Doesn 't she sing gorgeous ?
Seventy thousand bucks .
Watch this , honey .
I may want you to understudy her .
All right , okay .
Come on , folks , get ready for the duet number . Start up .
Okay , Jerry , let 's go .
Come on , faster !
Faster , Jerry , faster !
What 's the matter with you ?
- You all right , kid ?
- I guess so .
ANDY : Come on , faster .
Faster !
WOMAN : Peggy ! - ANDY :
Stand back !
Get back in line . - LORRAINE :
She 's fainted .
Come on now , places .
This is a rehearsal , not a rest cue .
Mac , take her outside .
Hurry up .
Come on , everybody .
ANDY : All right , come on , get back .
Jerry , let 's go .
Come on , pick it up !
- Here , sir .
- Thank you .
- ANDY : Hold your places !
- Lawler , inside .
- The girl 's okay . - LAWLER :
You feel better , honey ?
I guess I fainted .
That 's a good guess .
Well , I guess I 'm all right now .
Bad guess .
Better sit down again .
Now listen , you let me play now .
What would you suggest , doctor ?
A little fresh air and conversation .
What about Mr. Marsh ?
Never mind Mr. Marsh .
Let 's sit this dance out .
And if I lose my job ?
If you do , there just won 't be any show .
Anyway , it 's a nice idea .
I 've got a lot of nice ideas .
What I need are ears to spill them in .
Well , won 't mine do ?
Yes , you know , I think they 'd do very , very nicely .
When are your ears available ?
At all sorts of odd hours .
You must look them up sometime .
Remind me to tell you you 're swell .
- MARSH : That 's all for tonight .
- ANDY : All right , dismissed , girls .
Well , thanks , doctor .
Your prescription was great .
Now for the workshop .
You gotta take it daily to really do any good .
It 'll have to be absent treatment , I 'm afraid .
At least for the time being .
- Good night , Jimmy .
- JIMMY : Good night .
Coming , Abner ?
Dorothy , where will we eat ?
You know , Abner , I 'm not a bit hungry .
- But I 'm all dressed for dinner .
- Oh , yes , so you are .
I 'll get the car .
- Dorothy , the car 's here .
- Yes , Abner .
Why , doctor , you must like it here .
I 'm beginning to .
I 'm not the doctor anymore , you are .
I 've become the patient , and I 'd like a little advice .
Very well , but you might tell the doctor your name .
I couldn 't do that , but my initials are Pat Denning .
What do you advise for a man who 's both hungry and lonesome ?
- Company .
- Excellent .
Did you have anyone in mind ?
- Did you ?
- Will you ?
- I 'm very much afraid I will .
- Good .
Good night , Pat .
It was a wonderful evening .
- I 'll see you again ?
- I hope so .
- Good .
- Good night .
MURPHY : Hey , got a match ?
Yep . I guess so .
Happen to know a guy named Pat Denning ?
- Why , yes .
- We 've got a message for him .
This guy Denning 's a pretty wise mug , but he ain 't wise enough . If he don 't lay off Dorothy Brock , it 'll be just too bad ... for Denning .
Get me ?
- I 'll tell him .
- Yeah , well ...
Oh ! - That 's so you don 't forget .
Who were they ?
- Friends with good advice .
- Are you hurt ?
Not much .
But , Pat , tell me what happened .
Better let it drop .
Besides , it 's hardly a bedtime story for a nice girl like you .
What do you think this is ?
Get that man out of here !
- But , Mrs. Holt ...
- But nothing !
I have eyes .
Just because there 's a depression on , some folks think I 'll stand for it .
But you don 't know .
After running a rooming house for 19 years , there 's nothing I don 't know .
Now you get out , and no more talk !
Then if he goes , I go too !
Probably I 'll be able to bear up under that blow too .
Well ... where do we go from here ?
- Hotel ?
- I suppose so .
But it 'll have to be inexpensive , as I only have a dollar and a half .
- Uh , what about my place ?
- Broke ?
Not exactly .
Not exactly flush either .
Then I guess it 's your place or a park bench .
Here you are .
That 's better .
Hand me your coat .
Make yourself comfortable .
Will you excuse me a minute ?
Rose-colored glasses .
Let 's see how the world looks .
- Okay , doctor .
- Here we go .
- Things beginning to look any better ?
- A little bit .
- Tired , aren 't you ?
- Dead tired .
And I feel just like beginning .
You hop , step and jump as many miles as I have today ... and you 'd be tired too .
Pat , what are you doing ?
Please put me down !
Please , Pat .
Please put me down .
Now you go right to sleep , youngster .
What you need is a good night 's rest .
Good night .
- Yes ? Will you hand me my bag , please ?
- Oh , which one ?
- That one .
- Here you are .
- Thank you .
- Good night .
What do you do when you 've got left feet like mine ?
- Just pick them up and lay them down .
- I 'm doing the best I can .
Get a load of the juvenile .
Didn 't know we had elephants in the show .
MARSH : Wait a minute , hold it !
Hold it , Jerry !
Some director 's gonna jail you for taking money under false pretenses .
You 're supposed to be a dancer !
You just need license plates to look like a Model T Ford .
They 've been going all night long ...
I 'll keep them here if it takes a week !
All right , get out !
- Take the last eight bars .
- Pick it up , Jerry .
Pick it up , Jerry .
- Hello , honey .
- Oh , Dot , how are you ?
Oh , tea for two .
Uh , yeah . Friend of mine dropped in .
- Love me ?
I wonder .
You 're not going to get serious on me , are you ?
- You leaving town ?
- Yeah . Stock job in ...
Philadelphia .
Oh , Pat , without telling me ?
Well , I thought it was the best way .
Maybe you 're right .
- Sit down , dear .
I want to talk to you . - Mm-hm .
I 've done a lot of thinking since the other night .
Pat , you know what 's wrong with me , or rather , with us ?
We 've grown too necessary to one another .
You 've been content in the shadows while I basked in the spotlight ... simply because it 's held us together .
- My success has been your failure .
- Well , dear ... my failure , as you put it , has been my happiness .
But , darling , you 're capable of such great things .
You 're not a quitter .
I 've only wanted to help , but I 've been hurting you instead .
I realize that now .
That 's why I came here this morning .
Pat . We 're not going to see each other for a long time .
No more doorways .
No more secret meetings .
You 're going out on your own and make a success .
You 're right , Dot .
But you know ... somehow , I can 't imagine going on without you .
Nor I without you ... but it 's got to be .
Yes , Dot .
It 's got to be .
And maybe , someday ... someplace ?
Maybe .
Bye , Pat .
Oh , Dot ...
I love you .
Me too .
ANDY : Up !
Up .
- How are you , Bluebeard ?
- Okay , just a touch of scarlet fever .
Oh , that 's fine .
Maybe it 'll develop into something serious .
The curtain 's just come down !
It 's the end !
Is this what you call a finale ?
What is this ?
Amateur night ?
Have we been rehearsing for five weeks , or did I dream it ?
The show 's ragged !
- What do you mean , the show 's ragged ?
- The numbers are ragged !
May I remind all you shining lights that ... this is the company that opens tomorrow night ?
I am in the right theater , am I not ?
This is the Pretty Lady company , isn 't it ?
The all-star show that ... opens in Philadelphia tomorrow night ?
- CROWD : Philadelphia ?
- ANDY :
MAC : Quiet !
Philadelphia , PA .
Yeah , and on Sundays , it 's P-U .
- ANDY :
Quiet ! - Quiet !
Julian ...
- ... you mean Atlantic City , don 't you ?
- I mean Philadelphia .
Train leaves at 1 p.m. , Penn Station .
Full dress rehearsal , 4 : 00 . Arch Street Theater .
But I don 't want to go to Philadelphia .
Who does ?
We couldn 't get the house at Atlantic City .
But why Philadelphia ?
Well , when you become stage director ... we 'll open in your apartment . But right now , it 's Philadelphia .
Of all the cities in the United States , he would pick Philadelphia .
ANDY : All right now , listen to me .
We open at the Arch Street Theater tomorrow night .
So this is Philadelphia !
Why don 't you stop that ? !
Peggy .
- Getting a kick out of it ?
- Of course , you ?
I don 't know .
Do you suppose anybody 'll even know I 'm in the show ?
I will .
Does it make any difference to you ?
Gee , Billy .
I 've been for you since that first day .
ANDY : Places , everybody .
- I 'll be seeing you . - Okay .
You won 't forget the modulation on the last eight bars .
- You forgot your handkerchief . - MARSH :
Go ahead . JERRY :
Call those timers , hold them .
- nice to the right people , you 'll get along .
When you walk downstage ... just give it a little life .
You know , sort of ...
Quiet !
Please !
Well , it 's ... not good , it 's not bad .
That 's all for tonight .
- Wait .
- Hold it !
Come back here , girls .
I want you all to take your minds off the show .
Get out and relax .
Forget it till 10 : 00 tomorrow morning .
I don 't know .
I think it 'll do .
But I want you to come back tomorrow ... to give the best performance that you ever gave in your lives .
Company dismissed .
- Dismissed , girls .
- Company dismissed !
ANDY : Go on out and have a good time .
You really was elegant , Miss Brock .
Pansy , did anyone telephone me ?
Phone ?
No , ma 'am .
Nobody at all .
- You 're sure ?
- I certainly is . Yes , ma 'am , Miss Brock .
- Have a little supper with me , huh ?
- I would have .
- But you thought of it too late .
- I 've been thinking of it all day .
Well , I 'm not a mind reader .
I 've got a date .
- Huh ? - I 'm free tomorrow night .
- Then it 's a date . - Okay .
- Don 't forget , now .
I gotta get the stuff for the party .
Do you mind ?
I 'll see you at the hotel , room 1061 , and make it snappy !
She says for you to wait .
She 'll be out in just a minute . Oh .
MAC : Good night , Mr. Marsh .
I said , " What is it ?
A duck ? "
Andy , you 're terrible .
You know any more ?
I 've got a lot more ...
MARSH : Andy ?
- Yes , sir ?
- Go on , yes man .
Papa give you liver .
Shut up .
This may be important .
Oh , it can 't be , darling .
He 's calling you .
SPEAKS SILENTLY : Hurry up !
Sit down , Andy .
Anything wrong , chief ?
Everything 's wrong , Andy .
No , you 're a great director , Mr. Marsh .
Maybe I was , but ... right now I 'm a sick man .
They told me I was sick when I started , but I started anyway .
Andy , I 'm going to finish , and I 'm gonna have a show .
I know what they 'll say . They 'll like it .
They 've got to .
" Marsh is a wizard .
He turns them out like clockwork .
The guy isn 't human . He 's a machine . "
Well , I 'm not a machine , Andy .
And for the first time , I 'm counting on someone else .
I 've got to .
I 'm counting on you .
And tomorrow night , we 're gonna give them a show .
The greatest show Julian Marsh ever put on .
What are you doing ?
Got a date tonight ?
No .
Come on home with me , will you ?
I 'm lonesome . Sure .
Taxi .
Pat !
What are you doing in Philadelphia ?
Got my passport and dropped over .
- Business or pleasure ?
- I don 't know yet , but it 's a job .
Say , what about one of those cozy midnight suppers one reads about ?
I 've been hoping you 'd come out .
- Oh , dear , I have a date .
- Well , break it .
- I 'd like to , but I can 't .
- Well , you can try .
It 's with the company and we open tomorrow .
I really should be on hand .
I understand .
Let me drive you to the main event .
All right .
Taxi .
Congress Hotel .
Forget something , Dorothy ?
Congress Hotel .
Oh , Abner .
Isn 't this car big enough for two ?
Move over .
You ain 't gonna have another spell , are you ?
I 'm tired .
Dress rehearsal is no picnic .
- A little party 'll do you good .
Don 't just being with me cheer you up ?
Oh , tremendously .
I 'm practically hysterical right now .
Oh , don 't be afraid of me .
I got strength .
I used to be the intercollegiate champion hop , skip and jumper .
- Come on now , hurry up .
- Here I come .
Give the little boy a big hand .
Right across your big mouth .
Please !
I tell you , I don 't even know my own strength .
Wait a minute .
Just look here .
Oh , you 're too , too divine .
Tomorrow you 've got to give a performance , not an exhibition .
Well , you 'd never know it from the manuscript .
I beg your pardon .
She 's right .
- Let 's dance .
- I don 't want to .
- Come on , I wanna dance .
- Stop mauling me .
Let me alone .
You 're not funny to me tonight .
- I 've got half a mind ...
- You 're telling me .
Do you wanna cramp your act ?
In a star , it 's temperament , but in a chorus girl , it 's just bad taste .
What is this , target practice ?
Why can 't you let me alone ?
Wisecracks , I 'm sick of them !
I 'm tired of you .
Tired of all of you , do you hear ?
Why , Dorothy .
You know , you better hop on your Kiddie Kar and go back to Cleveland .
Excuse me , it 's the tight shoes .
Shut up !
- Where are you going ?
- Maybe she needs me .
- Are you going to be a sucker for that ?
- Sucker !
You listen to me .
Seventy thousand dollars is a lot of money to pay for a pack of insults .
So you 've been calling me a sucker behind my back , eh ?
Well , I ain 't a sucker for anybody .
Dorothy don 't mean that to me !
If not for me , she wouldn 't have had a show to star in .
She better not try to give me the air now .
Now ...
So that 's it , is it ?
You small-town big shot .
- Now don 't start ...
- Shut up !
So I better not give you the air , eh ?
Well , that 's exactly what I 'm giving you right now .
Now get out of my room , you sucker !
Get out !
Try and make me !
- Don 't do that again !
- Get out !
Get out !
No place for anybody whose insurance ain 't paid .
WOMAN : Wait for me .
And the next time you come to a lady 's apartment , act like a lady .
Please !
- We 've located Mr. Denning for you .
Get him for me , will you ?
Oh , now what ?
- Hello , Dorothy .
- Hello , Pat ...
Pat , I can 't stand it any longer .
I 've gotta see you .
- Yes , but ...
- Please don 't ask me why .
Just come quickly , please .
All right , dear .
I 'll be right over .
Come in .
Sorry , Julian .
More trouble .
- What 's up ?
- Dorothy 's out of the show .
Definitely , once and for all , she 's out .
Well , let me have it .
What happened ?
She threw me out of her room .
That 's what .
Now you want to throw her out .
What is this ? A game ?
- You can 't do it .
- ABNER : Oh , no ?
Brock 's in my show and that 's final .
If Dorothy stays in ... this show don 't open tomorrow night . That 's final .
Why , you potbellied sap .
I resent that .
You 've sunk $ 70,000 already , and you 're gonna toss that away ... because of a dame ?
That 's my funeral , ain 't it ?
And the funeral of 200 other people :
chorus girls , boys , electricians .
You wouldn 't be that mean , would you ?
Well , I think she ought to apologize .
Why , of course she 'll apologize .
She 'll be sorry by morning .
I wish you wouldn 't take it like this .
Back in New York , they 're calling you " The Angel of Broadway . " No .
- Sure .
- Are they ?
Well ... I guess maybe I can overlook it , if she apologizes .
But it must be tonight .
That 's final .
What 's the matter ?
You don 't seem to be warming up at all .
Oh , don 't , Terry !
Please !
Come on , this is no way to act .
You 've got me wrong , Terry .
I 'm not acting .
I just don 't like to be pawed , that 's all .
Come here , honey .
Why , you don 't know ...
- MAN : Must have been a fuse .
- WOMAN : Yeah , a fuse named Charlie . ( LAUGHING )
Peggy ! Peggy !
MAN : Go get her , Terry !
Come on , let 's have another drink .
- TERRY :
Going down ? - No , sir .
Up .
If he cramps our show now ...
BARRY : We fixed him once before , and we can do it again . Let 's get Marsh .
- What ?
- Mr. Denning .
Is he here ?
- You know he is .
What do you want ?
- Mr. Denning .
Can 't leave him alone for five minutes , can you ?
Please , Miss Brock .
This is important .
What 's the matter ?
Oh , Pat , there 's going to be trouble .
I saw ... Oh ! So it 's " Pat " to him , but it 's " Mr. Denning " to me .
You bet there 's gonna be trouble .
- Let 's see what it 's about .
- I know what it 's about !
She 's been spying on us .
- Spying ?
I wasn 't spying ...
- You were !
You were peeking through the keyhole .
You were , because I saw you .
She 's jealous .
You want him , but you won 't get him !
- Wait a minute .
- Wait for what ?
More spying and double-crossing ?
- Let me go !
Let me ...
- Wait a minute .
- PEGGY :
Oh , Miss Brock ! - Dorothy ...
You pushed me , didn 't you ?
Dorothy , what 's the matter with you ?
Oh , Pat . - My ankle .
- What is it ?
My ankle .
- Get the house doctor right away . - All right .
Hello . Please send the house doctor to Miss Brock 's apartment .
Yes , thank you .
PAT : Get her shoes off , quick .
There , there , now .
PEGGY : Pat , it 's swelling .
( KNOCKING ) - Answer the door , it 's the doctor . - All right .
- You sent for me ?
- Yes , doctor . Right in there .
- PAT : Oh , doctor .
It 's her ankle .
- Which one ?
- A glass of water , please .
- Yes , doctor .
- Is your name Denning ? - Yeah .
I want to talk to you .
Where is she ?
- She 's had an accident .
She fell and twisted her ankle .
It may be a break .
What are you talking about ?
How bad is it ?
- Can 't tell definitely .
- Maybe it 's only a sprain .
Looks like a fracture .
Can 't tell till the x-rays are made .
- Will she be able to go on tomorrow ?
- DOCTOR :
Go on ? - She 's got the show tomorrow night !
- Not a chance .
She 's got to !
Do something , doctor !
Get her a pair of crutches .
- Don 't stand there gaping . - But ...
Oh , get out !
Get out !
- I still don 't know why you 're here .
- If it was your business , I 'd tell you .
A broken ankle , huh ?
It 's too bad it wasn 't her neck .
May I have your attention ?
- Quiet , quiet !
- ANDY : Quiet , please !
There 'll be no performance tonight .
Wait a minute .
Wait !
Our star , Miss Brock , has had an accident . She 's broken her ankle .
Don 't leave the theater until you 're dismissed .
Get that , Andy ?
Hold the company here for further instructions .
- Stick around , everybody .
- Don 't anybody leave the theater !
You gotta think of something , someone .
There must be some way out of this .
Dillon just phoned .
He 's got everything fixed .
- Up to and including Brock 's ankle .
- No , he 's going through with it .
He 's going through with what ?
He found someone to take Brock 's place , and he 's on his way here with her now .
- Where ?
- I don 't know .
BARRY : Come on , Marsh .
No such luck .
Now , there 's a Kiddie Kar I could really go for .
Anytime Annie .
Well , lay me low .
Your new leading lady , folks .
I guess I saved the day all right this time .
ANDY : We 'd better go in and talk it over with Marsh .
- You have a big investment in this show .
- You 're telling him ?
I appreciate your help , but she won 't do .
Sure !
She didn 't wanna do it at first , but I convinced her .
She 's all set .
Why , she 'll be sensational .
- How about letting me talk ?
- All right .
Let 's quit kidding , Mr. Marsh .
Abbie , all those things sounded swell at breakfast ... but I can 't carry this show .
I know that as well as you do .
I appreciate your honesty .
Swell , because you 've got somebody here who can carry your show .
A great little trouper .
Aren 't I capable of selecting my own cast ?
But you 'd never pick her .
I say she can swing it .
How can you lose ?
You gotta try her .
- Who is she ?
- Sawyer . - MARSH :
- Yes , Peggy Sawyer .
She can dance rings around Brock .
Your show 's half dancing .
She 'd kill them .
Nobody ever heard of her .
She 's a raw kid from the chorus .
Listen , I 've been waiting years for a chance like this ... and if I give it up to someone else , believe me , she 's gotta be good . - Send her in .
- Do you mean it ?
MARSH : Yes , send her in .
BARRY : Mac !
- Oh , Mac !
Here . - Andy !
- ANDY : Yes , sir .
- Get Sawyer .
- Yes , sir .
- The boss wants to see you .
- PEGGY :
Who , me ? Not your brother .
Come on .
- Lorraine , will you hold that ? - Go ahead .
Well , here she is .
Experience ?
Just this show , Mr. Marsh .
You know the songs and dances ?
Can you play the lead tonight ?
The lead ?
Sure , you can .
Don 't let him scare you .
I 'll give you a chance because I 've got to .
Andy , send Jerry in .
I 'll have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl .
Get out of here .
I don 't want anybody in for the next five hours .
- Good luck , honey .
- Come on , you .
Pick it up right after the number .
There 's your cue .
Speak . Jim , they didn 't tell me you were here .
It was grand of you to come .
No , it 's impossible .
Impossible .
You 're greeting the man you love .
Your entrance speech !
Make it mean something .
Put feeling into it !
Listen , like this :
" Jim , they didn 't tell me you were here .
It was grand of you to come . " Let me hear it .
Jim , they didn 't tell me you were here .
It was grand of you to come .
No , it won 't do .
Look , have you ever been in love ?
Did you ever have a man hold you in his arms and kiss you ?
Now you 're in the spirit of the thing .
You love this man .
Now , give it all you 've got .
Let me hear it .
Jim , they didn 't tell me you were here .
It was grand of you to come .
That 's better .
Let me hear it from the beginning .
Go over there and make your entrance again .
All right .
Jim , they didn 't tell me you were here .
It was grand of you to come .
I can 't !
I can 't ...
Look here .
You can 't , but you will .
Please , Mr. Marsh .
You want this chance or don 't you ?
- All right .
Let 's try it again . - All right .
All right , it 's fair , only fair .
( KNOCKING ) MARSH : Come in .
Only an hour before the curtain .
Okay , Jerry , that 's all .
You let me down , Sawyer , and I 'll ...
Come on , lie down and relax .
The wardrobe woman will have to come in to fit your costumes .
But rest all you can , because you 're definitely going on tonight .
Julian , how about it ?
All right , the show goes on .
Wardrobe , everybody .
Everybody , makeup .
- Oh , Billy .
- Hello . I brought some coffee .
You can use a little , huh ?
Oh , Billy , I 'm so excited , I think maybe I 'm dreaming .
Oh , no , you 're awake , all right .
Don 't worry about that .
Billy , what 's going to happen to me ?
You 'll be a hit .
You 'll be the biggest thing that ever hit Broadway .
Oh , I hope so .
Say , I know so .
And I 'm for you too .
You know that .
Even if ...
Even if what ?
Oh , honey .
I 've been for you ever since the day you walked in on me in my BVDs .
I wanted to tell you , ever since I first saw you , how I feel about you .
Oh , I don 't know how to say it .
But you know what I mean , don 't you ?
I guess it does sound kind of funny at that , the way I say it .
But the lines are new for me , at least off-stage .
Well , I guess maybe I can read between the lines , Billy ... but I wanna hear you say some more .
Billy , it was grand of you to come .
- They told me I 'd find you here .
- Miss Brock ! You can 't talk to her , nobody can .
It 's Marsh 's orders .
I wanna see her alone .
I know , but ...
It 's all right , Billy .
So you 're going to take my place .
I 'm sorry , Miss Brock .
You 're nervous , aren 't you ?
Well , don 't be .
The customers out there want to like you .
Always remember that , kid .
I 've learned it from experience .
And you 've got so much to give them :
Youth and beauty and freshness .
Do you know your lines ?
And your songs ?
And your dance routine ?
Well , you 're a cinch .
But ... But it 's tough on you , Miss Brock .
Come here .
Peggy , isn 't it ?
You know , Peggy , when I started for the theater tonight ... I wanted to tear your hair out .
And then I started thinking .
Well , after all , I 've had my chance .
And now it 's your turn .
I 've had enough .
For five years it 's kept me away from the only thing I ever wanted .
And a funny thing ... a broken ankle was the thing that made me find it out .
You know , Peggy , most anyone can have success with the proper breaks .
As for me ... I 'll take Pat and vaudeville ... or whatever goes with him .
We 're being married tomorrow .
Oh , I 'm so glad .
( KNOCKING ) Come in .
You 've gotta hurry , miss .
Come right in , boys .
Right over here .
MAC : Overture , places , girls !
I think it looks very nice now .
Do I look all right ?
You look adorable .
Now , go out there and be so swell that you 'll make me hate you .
PEGGY : Thanks .
Remember , girls , I want a straight line all the way through .
Marguerite , you 're first .
Give me a big smile .
Get ready .
All right , curtain .
Come on , all right . Get Sawyer .
When she comes out , I don 't want any of you to say a word to her .
Here she comes .
All right , break up .
Pay no attention to her .
Sawyer , you listen to me , and you listen hard .
Two hundred people , 200 jobs ... $ 200,000 , five weeks of grind , blood and sweat depend upon you .
The lives of these people who 've worked with you .
You 've got to go on and give and give and give .
They 've got to like you , understand ?
You can 't fall down , because ... your future , my future and all we have is staked on you .
Now I 'm through .
Keep your feet on the ground , your head on your shoulders ... and go out .
Sawyer , you 're going out a youngster ... but you 've got to come back a star .
- There she is .
- There 's your cue . ANDY : Good luck , honey .
Well , honey , we couldn 't lose them , and least of all , Jimmy .
Why , Jim , they didn 't tell me you were here .
It was grand of you to come .
MAN : All aboard the Niagara Limited !
Come on , let 's go !
That 's your light change .
All right , snap into it .
Hurry up , kids . Get going .
Take it away !
Break this up .
Come here . You got by , but you 're not through yet .
The toughest part 's coming .
Don 't be a flash in the pan .
There isn 't an actor here who doesn 't know what you 're going through .
Now you gotta rest .
Rest and relax .
Save it , because you 're gonna need it .
I 've been watching you for a couple weeks .
If you 're nice to the right people , you 'll get along .
- You know these routines ?
- Quiet , please .
Mike , dim those first three borders , will you ?
Hurry up . ANDY : Places , everybody , for the finale .
She 's a hit , Abner .
She 's a hit !
Who 's a hit ? Peggy Sawyer .
- Oh . - Did you do as I told you ?
- Oh , no , I didn 't .
- Well ... But I 'll take her right out .
Come on , Fifi .
Well , hurry .
Directors make me sick .
Take Marsh . Name all over the program , gets all the credit .
If it wasn 't for Sawyer , he wouldn 't have a show .
She 'll have Broadway in her pocket in a week .
- WOMAN : You 're right . - MAN :
Marsh will say he discovered her . Some guys get all the breaks .

You all did .
You have been beaten ! And why ?
Because you have hunger !
You have muscles like athletes , and you only look at that what 's all in the shops .

Then you are doing good Mr.
The paper is forbearance and me too .
Please .
You are a vivacity boy .
Here .
Thank you !
See you . How much did he give to you ?
One Mark . That 's actually my money .
Why ?
Because he drove a bargain .
Go home now .
Don 't waste all that money .
You look ok .
My head still spins . Drink glass water .
Until when do I drink water ?
I want a bottle of pale ale .
Do you have money ?
Yes , of curse . Wait a minute .
Mother give me a few pennies .

A ache ?

You ironed the bed-linen !
I have to bring it back first . Don 't abash .
You will have a few pennies .
My god !
You have hidden it again ?
I 'll find it .
Let it be , father . You will smash everything again .
If I want to drink one then I want to drink one . Understand ? !
You have hidden it in the living room , what ?

Where is the money ? I don 't have it .
Leave the album .
Men don 't make any circus here .

If you won 't give something right now , then you will see ! Then something happens , understand ?
Give it to me !

Why couldn 't you give it before ? See you have to show only teeth to a woman .
Hey , you have a pretty decent son . Of curse .
Is he organized ?
No , not yet . What 's your name ?
Heini .
Are you a member ?
A member of what ?
You are am member ?
I 'm no member .
Then its time to belong to us to the Communist International Youth .
I 'm a bigwig there .
Or do you want to the Nazis ?
You make jokes man ...
My son and a Nazi ...
He is my son !
Let 's go .
We will talk again , Heini .
See you . That is not al life .
I won 't stand this any longer .
Mother , don 't be so sad all the time . Let me be .
Mother don 't you have one penny ? Why do you need one penny ?
There on the circus is a knife a universal pocketknife .
It has eight blades .
One saw , one screwdriver , one drill , one clippers .
You haven 't seen such a thing in your life .
A real thing , mother .
It sure cost a lot .
No mother , it 's in the lottery .
And to take part in it you need only one penny .
But I would need that one penny .
Yes ...
Here 's one penny .
Mother , I bet I 'm winning it .
I will win it for sure !
Whose not risking doesn 't win !
People buy only one lottery !
Every second lottery wins !
Every second one is a win !
Ladies and gentleman by me you have only to marry . Everything else I will get from me .
Here you can win . The lottery will start in 30 seconds .

The little man means that knife ? Yes How much is it ?
Eight Marks !

Don 't give up .
I will get you that knife . Have you thought on joining that organization ?

You shall remember this . We are going to the beach tomorrow .

No , it costs nothing . I 'll come soon .
Will you go by rail ?
Yes of curse .
And you will camp too ? Yes .

Come today 21 a clock to Bolzsestrasse 56 .
There we celebrate the opening of our new home . A real home ?

It 's just a old basement but its comfortably furnished .
Bolzsestrasse ?
There are a lot of communists . Exactly because of that .
And if I can 't get out of home ?
Try .
You can tell a lot .
Yes . I 'll come !
Before we can take the boy to the Kommunistische Jugend-Internationale we need jour signature . My signature ? Why my signature ?
You have to agree as a father . Here sign .
Don 't you want to ask the boy first ? if he wants to ? What means if he wants ?

The boy wants .
You can be happy if he is accepted .
That could be his luck .
Here , Völker .
What did Stoppel want here ?
He was by your father .
What did he want ?
Father will tell you .
Go into the living room . Stoppel wanted that you go to the party pub about 21 a clock .
What I 'm doing there ?
You will see when you get there .
Do I get the house key then ?
Of curse you are getting into the party now .
Then you are a adult .
A adult man , and a adult has the house key .
Come here .
Sit .
I wanted to talk to you .
Today is a lot happening what you don 't understand .
But we workers have to keep together .
Look at how we live .
Your mother , I and you .
That wasn 't always so .
We had also our better days .
But a lot has got worse .
I would like to have done more for you .
I have thought on that in a lot of nights I could have let you become something better .
But years without work and salary . That ties one into knots . And now you young boys have to help us .
You have to stay beside us old .
Otherwise we will not make it .
Otherwise we will get forth unemployment benefit . Do you understand ?
Yes , father .
Here is the house key .
Your father wants only good for you my son .
Now go , look that you get to your party .
Was it very terrible ?
Father isn 't so bad .
Father is totally different .
What do I do now ?
He gave me the house key .
Now I can 't lie to him anymore .
What do I do ?
Tell me mother .
It would be better if you would listen to your father .
But I cant ! One cans everything , Heini .
You have to try .
In life anything can 't be like you wish .
I don 't wan to go to the communists .
I want to the others .
Already today is one new comer .
Who ?
The boy who was by our camp on the solstice . That is good .
We will be so many that the house will shake . I 'll hope you like it by us .
And if you need something knock on the door above .
Thank you Madame . Good evening !
You have done it fine , that 's the best place in Beusselkiez .

That booth has to be emptied ?
You will go to Volkovski corner .
Emil , Zwingli corner . Franz you go to Levezoo corner .

Hey , come here !
I can 't leave here .
I 'm on duty . Come ! I can 't .
Where are you going ?
Alarm !
Alarm !
You are all arrested !
You provoke the people .
If you hadn 't opened the gathering place there then no riot would have started . The thief stole an clock from the clock store .
And you Mr. Commissar are arresting the clockmaker because he provoked the thief to steal .
Why provoked ? He did put the clock into the display window .
You have learned that well .
Look that you 'll get home . We have the names .
Now bring the red here .
Go now .
What 's your name ? Can 't you speak ?
Tell me what 's your name ?
I don 't want to do that . Sit boy .
Why won 't you tell me what 's your name ?
I fear that my name goes into the newspaper .
Yes , you should have thought on that earlier . I have nothing to too with all this .
We caught him right at there .
I just walked by there . So ?
Where did you want to go ?
At home .
You don 't look really like a gunslinger .
So go home to your mother . What are you doing here ?
We are going . Go now !
Go !
Ah you are the red ! No I 'm not !
You sent the commune on us !
Now we know , you spy !
Are you alone ?
Yes .
Is the adept here ?
No , he is already gone .
Do it fast here .
I count on you tonight .
Why with me ?
Because you did well last time .
You didn 't tell the police anything .
My respect .
I will need today men like this .
What 's going on tonight ? Tonight is done good work .
Do you know the fabric on Marx Street ?
Yes .
There we have our goodies .
Goodies ?
Yes , goodies .
Everything that belongs to a good household : A little dynamite , few rounds , a few rifles .
What ? What ...
You understand ? Understand what ?
We have a little payoff with the Nazis .
That with the HJ-basement was a small thing .
You want to attack the boys ? Attack , what words .
With rifles !
You notice everything ! You can 't do that !
Do what ?
I don 't want that you are doing it !
Don 't laugh !
I mean it seriously .
What does your seriously mean ? I 'll do something !
What do you do ?
I will warn the boys !
So ? Listen boy !
You can do that only once .
Understand ? One time only .
Then I do it that one time !
Boy , you are right . See you .

Do you hear me ?
They have dynamite .
They have something planed against you .
Ulla , listen !
They have rifles and dynamite .
Ulla , dynamite .
Hang up . Did you understand me ?
Ulla , do you hear ?
Did you understand me ?
Let 's go .
he said dynamite . Ah that 's some trick .
Some trap .
Fritz , I don 't know .
You have to do something . Ah what .
We have to do something , maybe that 's true .
Nothing of that is true ! That is rubbish .
It 's deceit nothing more .
But the boys !
My constables aren 't babysitters for the Hitler-Youth .
It would be better if you stayed at home and do your homework .
I don 't see any reason to react . I want to speak to Odoil .
The Herr isn 't at home . I mean Fritz , Fritz Odoil .
Ah Herr Fritz and Miss Ulla left 30 minutes ago .
Left where ?
Where here a boy and a girl together ?
I haven 't seen them .
Hot wieners !
Hot wieners !
You have to search yourself .
Hot wieners !
Here you go Miss .
Rich people want to travel .
That fore the travel by train .
But the train can derail .
But the guard keeps watch .
But some times it happens ...
With a knife you can stab .
And who bleeds is getting red .
That is called a crime , who 's the victim is dead .
And he lies in the puddle .
But some times it happens ... That was on Marx Street !
Marx Street ?
Where do you want to go ?
Into the pub !
What do you want there ? I must get know what happened in Marx Street .
Why are you so upset ?

Put the light out !
What are you steering at me like that ?
Are you been followed ?
Yes .
From who ?
From the homicide division .
That fare we aren 't yet .
Could you do something like that ?
Like what ?
Kill a man . A interesting question .
Depends on the circumstances .
When someone is betraying me then I will finish him .
That 's no case for the homicide division . That 's a law of nature .
Sins when do you limp ?
Since someone did betray me .
By the police ?
No , by the Nazis .
By the Nazis ? Yes Nazis .
Where is your Heini ?
You have done something to him !
Don 't talk rubbish !
I haven 't done nothing to him !
Here what ?
You have to learn that .
Such a bad scene ...
You should be lucky that you aren 't Heini .
It wasn 't someone from us . Who then ?
Maybe some stupid kid .
You did that Heini .
Yes , mother . I saved the boys .
Why are you crying mother ? You will see now .
Everything gets ok now .
My son now everything will be ok .

Pleas . Get along with him .
Otherwise everything is over .
But mother , everything begins now .
We have to do only one thing .
We must finish the boy .

The boy needs a good beating .
When he does something stupid .
We don 't do such a gentle thing .
The boy isn 't your concern , understand ?
Did you rest well ?
We did it nurse . Am I sick ?
You inhaled gas .
The pipework wasn 't ok at your home .
Now you have to eat a lot .

I went to the see . I wanted to become a sailor .
There where islands , palms , Africa .
Thousands of boys have left their homes .
That where rascals . You ...
The boys are a mystery .
It has always been like that . They have gone to the fur trappers , to the gypsies .
Every time the big call has called them .
Then began their journey . Where does a boy belong ?
Ask your son .
Say something !
I don 't know if you where in the war .
Of curse . Two million boys did go as volunteers .
All of them where the sons of fathers and mostly of mothers .
Where did they belong ?
I was a simple man .
I 'm a worker .
But you have hearted from the movement ?

Until I got shot .
Then they putted me in gypsum .
Then I got again movement . Stretch my bones .
Awry direct .
Awry direct .

Week for week. year for year .
that was my movement . After that nothing moved me .
I was clapped out .
Do you think I am that fad from eating ?
No ! Because I have no work !
I am fad because I 'm sitting around ! Where do I belong ! ?
I belong to my fellows of the workers class .
And where I belong , belongs also the boy . To your workers class fellows ?

Say , is this the moving-picture ship ?
The Venture ?
Yeah .
- Are you going on this crazy voyage ?
- What 's crazy about it ?
I don 't know .
But everybody is talking about that crazy fella running it .
- Carl Denham ?
- Guess that 's the name .
He ain 't scared of nothing .
If he wants a picture of lion he just goes up to him and tells him to look pleasant .
He 's a tough egg .
Why all this talk about this voyage being crazy ?
Everybody around the docks is talking about the cargo , for one thing .
And I never did see a ship this size with such a crew .
- Not enough men to handle her ?
- Not enough !
Three times more than the ship needs .
I don 't see where they 're gonna have room enough to sleep .
Hey , down there .
What do you want ?
- Denham aboard ?
- Who are you ?
My name is Weston , the theatrical agent .
Well , why didn 't you say so ?
Come on aboard .
Denham 's getting wild .
I hope you 've got some good news for him .
Well , Mr. Denham , you know the reasons for hurrying as well as I do .
Insurance company found out we 're carrying explosives .
Marshal will be aboard tomorrow or next day .
If we make a legal case of it , we 'll be tied up for months ?
With enough ammunition to blow up the harbor .
What do you think the marshal will say to these new gas bombs of yours ?
According to you , one of them is enough to knock out an elephant .
We 've got to get where we 're going before the monsoon starts .
- Trust me to see you through a blow .
- Oh , now , don 't get sore , skipper .
You can 't run into the rainy season when you 're trying to make an outdoor picture .
Months wasted , money gone and nothing to show .
Still you always bring back a picture .
And everybody says , " There 's only one Carl Denham . "
Weston , I was just going ashore to call you .
If I 'd known that , I would have waited .
This is the skipper .
Weston , the theatrical agent .
I guess you met Driscoll , the first mate .
Well , Weston , how about the girl ?
- It can 't be done , Denham .
- What ?
It 's got to be done .
Now , look here , Weston .
Somebody 's interfered with every girl I try to hire .
Now all the agents in town have shut down on me . All but you .
- You know I 'm square .
- Everybody knows you 're square .
But you 've got a reputation for recklessness that can 't be glossed over . Then you 're so secretive . You said it .
Even skipper and mate don 't know where they 're going , what .
There you are .
I 've got a conscience , Denham .
I can 't send a pretty girl such as you ask on a job like this without telling her what to expect .
- What is she to expect ?
To go off on a trip for no one knows how long to some spot you don 't even hint at the only woman on a ship with the toughest mugs I ever looked at .
I mean the crew .
Good Lord , you talk as if I never brought anybody back alive .
The skipper and Driscoll have stuck to me on two trips .
- They look well enough .
- Sure , we 're healthy .
But it 's a different thing taking a girl into danger .
I suppose there 's no danger in New York .
Listen , there are dozens of girls in this town that are in more danger than they are with me .
Yeah , but they know that kind of danger .
You never had a woman in any of your pictures .
- Why do you want one ?
- Holy mackerel !
Do you think I wanna haul a woman around ?
- Then why ?
- Because the public , bless them must have a pretty face .
Sure , everybody likes romance .
Isn 't there any romance or adventure without having a flapper in it ?
Well , Mr. Denham , why not take a picture in a monastery ?
Makes me sore . I go out , sweat blood to make a swell picture then the critics and the exhibitors all say :
" If this picture had love interest , it would gross twice as much . "
The public wants a girl , and this time I 'm gonna give what they want .
- Don 't know where you 'll get her .
- I 've gotta get her , Weston .
We 've gotta leave by morning .
- We 've gotta be gone by daylight .
- Why ?
Well , there 's a good reason .
Everything I hear about it makes me like it less .
I 'm glad I didn 't get you a girl .
You are , eh ?
Well , I 'll show you .
Do you think I 'm gonna give up because you can 't find me a girl ?
I 'm going to make the greatest picture in the world .
Something that nobody 's ever seen or heard of .
They 'll have to think up a lot of new adjectives when I come back .
- Where you going ?
- Going out and get a girl for my picture .
Even if I have to marry one .
- Stand aside , please .
Get your case later .
- Can I take my things ?
Say , lay off the shoving , will you ?
- Oh , I didn 't mean to shove you .
- Excuse me .
What do they give you in this joint ?
Soup tonight . Coffee and sinkers in the morning .
I catch you , you stealer .
Now , I get you cop .
You like that , huh ?
No , no . I didn 't . Let me go .
I wanted to , but I didn 't .
- Had enough of these stealers .
- Dry up .
Kid didn 't take any .
- Truly I didn 't .
- Three people this week ...
- Here ...
Here 's a buck .
- A buck .
Scram .
Hey , taxi !
Feeling better ?
Yes , thank you .
- You 're very kind .
- Don 't you fool yourself .
I 'm not bothering about you just out of kindness .
- How 'd you ever get into this fix ?
- Bad luck , I guess .
There are a lot of girls like me .
- Not many with your looks .
- I can get by in good clothes all right .
- But when a girl gets too shabby ...
- No family ?
Supposed to have an uncle someplace .
Did you ever do any acting ?
I used to do extra work now and then over on Long Island .
The studio 's closed now .
- What 's your name ?
- Ann Darrow .
Fine . I 've got a job for you .
Costumes on the ship will fit you .
If the shops are still open , I can get clothes for you .
- Come on .
- But ...
- But what is it ?
- It 's money and adventure and fame .
It 's the thrill of a lifetime . A long sea voyage that starts at 6 : 00 tomorrow morning .
No , wait .
I don 't understand .
You must tell me .
I do want the job so but I can 't .
No , you 've got me wrong .
This is strictly business .
- I only wanted ...
- Sure . Sure you did .
I got a little excited and I forgot you didn 't understand .
Listen , I 'm Carl Denham .
Ever heard of me ?
Yes , yes .
You make moving pictures in jungles and places .
That 's right .
And I pick you as lead in my next picture .
We sail at 6 .
- Where to ?
- A long way off .
And listen , Ann , I 'm on the level .
No funny business .
- What do I have to do ?
- Just trust me and keep your chin up .
Hey , you men on that winch down below on the deck and help with these hatches .
Hurry this line forward .
Forward , you farmer and up here !
What are you doing up here ?
- I just wanted to see .
- Oh , you just wanted to see .
Well , I 'm sorry .
Make that line fast !
You 're that girl Denham picked , aren 't you ?
Yes .
I think this is awfully exciting .
I 've never been on a ship before .
I 've never been on one with a woman before .
I guess you don 't think much of women on ships ?
No , they 're a nuisance .
- I 'll try not to be .
- You 've been in the way already .
Bring that ladder aboard !
Well , you better stay below .
What ?
The whole voyage ?
I 'm afraid I didn 't apologize for hitting you .
That was a pretty tough rap on the chin .
- Well , we 're off .
- We 're off .
Say , how many potatoes do you think you 've peeled in six weeks ?
Too many .
Sailors eat an awful lot , don 't they ?
All time eat .
Someday me go back China .
Never see no more potatoes .
- Charlie , isn 't the ocean wonderful ?
- Very pretty .
Pretty soon you be all same sailor , only no eat so much .
I 'd like to be .
Only , of course , it wasn 't so nice up north when it was cold and rough was it ?
Ocean very nice when you order weather or some eggs for breakfast .
- Hello , Ann .
- Hello , Jack .
Where you been all morning ?
Trying on costumes for Mr. Denham .
He 's gonna make some tests of me here on deck if the light is right .
- Tests , why ?
Oh , to see which side of my face looks best and all that .
Both sides look all right to me .
Yes , but you 're not the movie director .
If I was , you wouldn 't be here .
Well , is that a nice thing to say .
This is no place for a girl .
You can 't say I 've been one bit of trouble to anyone have I ? I wish you wouldn 't keep harping on that .
It 's very mean of you .
Anybody would think I 'd been a lot of trouble .
I haven 't .
- Sure you have . Sure you have .
- I don 't see ...
Well , how ?
Just ... Just being around is trouble .
Oh , dear , and I thought everything was going so nicely .
Oh , you 're all right .
But women just can 't help being a bother .
- Made that way I guess .
- Well , anyhow ...
I 've had the happiest time of my life on this old ship .
That 's ... That 's fine .
Say ...
Did you really mean that , Ann ?
Of course .
Everyone 's so nice to me .
Dr. Denham and the skipper ...
Don 't you think the skipper is a sweet old lamb ?
I 'd hate to have him hear me say that .
Iggy 's nice to me .
Iggy likes me better than he likes anybody onboard .
Don 't you , Iggy ?
- That 's right .
Of course you do . - Beauty and the beast , eh ?
Well , now , I never thought I was good-Iooking .
Put on one of the costumes .
The light 's right for those tests now .
All right , Mr. Denham .
I won 't be a minute .
Beauty and the beast .
Mr. Denham I 'm gonna do some butting in .
- What 's your trouble ?
- When do we find out where we 're going ?
- Pretty soon .
Will you tell us what happens after ?
How can I ? I 'm not a fortuneteller .
You must have some idea what you 're after .
What 's the matter ?
You going soft .
Oh , you know I 'm not .
Not for myself .
- For Ann .
- Oh , you have gone soft on her , eh ?
I 've got enough troubles without a love affair to complicate things .
- Better cut it out , Jack .
- Love affair .
- Think I 'm gonna fall for any dame ?
- I never knew it to fail .
Some big hard-boiled egg gets a look at a pretty face , bang he cracks up , gets sappy .
- Who 's going sappy ?
I haven 't run out on you ?
No .
You 're a pretty tough guy .
But if beauty gets you , you ...
I 'm going right into a theme song here .
- Say , what are you talking about ?
- It 's the idea of my picture .
The beast was a tough guy too .
He could lick the world , but when he saw beauty , she got him .
He went soft , he forgot his wisdom and the little fellas licked him .
Think it over , Jack .
Mr. Denham , skipper wants you up on the bridge .
- He says we 've reached the position .
- Good .
Come on , Jack .
You 're in on this .
I 'm gonna spill it .
There 's our noon position .
Two south , 90 east .
Now , you promised some information when we got here .
- Way west of Sumatra .
- And way out of any waters I know .
I know the East Indies like I do my own hand but I 've never been here .
- Where do we go from here ?
- Southwest .
- Southwest ?
Well , there is nothing for thousands of miles .
Keep your shirt on , skipper . We 're not going thousands of miles .
Here 's the island we 're looking for .
Well , that position .
Let 's have the big chart .
You won 't find that island on any chart .
That was made by the skipper of a Norwegian bark .
- He must have been kidding .
- No , he wasn 't .
Listen , a canoe full of natives from this island was blown to sea .
When the bark picked them , there was one alive .
He died before they reached port , not before the skipper had a description of the island and got an idea of where it lies .
- Where did you get it ?
- Singapore , two years ago .
Skipper knew I 'd be interested .
- Does he believe it ?
- I don 't know .
But I do .
Here . Here 's what the island looks like .
There 's a long , sandy peninsula .
The only possible landing place is through this reef .
Rest of shoreline 's sheer precipice , hundreds of feet high .
And across the base of the peninsula , cutting it off from the rest of the island , is a wall .
- A wall ?
- Built long ago .
People who lived there slipped back , forgotten the high civilization that built it .
That wall is as strong today as it was centuries ago .
The natives keep that wall in repair .
- They need it .
- Why ?
There 's something on the other side of it . Something they fear .
A hostile tribe .
Did you ever hear of Kong ?
Why , yes .
Some native superstition , isn 't it ?
A god or a spirit or something .
Well , anyway , neither beast nor man something monstrous , all-powerful .
Still living still holding that island in a grip of deadly fear .
Well , every legend has a basis of truth .
I tell you , there 's something on that island that no white man has ever seen .
- And you expect to photograph it ?
- If it 's there , you bet I 'll photograph it .
Suppose it doesn 't like having its picture taken ?
Well , now you know why I brought along those cases of gas bombs .
Oh , you 've put on a beauty-and-beast costume , eh ?
It 's the prettiest .
All right . Just stand right over there .
I 'm sort of nervous .
Suppose I don 't photograph well ?
You don 't have to worry about that .
If I hadn 't been sure I wouldn 't have brought you around the world .
- What will I do ?
- Well , we start with the profile .
When I start cranking why , hold it a minute , and then turn slowly toward me .
You see me . You smile a little , then you listen .
Then you laugh .
All right .
Camera .
- Looks kind of silly , don 't it ?
- Pretty dame , huh ?
You think maybe he like to take my picture ?
Them cameras cost money .
Shouldn 't think he 'd risk it .
Now , that 's fine , Ann .
Now we 'll try one with a filter , eh ?
Do you always take the pictures yourself ?
Ever since a trip I made to Africa .
I 'd have got a swell picture of a charging rhino but the cameraman got scared .
The darned fool .
I was right there with a rifle .
Seems he didn 't trust me to get the rhino before it got him .
I haven 't fooled with a cameramen since .
I do it myself .
- Think he 's crazy , skipper ?
- Just enthusiastic .
Ann , in this one you 're looking down . When I start to crank , you look up slowly .
You 're quite calm . You don 't expect to see a thing .
Then you just follow my directions . All right ?
Camera .
Look up slowly , Ann .
That 's it .
You don 't see anything .
Now look higher still higher .
Now you see it .
You 're amazed .
You can 't believe it .
Your eyes open wider .
It 's horrible , Ann , but you can 't look away .
There 's no chance for you , Ann , no escape .
You 're helpless , Ann , helpless .
There 's just one chance , if you can scream but your throat 's paralyzed . Try to scream , Ann , try .
Perhaps if you didn 't see it , you could scream .
Throw your arm across your eyes and scream . Scream for your life .
What 's he think she 's really gonna see ?
This infernal fog .
Sure of your position , skipper ?
Last night before this fog shut down , I got a good sight .
We should be near the island .
If we don 't see it when this fog lifts , we never will .
We 've quartered these parts .
Can 't see your hand in front of your face .
Hey , Charlie , I wish you 'd make your soup as thick as this .
No bottom at 30 .
The Norwegian skipper must 've been guessing at the position .
How will we know it 's the right island ?
- The mountain that looks like a skull .
- Oh , yes , I 'd forgotten . You told me .
- Skull Mountain .
- By the deep 20 .
Shallowing fast .
Mr. Briggs , dead slow .
Dead slow , sir .
- Confound this fog .
- By the deep 16 .
- What 'd she draw , skipper ?
- Four .
Why don 't he heave to until it clears ?
'Tain 't the old man .
It 's that crazy guy , Denham .
Listen , you hear anything ?
No .
- Breakers ahead .
- Let go .
That 's not breakers .
That 's drums .
Skipper , now the fog 's lifted , do you see anybody ?
- Not a living thing .
- Funny they haven 't spotted us .
I 'd think the whole population would be on the beach .
Listen .
Maybe they have spotted us and are signaling .
Well , skipper , do you believe me now ?
There it is .
Skull Mountain , the wall .
Everything just like on my funny little map .
- Come on . Let 's get started .
- All right .
Twelve men go with you .
The rest stay aboard .
Have you got a good man with those gas bombs ?
I think you better go along .
You may be able to talk to these birds .
All right .
Mr. Adams .
Aye , sir .
- You 'll take charge of the ship .
- Aye , aye , sir .
- I 'm going ashore with you , aren 't I ?
- You bet .
I don 't think she should until we know what 's there .
Wait a minute .
Who 's running this show ?
I found out from experience to keep my cast and cameras with me .
You never can tell when you 'll want them .
- But you 're crazy to risk ...
- Jack run along and get the rifles and ammunition .
And get me a couple of huskies to carry my stuff .
And , Jack , don 't forget the costume box .
If we 're lucky enough , we may get a swell shot right away .
Come on , Ann .
All right , boys , let 's go .
- Take it easy with that camera .
- Okay .
- Plenty of ammunition for those guns ?
Be careful with those bombs .
All right , Briggs , now we 'll get a look at Denham 's island .
Stand by to lower away .
You with the camera , stick close .
- Okay .
- Who 's got the bombs ?
- I have , sir .
- Watch your step .
There 's enough trichloride to put hippos to sleep .
Aye , aye , sir .
- What queer-Iooking boats .
- Yeah , outrigger canoes .
Driscoll , I want two men left here to guard the boat .
- All attended to , sir .
- Good .
We all ready , then ?
Come on .
Not a soul in sight .
The people must all be gathered up ahead .
That wall , skipper . What do you think of that ?
Colossal .
It might almost be Egyptian .
But what 's on the other side of that wall ? I wanna know .
Who do you suppose could have built it ?
Oh , I was up on Angkor once .
That 's bigger than this , and nobody knows who built it .
Oh , boy , what a chance .
What a picture .
Come on .
Hear that ?
They 're saying , " Kong , Kong . "
Hope you talk their lingo , skipper .
- You catch any words yet ?
- I 'm not sure .
Sounds something like the language Nias Islanders speak .
What do you suppose is happening ?
They 're up to some of their heathen tricks .
But don 't go rushing out to sea .
- All right .
But isn 't it exciting ?
- Sure .
- I wish we 'd left you on the ship .
- Oh , I 'm so glad you didn 't .
Wait . Easy , now .
Wait till I see what goes on .
Holy mackerel !
What a show .
Hey , skipper , come here and get a load of this .
Did you ever see anything like that before in your life ?
Boy , if I could only get a picture before they see us .
Hey , you with the camera .
Come here .
I wanna see .
Come on , but be careful .
- Too late .
They see us .
- Let 's ... Let 's beat it .
- Hey , what are you running for ?
- No use trying to hide now .
Everybody come out in plain sight .
- Say , let 's scram out of here .
- Stand still , you fool .
Steady , boys , bluff them .
Come on , skipper . Make him a friendly speech .
He understands you , skipper .
What 's he say ?
- He 's telling us to get out .
- Well , talk him out of it .
Ask him what goes on .
He says the girl there is the bride of Kong .
Great .
Find out what they 're gonna do .
- What 's that ?
- He must be the witch doctor .
He says the ceremony is spoiled because we 've seen it .
Well , calm the old boy down .
What 's the word for friend ?
Steady with those rifles , boys .
- What 's that ?
- He says , look at the golden woman .
Yeah . Blonds are scarce around here .
- A gift for Kong , he says .
- Good Lord !
Wants to buy her .
He 's offering to trade six of his women for Ann .
You got her into this , Denham .
I 'm gonna take her back to the ship .
We 'd better get out of here before they think to cut us off .
Guess so . But tell him we 'll be back tomorrow to make friends .
Get going , Ann .
Don 't be scared .
Everything 's all right .
Smile , Ann , and talk to Jack .
Keep your chin up .
- Say , why aren 't you in bed ?
- Oh , I can 't sleep .
The sound of those drums makes me nervous , I guess .
I think Denham 's off his nut taking you ashore today .
Well , I was a little scared .
- I guess you weren 't the only one .
- I wonder what we do next .
That 's just what 's worrying me .
Denham 's a fool , there 's no telling what he might ask you to do for this picture .
After all he 's done , I would take any chance for him .
Don 't talk like that .
I 'd say he 's crazy enough to try anything .
Well , I won 't go back on him .
When I think of what might 've happened today , if anything had happened to you ...
Then you wouldn 't be bothered having a woman onboard .
Don 't laugh .
I 'm scared for you .
I 'm sort of ...
Well , I 'm scared of you too .
Ann ...
I ...
Say ...
I guess I love you .
Why , Jack , you hate women .
Yeah , I know .
But you aren 't women .
Say , Ann ...
I don 't suppose ...
I mean ...
Well , you don 't feel anything like that about me do you ?
Mr. Driscoll , are you on deck ?
Yes , sir .
Will you please come up on the bridge ?
You go on .
I 'll wait here .
Yes , sir .
There , that 's about it .
We 'll make absolutely sure tomorrow noon .
Oh , must be almost midnight .
Hey .
Look at that .
Torches going through the village .
Yeah , looks like the night before election .
Listen to them .
Wonder what 's up .
Wish I could take pictures by firelight .
- I 'd sneak ashore and get a scene now .
- Oh , be sensible .
We 're lucky to be all safe aboard tonight .
Yeah , I guess so .
- Charlie , have you seen missy ?
- Me no see one , two hours .
When we leave this place ?
Me no like .
Ann .
Ann .
All hands on deck ! Everybody on deck !
Everybody on deck ! All hands on deck !
Everybody on deck ! Everybody on deck !
- What 's the matter ?
What 's happening ?
- What 's going on ?
- What 's the matter ?
- I 'm out here .
Look , sir . Me find on deck .
- A native bracelet .
- Crazy black man been here .
What is it ?
Who turned out the crew ?
- Look .
Someone 's been aboard .
- Where 's Ann ? - In her cabin .
- No , she isn 't .
I just looked .
- What 's the matter , Mr. Driscoll ?
- Search the ship . Find Miss Darrow .
Aye , aye .
- Ann .
Oh , Ann .
Did you see her ?
- No .
I 'll look below .
- Did you find her ?
- Can 't find her forward .
- She 's not below .
- Can 't find her aft .
Ann 's gone !
Serve out the rifles .
Man the boats .
Take this ammunition outside .
Come on , you fellas . Grab these guns .
Take these bomb cases and be careful with them .
Pass those rifles up over the side .
Start packing those bombs .
Me likey go too .
Me likey catch missy .
This is no job for a cook . Get out of here .
Come on .
Shove her off , men . We 're going over the side .
Give way , gentlemen .
Right over there .
They 've taken Ann .
Hurry . Hurry up .
She must be up ahead here .
- Come on , men .
- Come on , boys .
Has anybody seen her ?
Come on .
Get this gate open . Quick !
Get up there , men .
Pull that thing back !
Pull that bar back .
He 's got Ann .
Heave .
Heave .
Heave .
Heave .
- Who 's going with me ?
- I 'll go .
You stay with half the men and guard the gate .
- Don 't let them close it .
- We 'll take care of it .
No telling which way he went in this darkness .
He 's been through here .
- Look at these broken branches .
- Yeah , look at that .
Keep up , fellas .
It ought to be sunup about now .
Yeah , just listen to those birds .
It 's dawn all right .
- What 's that ?
- Holy mackerel !
Yeah , that 's his track .
Look at the size of that thing .
He must be as big as a house .
He 's headed this way .
Come on , fellas , and keep those guns cocked .
Hate to have that thing wrapped around me .
Here 's another one .
We 're on his trail .
Sure , sure . I know that .
Come on . Come on , fellas .
Hey , look at that !
Keep quiet .
He doesn 't see us .
Give me one of those bombs .
Look , it 's gonna charge .
Keep quiet .
Come on .
Give him another one .
Look out !
Look out .
He 's still alive .
Shoot .
Come on .
That got him .
What do you call this thing ?
Why , something from the dinosaur family .
Dinosaur , eh ?
Yes , Jack a prehistoric beast .
Say , just look at the length of that brute .
If I could only bring back one of these alive .
- Watch that tail !
He 's still alive .
- Come on , looks like he 's standing up .
He 's through .
Come on .
Come on , men .
Boy , one swipe of that .
- Hear that ?
- Yeah . What is it ?
That 's him , boys .
Come on .
Here . Here 's his mark again .
- There 's water ahead .
- He 's down in that fog somewhere .
Yes , that 's him splashing through .
Be careful .
Now , watch the step-off , boys .
Must have swum across .
Yeah , it 'll be tough for us with these guns and bombs .
- What about these logs for a raft ?
- Good idea .
Come , fellas . Get busy .
Put those guns down on the bank and get going .
Move !
Come on with those poles .
All set , everybody ?
Shove off !
- Hear anything ?
- No , he 's miles away by now .
We 'll be able to pick up his trail all right .
Listen .
Quiet .
What was it ?
Hang on , men .
Look out .
Here he comes .
Come on .
Come on .
Hey , Jack .
Jack Driscoll .
- Hey , Jack .
- Denham .
- It didn 't get you , huh ?
- No , I got to cover , same as you .
- Think we 're safe ?
- There are two of us left alive to save her .
- I can 't get across now .
Don 't want you to .
Lam back and get more bombs .
Why , you wouldn 't follow that beast alone .
Someone 's gotta stay on his trail .
I 'll get a chance , sneak her away .
I 'll figure a way to signal you where he 's taken her .
- I guess that 's our only out .
- Sure it is .
Get going .
Don 't get killed till you see Englehorn .
Okay , Jack .
Good luck .
Skipper , this Kong is the biggest thing in the world .
He shook those men off that log like they were flies .
All those men lost .
It 's incredible .
Driscoll said he 'd try and signal us if he found Ann .
- We 'll never see them again .
- Don 't give up .
- There 's chance for Driscoll .
- Wait for daylight .
We 'll bridge the ravine .
Where 's that case of bombs ?
- Here , sir .
- This ...
This monster you 've seen , you think your bombs will stop him ?
If we can get close enough to use them , you bet they 'll stop him .
- Had any trouble with the natives ?
- Yes , after you left .
- What happened ?
- We fired volleys over their heads , they ran like rabbits .
Gunpowder 's new in their lives ?
- They 're terrified .
- They haven 't shown up .
Take a man on the wall , keep your eyes peeled .
We leave at dawn , if we get a signal or not .
Yes , sir .
Hey , look .
Hey , below , Mr. Denham .
Captain Englehorn .
Mr. Driscoll and the lady , they 're coming back .
Come on , fellas .
Are you both all right ?
Pint , Jack .
Here .
I 'm all right .
What happened ?
How did you do it ?
- Came down the river .
- Oh , Jack .
There , there , you 're safe now .
We 'll have you back on the ship in no time .
Wait a minute .
What about Kong ?
Well , what about him ?
We came to get a movie , and we found something worth more than all the movies in the world .
We 've got those gas bombs .
- If we can capture him alive ...
- Why , you 're crazy .
He 's on a cliff where a whole army couldn 't get at him .
- Yeah , if he stays there but we 've got something he wants .
Yeah , something he won 't get again .
Hey , look out .
It 's Kong .
Kong 's coming .
Come around .
Come here and hold the gates .
Quick . - Denham , natives are coming .
- Good work .
Come on .
Hey , come back with those bombs , you ...
Come on .
Come on . I got him .
He 'll be out for hours . Send to the ship .
- For anchor chains and tools .
- What will you do ?
A raft to float him to the ship .
The whole world will pay to see this .
- No chains will hold that .
- We 'll give him more than chains .
He 's always been king of his world , but we 'll teach him fear .
We 're millionaires , boys .
I 'll share it with all of you .
In a few months , it 'll be up in lights on Broadway :
" Kong , the Eighth Wonder of the World . "
Say , what 's Denham got anyway ?
It better be good after all this ballyhoo .
Heavens , what a mob .
Well , you would come .
These tickets cost me 20 bucks .
I can 't sit so near the screen . It hurts my eyes .
This is not a moving picture , madam .
What ?
Mr. Denham makes those pictures of those darling monkeys and tigers and things .
This is in the nature of a personal appearance .
Well , I never .
I thought I was gonna see something .
- Say , what is it anyhow ?
- I hear it 's a kind of a gorilla .
Gee , ain 't we got enough of them in New York ?
I don 't like to look at him .
It makes me think of that awful day on the island .
I wouldn 't have brought you , but you know how Denham insisted .
We had to come when he said it would help the show .
Do you think we 'll make a lot of money ?
Well , enough to pay him back for these clothes anyway .
It 's the first time I ever had on one of these open-front suits .
Hello , there .
Just in time . Gee , Ann , you look great .
I 'm glad I dressed you up for this show .
Well , Jack , $ 10,000 in the box office .
- Not bad for one night .
- That 's a lot of money .
We 're gonna do that every night .
- Look at the size of that .
- I hope he 's tied up tight .
Sure he is .
Denham 's taking no chances .
Here are the press .
Come in , boys .
- This is Ms. Darrow and Mr. Driscoll .
- How do you do ?
Mr. Driscoll saved you from the ape ?
Yes .
He was alone too .
All the sailors with him had been killed .
- How did you ever tackle that baby ?
- Well , Mr. Denham got him .
The rest of us were running scared . He had the nerve to stand there and chuck bombs .
Oh , so you 're the hero .
Come on , give us a story .
Here now , wait a minute .
Lay off me , boys .
Miss Darrow is the story .
If it hadn 't been for her we couldn 't have gotten near Kong .
He followed her .
- Beauty and the beast , huh ?
- That 's it .
Play up that angle , beauty and the beast .
Kong could have stayed safe but he couldn 't stay away from beauty .
- That 's your story , boys .
- That 's a lead story , all right .
- How about some pictures ?
- Just a minute .
Come on the stage .
Take pictures in front of the audience .
I 'll make a speech and tell them about Kong , Darrow Driscoll .
When I call you , come take pictures .
- Okay .
- That 's fine .
Stand by , Ann , when I call you .
Now , now , it 's all right .
We 've knocked some of the fight out of him since you saw him .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am here tonight to tell you a very strange story .
A story so strange that no one will believe it .
But , ladies and gentlemen , seeing is believing and we , my partners and I have brought back the living proof of our adventure .
... an adventure in which 12 of our party met horrible deaths .
And now , ladies and gentlemen , before I tell you any more I am going to show you the greatest thing your eyes ever beheld .
He was a king and a god in the world he knew but now he comes to civilization merely a captive a show to gratify your curiosity .
Ladies and gentlemen , look at Kong . The Eighth Wonder of the World .
And now I want to introduce Miss Ann Darrow the bravest girl I have ever known .
There the beast and here the beauty .
She has lived through an experience no other woman ever dreamed of .
And she was saved from the very grasp of Kong by her future husband .
I want you to meet a very brave gentleman , Mr. John Driscoll .
And now before I tell you the full story of our voyage I will ask the gentlemen of the press to come forward so that the audience may see them take the first photographs of Kong and his captors .
All right , boys .
Miss Darrow first , alone .
Stand in front of Kong , Ann .
- All set ?
Make it a good one .
- Okay .
Shoot .
Don 't be alarmed .
Those chains are made of chrome steel .
- It 's all right , Ann .
- Get them together , boys .
- They 're going to be married tomorrow .
- Put your arm around her , Driscoll .
Wait a minute .
Hold on .
- He thinks you 're attacking the girl .
- All the roaring , swell picture .
Come on , it 's loose !
Send the riot squad and ambulances .
Kong has escaped .
You 're safe now , dear .
It 's like a horrible dream .
It 's like being back on the island again .
Now , it 's all right .
Don 't worry .
I 'm gonna stay right here with you .
Anyhow , you know they 're bound to get him .
Jack , he 's climbing up outside there .
- He 's got Ann .
He 's taken her up .
- The roof , quick .
Ann , Ann !
How can we follow him ?
What 'll we do ?
Fire department searchlights on the roof .
Yeah , they 'll keep him in sight .
Attention all stations .
Kong is going west .
He is making for the Empire State Building .
Stand by for further reports .
- If he goes up there , what can we do ?
- We won 't get near him .
Kong is climbing the Empire State Building .
He is still carrying Ann Darrow .
That is all .
That licks us .
- One thing we haven 't thought of .
- What ?
Airplanes .
If he should put Ann down and they fly close to pick him without her ...
You 're right .
Planes .
Call the field .
- Here come the planes .
- They 'll get him .
- Can they shoot him and not hit Ann ?
- They 'll be shooting .
Ann .
Ann , hang on , dear .
- Ann , are you all right ?
- Jack !
Just a moment .
Wait a minute .
Let me through .
My name is Denham .
Just a moment . Oh , lieutenant .
- Lieutenant , I 'm Carl Denham .
- Carl Denham .
Denham ?
Oh , that 's the man that captured the monster .
Well , Denham , the airplanes got him .
Oh , no , it wasn 't the airplanes . It was beauty killed the beast .
Wind 's from the south .
Gonna rain .
Tonight , maybe .
Don 't you worry .
I 'll take care of your father 's grave .
Train 's coming soon .
I was in Berlin once .
Thirty years ago .
Big place .
No end to it .
Well , Lily ... go to church every Sunday , and obey your aunt .
She 's all you got .
Yes , she 's the last .
Well , then ... goodbye .
Thank you , Miss .
Are you Lily ?
Yes , Tante Rasmussen .
Did you have to arrive in the middle of the night ?
The train doesn 't leave until 7 : 00 in the evening . Huh .
Well , haven 't you got a kiss for your old aunt ?
There , there , there , there , there , there , there , now .
Let 's have a look at you .
I 'd forgotten people wore clothes like that .
- What have you got there ?
- My things .
Well , bring ' em here .
I 'm going to give you my daughters ' room -
My ungrateful , unnatural daughters ... who deserted their old mother .
But I tore them out of my heart .
I 've torn them out by the roots .
And all my love shall be for you .
Not as my niece , no . As my own child .
Yes , Tante Rasmussen .
Why , what 's this ?
- A Bible ?
- It was his .
Is that all your scamp of a father left you , a Bible ?
He wasn 't a scamp .
He was a good man .
I don 't know what he was good for .
Leaving you a charge on your old aunt .
However , he taught you to read . That 's something .
Maybe you 'll be of some use about the shop after all .
My father was a good man .
Every night I read to him from this Bible .
The Lamentations of Job , no doubt . No .
The Song of Solomon .
He loved it best .
I don 't remember the Song of Solomon ... but knowing your father , I imagine there was something dirty in it .
The Song of Songs is beautiful .
That 's more than I can say for your get-up .
- He was a good man . - All right , all right .
He was a good man .
Take that black pancake off your head ... and climb out of that shroud .
See if these will fit you .
They belonged to Anna .
- Have you had your supper ?
- I 'm not hungry , thanks . Good .
Then you might as well go to bed .
And in the morning I 'll start teaching you about the books .
I 'll lock up tonight , but after this you 'll do it .
Yes , Tante Rasmussen .
We open the shop at 6 : 00 and breakfast is at 7 : 00 .
And you 'll have a good home here if you behave .
But you might as well understand right now I 'll tolerate no nonsense .
No , Tante Rasmussen . Mercy !
How many of those things do you wear ?
What , another ?
I 've never seen a girl unpeel herself like an onion before .
This is the last .
A figure like that will get you into trouble if you 're not careful .
You 'll bear watching .
Go to bed .
Goodnight .
My precious brother .
Isn 't it like him ?
Dies and leaves me his daughter ... with nine petticoats and a Bible .
Does he leave any money ?
Not a pfennig .
A daughter and a Bible .
Always was a restless , good-for-nothing , no-account chap .
" By night on my bed ... " I sought him ... " whom my soul loveth .
" I will rise now ... " and go about the city . " In the streets and in the broad ways ...
- Are you looking for a book , sir ?
- What ?
I said , are you looking for a book ? When a man goes into a book shop ... he 's usually looking for a book . Well , I 'll tell you .
Of course , he might be looking for the fountain of youth ... but I don 't think you sell that .
I meant , is there some special book you 're looking for ? Ha !
There is nothing special .
Everything is just the same as everything else .
Well , I 'm afraid I can 't help you . No .
No , I 'm afraid you can 't .
No . No , no !
Stand up again . - Stand up . I want to see you .
- No , I will not . Oh , I see .
You think I 'm interested in your legs .
Well , I 'm not - at least , not just as legs .
My dear child , if you 'd seen as many legs as I have ... you 'd get more excited about a pair of crutches .
I 'm a sculptor , my dear , a sculptor - or that is , I 'm supposed to be ... and there was something about you as you stood there that - that was almost an idea .
Are you the sculptor that lives across the street ?
I 'm the sculptor that 's going crazy across the street ! Why ?
What 's the matter ?
- I 'm stuck .
- Stuck ?
- Yes . Stuck .
- You mean
- You mean -
- I mean I 'm stuck . - Yes , I know , but -
Oh , don 't say you know and then say " but . "
If you can 't talk straight , don 't talk at all .
Now , come on , please . Stand up .
This is a book store ... and if you don 't want to buy a book ... then better go back and - and be stuck .
I don 't have to go back . I 'm just as stuck here . That 's the trouble .
The trouble is , you 're probably no good anyway .
Do you know , I never thought of that .
I tell you what .
You come over and pose for me .
- Perhaps you 'll bring me inspiration .
- No , thank you . - How about 8 : 00 , hmm ?
- I wouldn 't wait , if I were you .
Oh , no , no , no .
But you must come .
You know , I believe I could get something really interesting .
Oh-Oh , please come . Please come , won 't you ?
- You must be crazy .
- Well , what 's that got to do with it ?
I don 't know you .
Well , I don 't know you either , but I 've got to sculpt you .
Now , when will you come ?
Tonight ?
Certainly not .
You know , really , I should have thought ... that living here as you do , among all these marvellous books ... you would have had some sympathy for art .
If you 'll come , I 'll buy a book .
- Oh , you will ?
- I-I 'll even read the blessed thing .
It 's no use .
I couldn 't -
- I shall expect you .
- You are crazy .
- Tonight at 8 : 00 .
- Please go away .
- Oh , please come .
Please come .
- Never .
Well , I shall expect you .
Auf Wiedersehen .
What did he want ?
Oh , nothing .
- Didn 't he take a book ?
- No .
He was just looking .
Well , you get on with your work .
And don 't you let me catch you carrying on with any young men .
No , Tante Rasmussen .
Come in .
Come in , come in .
I don 't believe it !
I only came to -
Oh , never mind why you came .
You 're here , that 's the main thing .
Oh , come in , come in .
It was wrong of me to come . It was charming - charming of you .
Here .
Here , let me take this .
If Tante Rasmussen should find out -
You know , I believe you 're scared of her .
Well , so am I.
Are you still stuck ?
Well , I was , but hope has come in now , hasn 't she ?
I 've been making a sketch of you .
- You want to see yourself ?
- Oh , yes !
I haven 't any clothes on ! - Clothes ?
Do you think I model people with their clothes on ?
But how did you know I was like that ?
And just what does that mean ?
I mean it is me and-and it isn 't me .
I mean it 's - Go on .
This begins to sound like art criticism of the highest order .
Oh , it 's wonderful .
I mean , it 's the way I want to be .
- It 's me as I dream of me .
It 's the girl in the Song of Songs .
- Who ?
- The girl in the Song of Songs .
- She 's in the Bible .
- The Bible ?
She 's the girl who feels in her heart ... that somewhere the perfect love is waiting for her .
She says , " I sleep , but my heart waketh . " It is the voice of my beloved saying ...
'Open to me my love , my undefiled . " ' - Mercy on us !
- Oh , I know what she means .
I know it because I feel it inside .
I mean , it is the voice of my beloved , that 's what I mean .
Hold that pose !
Now , don 't move . Yes .
Yes , that 's wonderful .
Yes , there 's my statue , and we 'll call it The Song of Songs .
- Oh , really ?
- Think of it !
What luck to find just what I 've been looking for in old Rasmussen 's book shop .
Take your clothes off . What ?
Take your
- Well , what 's the matter ? What 's the matter ?
I can 't take my clothes off .
- Why ?
Why can 't you ? - Why , I -
I 'd be undressed .
Well , what do you expect to be ?
All you need is the face .
Everything is in the face .
Oh , I see .
You 're going to tell me how to do it now .
No , but - but -
Oh , now , now , now , look here .
You mustn 't think of me as a man .
Don 't you realize that ?
Why , a-a model means no more to me than a tree .
All I see is the-the-the thing she creates .
- Look , what 's your name ?
- Lily .
Well , now , Lily , don 't irritate me with silly prejudices .
I see you as an artist .
You must believe that , Lily .
I mean - Well , I mean , you must believe that .
- Yes , I think I believe that . - Good .
Well , now , come on .
You see that curtain ?
Well , you can undress behind there .
Now , wait a minute .
Take this and put it around you .
There 's a good girl .
Now , don 't be long .
Oh , there you are . That 's right .
Step up there .
You can drop the smock .
It 's cold .
Cold ?
I hadn 't noticed it .
Well ? Well ?
Are you going to stand like that ?
What about the voice of your beloved ? Why don 't you listen to it ?
It 's pretty hard to listen when you are as embarrassed as I am .
Oh , you 'll get used to it .
And what 's more , I 'm freezing .
You 'll get used to that too .
I don 't understand how I ever got into this .
Now , look here .
Wait a minute .
Wait a minute and take it easy .
You don 't have to do this , you know , if you don 't want to . Hmm ? Well , all right .
You put your clothes on and go home .
No . I said I 'd do it , and I will do it .
That 's the way to talk !
Good !
Lily !
Close the window !
An earthquake wouldn 't wake her .
The brat !
All right .
That 's enough for now .
I 'll get it .
I 'll get it .
Next the clay , and then the marble .
- The Song of Songs in marble .
- Was I all right ?
You were fine at first .
You got a bit tired later .
Come in .
- Am I welcome ?
- Yes , of course . Come in , Baron .
I saw your light so I thought I 'd drop in to see what you were up to .
- Well , I 've been working .
- Good !
It 's about time .
There 's the beginning of your statue , Baron .
Not bad .
- Do you see any idea to it ?
- She 's a little beauty . Oh .
That 's all you see , eh ?
It 's enough for me .
- Oh , is she , uh , here ? - Yes .
Yes , she 's in there .
Oh .
Not , uh - Not overdone ?
- As good as this , really ? - Uh-huh .
Mm-hmm !
A pretty face as well as the hidden charms .
- I 'd like to meet the young lady . - Mmm . Oh , Lily .
This is Colonel von Merzbach .
Lily .
How do you do , my dear ?
How do you do ?
So you are to be our young friend 's inspiration , huh ?
Oh , these artists are privileged people .
- I think I 'd better go .
- If I thought I 'd frightened you away ... I 'd never forgive myself .
You know , I 'm not altogether an intruder .
The statue our young friend is to do of you ... will belong to me .
I 've already paid him for it .
- But it 's late . I must go .
- Oh , that 's a pity .
But no doubt we shall meet again .
Now that I 've seen you , the statue will interest me more than ever .
Goodbye .
Well , tomorrow night ?
- But -
- The same time .
A lovely girl .
Lovely .
Where have you been ?
Where have you been ?
Sneaking out of my house !
I 'll show you !
Where did you find her ?
Oh , I , uh - I just found her .
She 's not a professional model ?
Oh , no , no .
She works in the book shop across the street . Why ?
She interests me .
Of course , my dear Richard , if there is any reason why I shouldn 't be interested - Oh , none at all .
She means nothing to me .
Fine .
Because she interests me very much .
Very much .
" Mrs Rasmussen , " he said ...
" you have a very beautiful daughter . "
" She 's my niece , " I said .
Then he gives his moustaches a twist ... and he asks would I be offended ... if he was to show his admiration ... by making you a little present .
Old fool .
And him a colonel too .
I said , " I don 't allow my niece to accept presents from gentlemen . " But , " I says , " she sometimes takes a little rum with her tea . "
And I said , " I see no harm if you 'd care to send her some . "
And he -
It 's the very best kind .
It comes from Jamaica .
I suppose you never heard of Jamaica .
No , Tante Rasmussen .
It 's a place in Asia Minor .
A drop of rum in your tea is supposed to build up your strength ... only the doctor says you must take it ... after you 've got into bed and be sure to keep well covered ... as it 's heating to the blood ... and you 're liable to take a chill .
You can bring it now , my child .
Bring the bottle too .
You 're a good girl , Lily .
If I 'm severe with you sometimes ... it 's because I have your own welfare at heart .
We 've forgotten the sugar .
Uh , j-j-just half a spoonful , dear .
Thank you , darling .
You weren 't very nice to the Baron yesterday morning .
Now , next time he comes , I want you to smile and be civil .
- Yes , Tante Rasmussen . - Goodnight , darling .
- You can go to bed now .
- Thank you .
Goodnight .
Goodnight .
- Say your prayers .
- I will .
Jamaica .
- I know , I know .
Late again .
Third time this week .
I don 't see anything funny about keeping a man waiting .
- And what 's that ?
- Flowers .
- Well , where did you get them ?
- A man .
- Oh , the Baron , I suppose .
- Oh , no .
- Who , then ?
- I don 't know him .
I met him downstairs in the street .
Do you mean to say you accepted flowers from a stranger in the street ? Oh , he was such a handsome man !
What 's that got to do with it ?
Nothing .
I never heard of such a thing .
A perfect stranger and you accept -
Why-Why , i-it 's positively indecent .
Jealous ?
I ? Oh !
Certainly not .
It 's nothing to me what you do .
You sounded jealous .
Don 't be ridiculous .
Well , come on , come on . Let 's get to work .
Well ?
Aren 't they lovely ?
Let 's get to work .
- Oh , smell them !
- Oh , come here !
Look what you 've done .
And I bought them for you .
Well , thanks .
Well , let 's get to work , shall we ?
Oh , yeah . All right .
Uh , ready , then .
Are you warm enough ?
Yes .
I finally found the coal man .
Told him if he didn 't deliver some coal I 'd -
Told him I 'd , uh -
Told him something .
No .
You , uh - You 've turned too far .
No , this way .
Look .
What 's the matter ?
Nothing .
Santa
Lucia
You were off-key .
Well , I can 't sing , row the boat and admire you all at the same time .
- Something has to go .
- Why don 't you throw me overboard ?
Now , that 's a good idea .
Why didn 't I think of that before ?
Wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
Come on .
Now , gently does it .
Careful .
Come on !
You happy ?
- What do you think ?
Well , I think you look a bit surly . Yes .
Yes , I see a distinct resemblance to your Aunt Rasmussen .
It 's striking .
Another Rasmussen !
Good heavens , what have I fallen in love with ?
- Are you tired ?
- No .
Well , come on .
Let 's take that path up through the woods .
- Oh , yes .
Let 's get lost !
- Forever .
Forever .
Come on .
- Oh , Excellency !
- Good day , Frau Rasmussen .
- The young lady is -
- I-Is out on an errand , Excellency . Ah .
I 've bought her some rum .
Oh , Excellency !
Two whole jugs full .
She will be very grateful .
I want to talk to you .
Let 's not beat about the bush , Frau Rasmussen .
I have a library - a very extensive library - and I require someone to take care of it - someone familiar with books .
Your niece could do it very well .
My niece , Excellency ?
She would have to live at my place .
I 'm prepared to pay her a very liberal salary .
Why , Excellency , my niece could hardly -
All the proprieties would be observed .
Still , Excellency , a young girl in a bachelor 's household -
A very rare edition .
A thousand marks ?
That 's a lot of money for a book .
Understand me , Frau Rasmussen .
When I set my mind on a thing ... I usually get it , one way or another .
Perhaps your Excellency would be interested in my other books .
Yes , no doubt , no doubt .
I shall be dropping in from time to time .
Let me see .
What were we talking about ?
Oh , yes .
Your niece .
- Oh , smell that .
- What ?
Mmm , the grass and the earth .
Oh , smell this grass .
- I don 't smell anything .
- Oh , you 're so funny , darling .
Look what he calls grass .
No .
You 've got to bury your nose in it .
You 've got to get into the ground .
You 've just got to be grass !
You 've got spring fever .
Kiss me .
You know , I won 't have you squandering all that love on grass and things .
What about me , hmm ?
When I put my hands on the earth ... it 's you I 'm touching .
The wind on my face is your kisses .
You are in everything I think and feel and do ... and will be till I die .
Darling !
You know , you frighten me sometimes .
Why ?
Well , when I think if anything should happen to us .
Oh , nothing is going to happen .
No , no . But still , supposing something did .
People in love have had to separate , you know .
Oh , but not we .
You 'll be rich and famous ... and I 'll always pose for you ... and we 'll have a fine home and children ... and we 'll grow old together ... and every day I 'll love you twice as much as I did the day before .
" Set me as a seal upon thine heart ... " as a seal upon thine arm .
For love is strong as death . "
That 's fine .
The best you 've ever done .
And the model ?
She 's well , thank you .
How 's your romance coming on ?
Oh , Baron .
Let 's stick to art .
Oh , don 't be offended , Richard .
- Anyone can see the girl adores you .
- Well , I adore her too .
- But , uh -
- But what ?
Oh , nothing , nothing .
She has notions in her head about eternal fidelity , marriage and children .
Oh , it 's all very awkward .
And you haven 't thought of marriage , naturally .
Well , I 've a career to make and no money and ... well , marriage is something -
Well , what do you propose to do about it ?
What can I do ?
If I go on with it , I 'll be doing her a grave injustice .
On the other hand -
Oh , it 's the devil of a mess .
- Leave her . - Huh !
How would that help ?
Well , it 's kinder to do it now than later .
The longer you 're together , the harder it 'll be for her to get over you .
No .
- Give her to me .
- To you ?
Give her to me , Richard .
I can make her happy , and you won 't .
More , I can - I can educate her , refine her to a great lady .
And I can provide for her , yes .
And love her .
This is the most preposterous - W-What do you take me for ?
When you say that , are you thinking of yourself or of her ?
For a temporary paradise , are you willing to kick a helpless girl into a permanent hell ?
- No .
- Now , now .
Hear me out .
I 'm getting old , Richard .
And for some time now , I 've been thinking of resigning from the Army ... retiring to my place in the country to finish my life ... among my books , my paintings , my statues and my farm .
It would amuse me to devote the rest of my days to - to her .
To mould the real Lily just as you have this statue .
To make her my masterpiece , just as I think you 've made this yours .
How could I give her to you , even if I wanted to ?
And I don 't .
All I ask is that you step aside and give me a chance to win her .
Oh , th-this is obscene !
Obscene !
Because I 'm not as young as you ?
Obscene , because I consider her welfare and you don 't ?
Obscene , because I 'm willing to marry her and you 're not ?
Yes , stare !
That 's how I want her .
Enough to make her the Baroness von Merzbach .
Now , tell me again that what I 'm asking is obscene !
Surprised , eh ?
You didn 't know I knew all about your midnight excursions .
- Tante , I -
- You go to your lover and stay there !
- Stay there ?
Oh , Tante -
- I warned you .
I 've appealed to your better nature .
I 've scolded you .
Why , I 've even beaten you !
And all to no avail .
Now there 's nothing left but to put you out !
Oh , please . Maybe I was wrong . But if you 'd let me explain -
I 'm not interested in the details of your sin . Sin ?
Oh , it wasn 't sin .
Get out !
Get out .
And don 't come back .
Goodbye , Tante Rasmussen .
- Where 's Richard ? - He 's gone .
Left today .
- Gone ?
Where ?
- To Italy , I think . - Italy -
- He asked me to see you and explain .
- When is he coming back ?
- Not for a long time .
Perhaps never .
I don 't believe you .
Richard !
There 's a note for you .
I 'm sorry .
Don 't take it too hard , my child .
It 's unfortunate , but Waldow 's an artist .
All he wanted of you was this statue ... - and now it 's finished .
- No .
- I 'm afraid it is so , my child . - No .
I don 't believe you .
- He isn 't like that .
- You don 't know him .
Waldow hates scenes .
That 's why he asked me to stay and see you .
No , he couldn 't .
He loves me , I tell you .
He told me he loved me .
No , you 're lying .
You 're lying !
Lily .
Lily , my poor child .
It will pass .
Everything passes .
I know .
Don 't be afraid .
You 're not alone .
I 'll see you through this .
I 'll do everything in the world for you .
Everything .
Everything .
Things he couldn 't do - wouldn 't do .
Ah , now come . Come , Lily .
- Oh , leave me alone .
- Come , my dear .
Oh , no .
Let me alone .
Let me alone .
Lily , you don 't understand .
I love you , my dear , and he didn 't .
You think he 's the only thing in life ?
Trust me .
Believe me .
- I 'll make a great lady of you . - No , no .
No !
I 'll make you my wife , Lily .
You shall be my heir .
I have no one else but you , Lily , no one .
And I love you .
- I love you !
- Oh , Richard .
Richard !
Are you going to let him spoil your life ?
He didn 't let you disturb his , did he ?
He took what he wanted and was through with you !
Lily , my darling , I want to give .
I want to give you everything .
Love , happiness , position , money .
He didn 't consider you his equal .
I do .
I 'll make you more than his equal .
I 'll make you the Baroness von Merzbach !
Then when you see him again , you can treat him as he 's treated you .
Patronize him , scorn him , revenge yourself upon him .
He lied to you .
Don 't let him crush you .
He lied to me .
What for ?
What for ?
- And only yesterday -
- That was a thousand years ago , my dear ... and I 'll make you believe it never happened .
The Baroness .
This is Fraulein von Schwertfeger , the , uh , housekeeper .
This , my dear , is Edward von Prell .
My felicitations , Baron .
Baroness .
Edward works for us . He 's an agriculturalist .
Good blood , though .
His father carried a sword , but he chose the plough .
My Lord , may we extend our heartfelt congratulations ?
Very good , very good , very good .
- Supper is ready , Baron . - Huh .
No supper , no supper , no supper .
But , uh , another glass of champagne might be acceptable , huh ?
To our wedding night !
Come , come ! Drink up !
Drink up !
I 'm not used to champagne .
It 'll make me dizzy . Heh .
All the better .
All the better .
That 's right .
I shall join you presently , my love .
Are you looking for a book , sir ?
Are you the sculptor that lives across the street ?
When I put my hands on the earth , it 's you I 'm touching .
The wind on my face is your kisses .
You are in everything I think and feel and do ... and will be till I die .
Set me as a seal upon thine heart ... as a seal upon thine arm ... for love is strong as death .
Two , three .
One , two , three . One , two , three .
Easy .
Relax . One , two , three .
One , two , three . That 's very nice .
Watch your phrasing , please .
Your left hand , please .
It 's very important .
Very good .
Now ... it 's a little difficult , but -
Oh , fine !
Very good !
And now , Fraulein Toller will favour us .
I 'm pleased with you , Lily . Very pleased .
- What 's the matter ?
- Nothing .
Our guests .
Oh , they don 't matter .
They 're nobodies .
I only brought them here for you to practise on .
And you 've done very well , Lily .
I 'm very , very proud of you .
Next month , I 'm going to give you a grand ball .
I 'll invite anybody of any consequence to meet the Baroness von Merzbach .
Aren 't you pleased ?
- Yes .
- Heh ! I 'll invite Waldow , too .
I want him to see you now .
He 'll marvel at my work .
You want him to see you , huh ?
If you like .
What 's the matter with you ?
You 're always as cold as Waldow 's statue .
Are you still in love with him ?
Answer me !
I never think of him .
Never .
- I beg your pardon . - Huh ?
What 's the matter ?
- Shall I have coffee served to the guests ?
- No , get rid of them . Look here .
Why do you follow us about all the time ... sticking your nose in at unexpected moments ?
Are you jealous of my wife ?
I might have been .
Well , then ?
Oh , I 've spoken to von Prell about riding lessons for your wife .
- Riding lessons ?
- You 've apparently forgotten our conversation .
- The Baroness ought to be taught to ride . - Perhaps , perhaps , perhaps .
Everybody rides .
It might be awkward when you show her off .
- Von Prell 's a good horseman .
- Very well .
So he is .
All right . You see to it . At once .
Then I can tell the Baron you 'll give her the first lesson tomorrow ?
- With pleasure .
- Thank you .
And Edward .
I 'd be careful .
- The Baron is very jealous .
- Why , I don 't know what you mean .
I happen to know the Baroness admires you .
- In fact , she 's spoken of it .
- Me ?
- You 're not in earnest ?
- Oh , don 't look so surprised .
After all , you 're both young .
The Baron is old , and -
Well , just be careful .
That 's all .
Pleasant spot , isn 't it ?
Shall we sit here and rest a bit , Baroness ?
You must not trouble so much about me , Mr von Prell .
Trouble about you , Baroness ?
Why , there 's nothing in this world I - I wouldn 't do for you .
Is this part of my riding lesson ?
You know ... I wish people were as free to say and do what they think as that water .
Oh , the water isn 't free .
It is hemmed in ... by banks on both sides .
You know what I mean .
Are you making love to me ?
I love you .
From the day you came , I 've loved you .
You were never out of my thoughts .
I 've watched you .
I 've even felt you in my arms .
Yes , I know all about that .
That 's what they call love .
I know that you 're unhappy .
I know that you -
I know that I want you .
Still I love you .
Remember that .
- Perhaps some day - - Let 's say no more about it .
Come on .
We 'll ride home .
Being the Baroness von Merzbach suits her very well , Waldow .
I 've done something of a job if I may say so . - Uh ?
- Yes , you modelled her in marble ... I modelled her in the flesh , so to speak .
I 'm a bit of an artist myself , don 't you think ?
- She 's happy , of course ?
- Oh , of course , of course !
You 'll see for yourself .
- Charming .
Charming .
- So good to see you again .
Waldow 's changed , don 't you think ?
Looks , uh , thinner .
A bit peaked .
I haven 't seen you since your return from Italy .
- Or was it Italy ?
Tell me about yourself .
There 's nothing to tell .
Dinner is served .
Ah , dinner !
That 's the word .
Uh , will you take Lily , my dear Waldow ?
The young first , the old trailing behind .
Yes , there 's a treat in store for you , Waldow .
Anything you say .
Mozart , Meyerbeer , Mendelssohn .
You wouldn 't believe what a musician she 's become .
Isn 't that right , Lily ?
- I 'm afraid you exaggerate .
- Oh , no , no .
You-You 're too modest , my dear .
I tell you , she plays beautifully .
Anything !
You 'll hear for yourself after dinner .
You 'll play for Waldow , won 't you , my dear ?
- If you like it . - Ah !
There 's a wife for you !
Yes .
And dance !
Y-You haven 't danced with her yet , have you , Waldow ?
You will !
Y-You 'll dance with Waldow , won 't you , my dear ?
- If he likes .
- Of course he likes !
- Of course .
Wouldn 't you , Waldow ?
- Of course , sir .
Of course !
You can talk to her about anything you like , my dear boy .
Anything .
Books , art
- Why , she speaks French just like a native , don 't you , Lily ?
- Hardly .
- I tell you she does !
You hear me ?
- Just like a native !
- I 'm sure of it .
Yes , she does .
And she reads everything .
Everything . All the latest books .
I 'll bet she 's ahead of you , Waldow .
Say , what-what are you reading now , my love ?
Nothing .
What 's the matter with you two ?
Not a word out of you all evening .
Aren 't you glad to see each other ?
You ought to be glad to see Waldow .
You owe everything to him .
Doesn 't she , Waldow ?
I-I haven 't told you how much we owe to Waldow , have I , my love ?
Merzbach !
You remember , Waldow , your saying ... mmm ...
" She has a notion in her head about eternal fidelity . Marriage , children , and all that .
Oh , it 's a devil of a mess . " Lily , Lily .
Please , I -
" Stick to your art , " say I , " and let me have the girl . "
And he does , by gad !
Merzbach , this is monstrous !
Well , it 's the truth , isn 't it ?
There 's friendship for you .
The noble Waldow graciously steps aside ... so that his old friend might renew his youth .
Lily .
Lily . I beg of you -
Was this what you brought me down here for ?
Well , it was the truth , wasn 't it ?
Do her good to hear it .
Getting uppish anyhow .
Lily .
Lily !
Please listen to me , Lily .
No , no , no . You must hear me , Lily . He 's twisted and distorted everything .
Lily ! Lily !
I had nothing to offer you .
I was poor .
I thought there was something better in store for you .
You 've never been out of my thoughts , or my heart .
I love you .
I 've always loved you .
Oh , let me take you away from here .
You 're unhappy !
- Unhappy ?
- You can 't deny it .
You forget I 'm a Baroness .
I have everything .
Money , position , jewels , servants .
I can play the piano and speak French .
- What more could a woman ask ?
- Oh , Lily , Lily .
Come away with me .
I can give you the one thing you haven 't got .
Love ?
- I have that , too !
- Oh , you hate him .
- My husband , yes .
- What ?
- Are you surprised that I have a lover ?
- That 's not true .
Oh , isn 't it ?
There 's his house .
- I don 't believe it .
- Oh , don 't you ?
It doesn 't matter .
- I 'm going to him now .
- Lily , Lily . Why are you pretending ?
You 're lying .
You 're lying !
You have no lover except me .
It 's me that you love . Me !
You ?
Love you ?
Anything - Anybody but you !
You see if I am lying ! You 'll see !
Baroness !
Well ?
- Close those shutters .
I can hardly believe it !
You 've come .
You 've come to me .
- You love me ?
- Love ? Yes , love .
That 's what I 've come for .
Love .
Lily , my darling .
I 've dreamed of this .
I 've hoped for it .
Milord !
Milord !
There 's a fire .
- There 's a fire in the lodge !
- What ? There 's a fire , milord . In the lodge .
Fire ?
Well , put it out , why don 't you ?
Get him out of here .
Give us a hand .
Are you all right ?
Leave us .
- Fool !
- What ?
You 've disgraced your husband publicly .
He 'll kill you for this !
Come on .
- Where are you taking me ?
- I 'm taking you out of here .
Yes , out of here .
You stay there .
There 's a train in about an hour .
If you 'll write me care of General Delivery at the village , I 'll send you your things .
Thanks .
- Th-They told me !
They told me !
Where is she ? - Sh-She 's gone !
Gone ?
I 'll kill her , the -
Yes , kill her !
And then hear them laughing at you !
- " The old fool !
The lecherous old - "
- Oh , stop !
I 'm waiting . " The old fool who married a - out of his class , and then couldn 't keep her . "
Go on .
Kill her on the high road ! Go on ! Go on !
- Twelve pfenniger .
- Not twelve . Ten .
You keep this book six days .
That 's twelve .
Five days I keep that book .
You couldn 't read a book in five days , Mrs Schwarzbrod .
Even in six , you must have skipped most of it .
I pay you ten and no more .
You will pay me the -
Oh , very well , Mrs Schwarzbrod .
Give me the ten . We 'll make it up next time . Ten is all I owe !
Any news ?
Aren 't you sick of asking me that ?
I 've looked everywhere .
Even been down to the village where she lived .
- Not a trace .
- How much more time are you going to waste on this business ?
I don 't know where else to look .
Have you tried the gutter ?
That 's where girls like her end up !
- Oh , very , very much .
Marvellous , marvellous .
- Lily .
Lily ! Fritz is really a marvellous dancer .
Oh , now Marie , you know -
Don 't paw me in public , Gansfleisch . It isn 't nice .
Oh , did you hear that ?
Marie wants to be nice .
- I am nice .
- Lily 's the one who knows what 's nice .
- Eh , Lily ?
- Give me some more champagne .
- You 're coming to my apartment later , Lily ?
- No . - But you promised .
- I 've changed my mind .
I said no !
What 's the matter with you ?
You go along laughing and singing like everybody else ... - then suddenly , you freeze up like this , and for no reason .
- You bore me .
- Oh , come , come , Lily .
- Don 't tell me men are human , are they , Lily ?
- They 're the only animals that have money and buy champagne .
That 's right .
Good evening , sir .
- Good evening .
I , uh , I want a table , please .
Listen , Lily - " Johnny . " That 's for you .
- Come on .
Be a good girl .
- Please , Lily . - Do , Lily .
Johnny When will your birthday be
Reserve that night for me
Just me and you
Johnny We 'll disconnect the phone
And when we 're all alone
We 'll have a lot to do
Oh , Johnny
I 've got to celebrate
And I can hardly wait
Until we do
Johnny I hope you realize That there 's a big surprise In store for you
Johnny I need your sympathy
There 's something wrong with me
I can 't say no
Johnny All night I long for you
And I 'm so strong for you
You make me feel so weak
Oh , Johnny You know I can 't refuse
What have I got to lose
Come on , let 's go
Johnny What are you waiting for
I need a kiss or two
Or maybe more
- That 's the girl .
- Fine , fine .
I want to talk to you .
- Oh , do you ?
Go ahead .
- Alone . - Look here !
This is a private party .
- Oh , I beg your pardon , sir .
Excuse me .
I 'll be back .
- Yes ?
- Lily , where have you been ?
I 've looked everywhere for you .
Now you 've found me .
So what ?
- I want you to come with me .
- Where ?
Oh , anywhere .
Anywhere out of here . I must talk to you .
We have nothing to say to each other .
- Besides , I have an engagement .
- Oh , forget your engagement and come with me .
Have you got a cigarette ?
- What 's your name ?
- Lily . Now , Lily , don 't irritate me with silly prejudices .
I see you as an artist .
You must believe that , Lily .
I mean - Well , I mean , y-you must believe that .
Yes , I think I believe that .
She 's still the same .
She 's a fool .
What is she waiting for ?
What is she listening for ?
What a fool I was .
Remember how ashamed I was to take my clothes off ?
I remember .
A silly country girl , always chattering about love .
No wonder you got tired of me .
I never got tired of you .
I 've always wanted to have you back .
Well , I 'm back .
For tonight .
Lily , Lily , please .
Please ! One makes mistakes .
One does things . Heaven knows why .
I-I was wrong . But , Lily , need I suffer forever for one mistake ?
I want you back .
I want you back as we used to be .
As we used to be ?
That 's funny .
There was a young girl once who came up those stairs ... who loved you with all her heart , all her soul .
But she has nothing to do with me .
There she is !
The Song of Songs .
Don 't you remember ?
" I sleep , but my heart waketh . It is the voice of my beloved . "
No . " I sought him who my soul loved . " I sought him , but I found him not .
" I called him , but he gave me no answer .
" The watchmen that went about the city found me .
" They smote me , and they wounded me .
" The keepers of the wall took away my veil from me .
They took away my veil from me . "
- Lily , Lily , Lily .
I hurt you and I 've been punished .
Oh , can 't you forgive me ?
I 've never stopped loving you !
Then you love somebody who 's dead .
I 'm dead , do you hear ?
I am dead !
What right has she to live ?
What right has she to live ?
It 's all right , my dear .
It 's all right .
Let it go .
We 'll begin again here .
Do you remember long ago , when we climbed a hill into the sky ?
Well , we 'll climb again now , and find the sky perhaps .

After the holidays , back to school
He 's dead !
No larking about this year !
Think so ?
Hey , Kid Beans !
We had a dead guy with us
Behave yourself Caussat !
I shall bring Rene Tabard in the morning : he 's homesick
He was dead
No kidding , see for yourself
I 'm the new master
Huguet
Rene Tabard : absent , staying with his parents until tomorrow
Good night , housemaster
To the foot of my bed , Dupont !
Who 's there ?
Caussat ...
Bruel ...
Colin
Where 's Dupont ?
I didn 't call you three but now you can stay here until eleven
I 've got to go sir !
Can he go sir ?
Sir , he 's got to go !
Go on , don 't worry about that fool
Are you there , Caussat , Bruel and Colin ?
Go back to bed
Keep quiet , or he 'll drop dead
Up !
Up !
Quickly now !
Bruel , Caussat , Colin ... zero forconduct , detention on Sunday
Late as usual Bruel
Hurry along there !
Do you want a black mark for conduct ?
BOYS IN CONSPIRACY
Here 's the plan :
the conspiracy is ready
We 're in detention , so we hide in the attic
Caussat knows where to get food
What 's Tabard looking at ?
Watch out , teacher !
Oh Huguet 's a good guy
So , on the Day , we hoist the flag
What about ammunition ?
To your places !
Get a move on !
Someone 's pinched my chocolate
He 's been snooping again
Been snooping again has he ?
Give me your glue-pots
Watch this
Give me some paper from the drawer
The ink ... and a pen
Isn 't she a beauty ?
Give me that
To your places
Caussat and Colin , bring me your algebra books
No , don 't bother ;
you 're in detention on Sunday
The Headmaster is here
Please come to my study , Housemaster
Our Commemoration Day is nigh isn 't that so ?
I want no trouble , no larking about
I mean Bruel , Caussat and Colin ... isn 't that so ?
As for Huguet , what you tell me is most agitating
And finally , Housemaster , you tell me Tabard and Bruel are behaving unnaturally
Do you realize the immensity of our moral responsibility ?
Huguet is back alone ?
What about the boys ?
It 's intolerable
Together again
It 's unwholesome , Housemaster They must be watched
Sit down
I might almost be your father , child
At your age , there are things ...
isn 't that so ?
Bruel , I mean , is older than you ...
Your sensibility , and then his ...
isn 't that so ?
Neuropaths ... psychopaths and who knows what else ?
Come and sit beside me
Colin and Caussat to the visitors ' room
Do you want to be kept in ?
I have to spend Sundays in the kitchen with mother
You can visit your tarts
SUNDAY , CAUSSAT AT HIS GUARDIAN 'S
COLIN WITH MA BEANS , HIS MOTHER
Come and look , Tabard
Give Tabard the chocolate
He 's no traitor
Caussat should have let him into the plot because I say so
In any case , he 's got a hiding place
He 'll help us .
He doesn 't like teachers any more than we do
Yes , Housemaster , beans again Always beans !
I can 't give the boys beans every day
Beans again !
Down with Ma Beans !
Tabard 's got a hiding place He has ?
Where ?
Well , if you don 't know , shut up !
Bruel wants him to join Tabard 's a sissy
No , the Head had him up for something
He 's a sissy , anyway .
What good is he ?
How very witty
But I don 't care for all that at all , not at all
Well , my lad , aren 't we taking notes this morning ?
That 's better
I was only saying ...
Bugger off ... you shit
Tabard
My boy , the disciplinary committee has agreed ... under pressure from your soft-hearted teacher ...
Such magnanimity , Mr Viot ... out of consideration for your family and concern for you and in view of the celebration of our Commemoration Day tomorrow to excuse your behaviour
Especially as you have , so to speak offered your apologies
Apologies which are worthless unless repeated before your peers
We are waiting
Come now , what do you want to say ?
Sir , I say the teacher is a shit !
War is declared !
Down with teachers !
Up with revolution !
Liberty or Death ! |
Our flag must be raised !
Stand firm tomorrow !
We 'll fight with rotten old books , tincans and smelly boots !
The ammo 's in the attic !
We 'll bombard the old Commemoration Day dummies !
The next morning , fatigue is the quartet 's accomplice
The boys have barricaded themselves in the attic .
It 's unprecedented
Governor , what an honour
The Governor is seated
This is terrible
" Mr. and Mrs. Alison , Car 96 , Compartment ' F'
Orient Express , Budapest , Visegrad . "
Darling !
Peter .
Aren 't you hungry ?
No , darling .
Are you ? No , of course not .
Are you sure ?
I 'm starved .
So am I. I didn 't eat a bite at luncheon .
Well , neither did I.
Whoever eats anything at a wedding luncheon ?
They make the food out of papier-mâché .
My salad had been used four or five times this week .
Shall we dine in , Mrs. Alison ?
You mean here in the compartment ?
Yeah .
Excuse me , sir , lady .
A terrible mistake has occurred .
They have sold space in your compartment to a gentleman .
It is terrible .
Well ? You are going only to Visegrad which we reach at 2 : 00 .
Might you , perhaps , make room for this gentleman ?
Do please forgive this intrusion .
It is not necessary to make it so important .
You need not disturb these people .
I can make myself quite comfortable in the passageway .
Oh .
Oh , we are only going as far as Visegrad . You 're entirely welcome to share this compartment if you wish .
Very kind .
Thank you .
Sorry .
That 's all right .
Sorry I frightened you , darling .
It is , after all , better to be frightened than to be crushed .
Well , I 'm Peter Alison .
this is Mrs. Alison .
Oh , it is a very great pleasure . I 'm Dr. Vitus Werdegast .
So you are going to Visegrad ?
Yes , and to Gömbös by bus .
Gömbös is very beautiful .
I , too , am going very near there .
For the sport ?
Perhaps .
I go to visit an old friend .
May I ?
Certainly .
I beg your indulgence , my friend .
18 years ago , I left a girl so like your lovely wife to go to war .
For Kaiser and country , you know .
She was my wife .
Have you ever heard of Kurgaal ?
It is a prison below Amsk on Lake Baikal .
Many men have gone there .
Few have returned .
I have returned .
After 15 years I have returned .
Go ahead .
My servant is coming .
Take me to Engineer Poelzig 's house .
It is too bad about the rain .
It 's very unusual .
This road was built by the Austrian Army .
All of this country was one of the greatest battlefields of the war .
Tens of thousands of men died here .
The ravine down there was piled 12 deep with dead and wounded men .
The little river below was swollen red , a raging torrent of blood .
That high hill yonder where Engineer Poelzig now lives , was the site of Fort Marmorus .
He built his home on its very foundation .
Marmorus , the greatest graveyard in the world .
The driver is dead .
Engineer Poelzig ?
Herr Poelzig has retired .
Engineer Poelzig will be expecting me .
I 'm Dr. Werdegast .
We 've had a bad accident .
Awaken Herr Poelzig at once and take us somewhere where I can dress the lady 's injury .
A man was killed .
Telephone the gendarmerie at Visegrad and inform them .
Dr. Werdegast has arrived .
There is no need to worry .
I 'm sure that after a good night 's sleep , she will be quite all right .
It has been a long time , Hjalmar .
The years have been kind to you .
An accident on the road below .
We are all very fortunate to be alive .
Mr. and Mrs. Alison are going to Gömbös .
Mrs. Alison is slightly injured .
I took the liberty of bringing them here .
Of course .
She will sleep now .
You sold Marmorus to the Russians .
Scurried away in the night and left us to die .
Is it to be wondered at that you should choose this place to build your house ?
A masterpiece of construction built upon the ruins of the masterpiece of destruction .
The masterpiece of murder .
The murderer of 10,000 men returns to the place of his crime .
Those who died were fortunate .
I was taken a prisoner to Kurgaal .
Kurgaal where the soul is killed slowly .
Fifteen years I 've rotted in the darkness .
Waited .
Not to kill you , to kill your soul slowly .
Where is my wife Karen and my daughter ?
Karen ?
Well , what do you mean ?
I mean you told Karen I had been killed . I found out that much in Budapest .
I mean you always wanted her .
In the days at Salzburg , before the war , always , from the first time you saw her .
I mean that after you saved your own hide and left us all to die in Marmorus you went to Karen and induced her to go to America with you .
I traced the two of you there and to Spain and to South America and finally here .
Where is she ?
Vitus , you are mad .
Where is she ?
Sorry if I 'm intruding .
Not at all .
Do come in , we were just going to have something to drink .
Now perhaps you will join us ?
And what would you like ?
Oh , uh , whiskey .
This is a very interesting house you have here , Poelzig .
Has an atmosphere , kind of , uh ...
It is indeed hard to describe .
As hard to describe as life or , or death .
It may well be an atmosphere of death .
This place was built on the ruins of that same Fort Marmorus that our unfortunate friend , the driver , described so vividly .
Herr Poelzig commanded Marmorus during the last years of the war .
He is perhaps sentimental about this spot .
And as for the house being interesting an architectural chef-d 'oeuvre , it could not be otherwise .
Engineer Poelzig is one of Austria 's greatest architects .
Dr. Werdegast is one of Hungary 's greatest psychiatrists .
Allow me to introduce myself more fully .
I 'm Peter Alison , one of America 's greatest writers of unimportant books .
Oh , you are an author , a novelist ?
Uh , what kind of things do you do ?
Mysteries .
To you , my friend , to your charming wife , and to love .
Are you all right , Joan ?
I thought you were asleep .
You are frightened , Doctor ?
You are our host .
At your service , madame .
You must be indulgent to Dr. Werdegast 's weakness .
He is the unfortunate victim of one of the commoner phobias but in an extreme form .
He has an intense and all-consuming horror of cats .
Come , darling , you must go back to bed .
You 're not strong enough .
He is quite right . You had a severe shock .
You must sleep .
Good night , gentlemen .
Joan .
Forgive my presumption but I must emphasize the extreme importance of Mrs. Alison having complete quiet sleep .
I gave her a very powerful narcotic , I 'm sure it will be effective soon .
Her condition is not sufficiently serious to be cause for alarm but it is decidedly delicate .
Rest is the important thing .
What curious changes it made in her . You must have noticed it ?
It is perhaps the narcotic .
Hyoscine affects certain people very oddly . One cannot be sure .
Sometimes these cases take strange forms .
The victim becomes , in a sense , mediumistic a vehicle for all the intangible forces in operation around her .
It sounds like a lot of supernatural baloney to me .
Supernatural , perhaps .
Baloney , perhaps not .
There are many things under the sun .
I shall show you your rooms .
Strange about the cat .
Joan seemed so curiously affected when you killed it .
That was coincidence , I think .
However , certain ancient books say that the black cat is the living embodiment of evil .
At death that evil enters into the nearest living thing .
It is -
The black cat does not die .
Those same books , if I am not mistaken teach that the black cat is deathless .
Deathless as evil .
It is the origin of the common superstition of the cat with nine lives .
You will sleep here , Vitus .
Thank you .
Good night .
Good night , gentlemen .
Good night , Vitus .
Sleep well .
An extremely interesting and capable man . Yes .
I hope you will be comfortable . Thank you .
My room adjoins Mrs. Alison 's .
You would like to be near her ?
Yes . Thank you .
Do you mind if I keep this door open ?
I 'd sleep in a cold sweat if you didn 't .
You know , this is a very tricky house .
Kind of place where I like to have company .
So this guy Poelzig is a great architect ?
Yes .
One of the greatest .
Well , I suppose we 've got to have architects , too .
If I wanted to build a nice , cozy , unpretentious insane asylum , he 'd be the man for it .
You think Mrs. Alison will be well enough to go on to Gömbös in the morning ?
I think so .
That will be swell .
Now , Vitus , we have something to settle , we two .
You were seeking me , Hjalmar ?
I beg your pardon .
Where is my wife ?
Very well , Vitus .
I shall take you to her .
Next time I go to Niagara Falls .
You will come alone , Vitus .
Wait here .
And this was the entrance to the gun turrets .
Don 't you recognize it ?
I can still sense death in the air .
There is still death in the air .
It is just as much undermined today as ever .
And this is the old chart room for the long-range guns .
The guns are gone , but the charts are still here .
Now you see , Vitus , I have cared for her tenderly and well .
You will find her almost as beautiful as when you last saw her .
She died two years after the war .
How ?
Of pneumonia .
She was never very strong , you know .
A - and the child , our daughter ?
Dead .
And why is she ...
Why is she like this ?
Is she not beautiful ?
I wanted to have her beauty always .
I loved her , too , Vitus .
Lies .
All lies , Hjalmar .
You killed her .
You killed her as I am about to kill you !
Come , Vitus .
Are we men or are we children ?
Of what use are all these melodramatic gestures ?
You say your soul was killed , that you have been dead all these years .
And what of me ?
Did we not both die here in Marmorus 15 years ago ?
Are we any the less victims of the war than those whose bodies were torn asunder ?
Are we not both the living dead ?
And now you come to me playing at being an avenging angel childishly thirsting for my blood .
We understand each other too well .
We know too much of life .
We shall play a little game , Vitus .
A game of death , if you like .
But under any circumstances we shall have to wait until these people have gone .
Until we are alone .
Until tomorrow .
What is it , Hjalmar ?
Oh , it 's nothing .
Only an accident on the road below .
I want you to stay in this room all day tomorrow , Karen .
You are the very core and meaning of my life .
No one shall take you from me , not even Vitus , not even your father .
Not yet , Thamal .
Put that away .
We will bide our time .
Other lives are involved .
This place is so undermined with dynamite that the slightest mistake by one of us could cause the destruction of all .
Until I tell you different , you are his servant , not mine .
Peter ?
Good morning .
Have you slept well ?
I must examine the dressing .
Dressing ?
I don 't remember .
The bus .
We were in the bus and we fell ...
I don 't remember anything after that .
You don 't ?
Where is Peter ?
Is he all right ?
He is not in his room .
He is perhaps at breakfast .
Will you sit down ?
What happened , Doctor ?
What is this place ?
This is the home of my friend , Herr Poelzig .
You will forgive this intrusion ?
I came to enquire after the health of my charming guest .
This is Engineer Poelzig , our host .
Where is Peter , uh , Mr. Alison ?
I think he is breakfasting .
I 'll send for him .
Are you worried , Vitus ?
About myself ? No .
The girl ?
Perhaps .
Oh .
You are interested ?
Maybe .
I thought so .
Well , I 'm not .
Only spiritually .
Spiritually ?
Tonight is the dark of the moon .
And we shall gather , and ...
You 'd better come , Vitus .
The ceremony will interest you .
Don 't pretend , Hjalmar .
There was nothing spiritual in your eyes when you looked at that girl .
You plan to keep her here .
Perhaps .
I intend to let her go .
Is that a challenge , Vitus ?
Yes , if you dare to fight it out alone .
Do you dare play chess with me , for her ?
Yes .
I will even play you chess for her .
Provided if I win , they are free to go .
You won 't win , Vitus .
Hurt ?
Not a bit .
What happened last night ?
Did I do anything silly ?
Silly ?
How could you do anything that wasn 't entirely lovely ?
Do you feel well enough to leave , darling ?
I 'd feel well enough to leave if I didn 't feel well enough to leave .
I don 't like this place .
You don 't like it .
You haven 't had breakfast yet .
I don 't like Mr. Pigslow , or whatever his name is .
Poelzig .
Hurry up and get dressed , darling .
I 'll explain everything to Mr. Poelzig .
All right .
Come down when you 're ready . Mmm-hmm .
He wants to know our version of the accident . An American ?
And , uh , will you tell me about the accident , please ?
Well , Mrs. Alison , Dr. Werdegast and I were on our way to Gömbös -
Gömbös ?
It is my home .
What a beautiful place .
What grandeur , what charm .
You have chosen very wisely , sir .
Gömbös is the pearl of the Carpathian Mountains -
I beg your pardon , sir .
Gömbös , it 's very nice , in its way .
But it cannot compare with Pisthyan .
Pisthyan is my home .
There is a place .
Sporty , if you want to sport .
Quiet , if you want quiet .
Gaiety , if you want gaiety .
Pisthyan is God 's gift to young lovers . It 's -
Pisthyan used to be all right 10 , 15 years ago , but now ...
Gömbös is the place .
Sir , you are carrying it a little bit too far .
How about the accident , Lieutenant ?
I think it was due almost entirely to the rain .
Part of the road gave way , the bus tipped over and crashed . That 's all .
Very well .
May I have your names ?
Werdegast , Dr. Vitus Werdegast .
Peter Alison .
You gentlemen can be reached here ?
Oh , uh , you 've been very kind , Herr Poelzig .
But Mrs. Alison and I must get back down to Visegrad .
You see , Mrs. Alison must communicate with her parents in Vienna .
May we ride back with you to Visegrad ?
I , uh , should be very happy to accommodate you .
Unfortunately , we of the gendarmerie go about on bicycles .
It would be , uh , very inconvenient for Madame .
I 'm afraid it is impossible to get a train out of Visegrad until the express goes through at 11 : 00 tonight .
I shall be most happy to send you down then .
Thank you , gentlemen .
I should be very sorry if I had inconvenienced you .
And I shall be very sorry , too if you do not decide to go on to Gömbös .
Pisthyan .
Dr. Werdegast , I feel sure that Mrs. Alison is well enough to go on to -
I beg your pardon , but do you play chess ? No .
I used to play a very good hand of poker .
Well , if you don 't mind , I think we 'll go on with our game .
Please don 't think we don 't appreciate your hospitality , Herr Poelzig .
Mrs. Alison is still quite shaken up from the accident , you know , and feels she wants to get back to Vienna .
Now , if you could send us down to Visegrad , I 'm sure we could hire a car there that would take us on to Budapest , or at least far enough to get a decent train . But of course .
I shall be very sorry to see you go but if you and Mrs. Alison think best , why ...
I want you to take Mr. and Mrs. Alison down to Visegrad .
Now , you realize , of course , that this is against the advice of Dr. Werdegast .
And you will have to assume the full responsibility .
Oh , but I 'm quite sure she 'll be all right .
Then we will go on with our game .
I 'm sorry , sir , the car is out of commission .
It will take some time to repair it .
You see , I-I use the car so seldom myself .
I 'm afraid you 'll just have to be patient .
Then may I use your telephone ?
I 'll telephone the hotel in Visegrad and ask them to send a car . Of course .
Of course .
Take the gentleman to the telephone .
Did you get the hotel ?
No .
The phone 's dead .
Did you hear that , Vitus ?
The phone is dead .
Even the phone is dead .
Come along , Joan , we 're getting out of here , fast .
What happened ?
Never mind , darling .
Just stay close to me and don 't say anything .
We 're leaving , if we have to walk to Visegrad . Oh , never mind about the baggage .
We 'll send for that later .
The main thing is to go and go quickly .
Someone 's taken my automatic .
Checkmate .
You lose , Vitus .
We are leaving .
Open the door .
I hope you won 't carry this too far , Hjalmar .
Child , I hope you 're not afraid of me ?
Where is Peter ?
What have you done with him ? I ?
Surely you don 't think I -
It was your servant who struck him down . Where is he ?
Where is he ?
Please , child , listen to me .
We are all in danger .
Poelzig is a mad beast , I know . I know , I have seen the proof .
He took Karen , my wife , murdered her and murdered my child .
And you let him live .
I await my time . It shall be soon .
Very soon .
Until then , I must do his bidding . That is why even my servant obeys him .
Did you ever hear of Satanism , the worship of the devil , of evil ?
Herr Poelzig is the great modern priest of that ancient cult and tonight , dark of the moon , the rites of Lucifer are celebrated .
And if I am not mistaken , he intends you to play a part in that ritual . A very important part .
Dear child , be brave no matter how hopeless it all seems .
Be brave .
It is your only chance .
Who are you ?
I 've never seen you before , have I ?
No , I-I don 't think you have .
I am Karen , Madame Poelzig . Karen ?
Not Karen Werdegast ?
Yes , yes , how did you know my name ?
Well , I-I know your father .
Oh , no , you are mistaken .
My father died in prison .
Herr Poelzig married my mother .
She died when I was very young . And he married you ?
You 're his wife ?
Yes .
Karen , listen to me .
Your father is not dead .
I know , I know , he 's here in this very house .
He 's come for you .
Karen , do you understand me ? Your father has come for you .
Don 't , Hjalmar !
Please !
Dark of the moon .
'Tis the night .
We better hurry . The guests will soon be here for the ceremony .
Peter ! Please let me go ! Please !
Don 't !
Don 't !
Please ! No !
No !
Stop struggling , little fool . There is a way out .
Come , this way .
Peter , where did he go ?
Never mind him .
But you will be dead soon if you do not come quickly .
And Karen ? Karen is dead .
No , I mean Karen , your daughter .
Madame Poelzig . What do you mean ?
She is alive , here in this house .
She is Poelzig 's wife .
Where is she ?
Where is Karen , my daughter ?
Joan .
Do you know what I am going to do to you now ?
No ?
Did you ever see an animal skinned , Hjalmar ? That 's what I 'm going to do to you now .
Tear the skin from your body , slowly , bit by bit .
How does it feel to hang on your own embalming rack , Hjalmar ?
No ! No ! Joan !
The key .
The key .
Let me help you . Stand back , Werdegast .
Get away , Werdegast .
He wanted to help us . You poor fool .
I only tried to help . Now go .
Please !
Go .
It 's the red switch , isn 't it , Hjalmar ?
The red switch ignites the dynamite .
Five minutes .
Marmorus , you and I and your rotten cult will be no more .
It has been a good game .
Please stop !
Visegrad , Budapest .
Darling , here 's a review of Triple Murder . " In Triple Murder ,
" Mr. Alison 's latest mystery thriller
" We feel , however , that Mr. Alison has , in a sense ,
" overstepped the bounds on the matter of credibility . " These things could never ,
" by the furthest stretch of the imagination , actually happen . " We could wish that Mr. Alison
" would confine himself to the possible instead of having his melodramatic imagination run away with him . "
Oh , the Queen !
Where 's the Queen ?
The Queen is gone !
Cleopatra !
Pothinos .
Here is your new kingdom , Cleopatra .
Here you can command the asps and scorpions of the desert .
Maybe they will bow low and whisper " Majesty . "
If my hands were free , I 'd kill you .
But I am more kind .
I leave you this mighty schoolmaster . Set him free .
Apollodorus .
With his help , you might reach Syria over there .
And the way to Egypt ?
Is death .
Set foot in Alexandria again , and I 'll kill you .
I have heard that Caesar comes to Alexandria , Prime Minister .
I 'm returning to meet with Caesar , Philosopher .
Goodbye , Cleopatra , Queen of the Desert .
You 'll find , to your sorrow , I 'm still Queen of Egypt .
Untie me .
You understand , my Queen , he returns to meet with Caesar .
Is this a time to talk of Romans ?
I 've had no breakfast .
I 'm hungry .
So is Caesar hungry .
For Egypt .
You see how wise your father was ... to make Rome the protector of you and your brother , King Ptolemy ?
They 've got you out of the way to deal with your brother alone .
They can handle him .
I 'll get back to Alexandria .
Majesty , it 's death .
It 's certain death to go .
How old is this Caesar ?
I am told you have arrived at a conclusion , Caesar .
I have .
Is it your judgment to support the cause of Ptolemy or his sister ?
Your young King Ptolemy has raised an army ... to crush his sister , Queen Cleopatra .
It must be disbanded .
As the general of that army , suppose I refuse ?
Well , we 'll go into that if you do , but I don 't think you will .
Good model .
Build it .
By what authority do you judge the destiny of Egypt ?
I am here to see that there is peace in Egypt .
With a Roman army waiting at the border ?
Excellence , would you not enter into a treaty with the King ... if the Queen has disappeared ?
Has she ?
Rumor says that Cleopatra has fled to Syria .
She must have .
She 's not here .
Maybe she was assisted in her flight .
Who can tell ?
Who can tell ?
Well , from what I hear of her , small loss to Egypt .
In such a case , your king would be sole ruler .
Under Roman guidance .
And you would pay to Rome each year one million denarii .
One million denarii !
One million denarii !
And 10 shiploads of Egyptian corn for the unemployed in Rome .
Ten ships of corn .
Ten thousand votes in Rome for Caesar .
A hundred thousand maybe .
Who can tell ?
Well , I 'm waiting .
Agreed .
Let him sign it .
A letter .
Julius Caesar to the Senate , Rome .
A rug of Persia .
A gift for Caesar from Nahigian the merchant .
We give nothing to Romans here .
Did you say for Caesar ?
Pass on .
What do you think you own , the Earth ?
Yes .
And we have made a settlement with Egypt whereby we support young Ptolemy as King .
Your seal , Excellence .
Against the sedition of his sister , Cleopatra ... who , by all reports , has fled to Syria .
A gift for Caesar , fit even for his eyes .
Thanks .
Give him something .
The wax is ready for your seal , Caesar .
The rug , Excellence .
Will you receive it ?
What ?
Yes , yes , put it down .
Excellence , the wax is cooling .
Observe , Caesar .
A most unusual design .
What ?
Well !
Greetings to Caesar from Egypt .
A very amusing joke .
Very good .
But I 'm too busy .
Huh ? What 's the matter ?
Tell him , Pothinos .
Tell him what 's the matter , if your lying tongue can find the words .
I am Cleopatra . Huh ?
Yes , a good joke .
She is Cleopatra , and I am Caesar .
Come on . I 'll take her away .
No , you won 't .
Enough of this .
Caesar , you must listen .
He abducted me to the desert and left me there to die .
But nothing could stop me from greeting you .
Are you to be fooled by a ...
No , I am not to be fooled .
It 's dangerous to lie to me , Pothinos .
But , Caesar , I thought it would be best all around if she ...
Then you did lie to me .
So you would match wits with Caesar ?
Oh , no .
All right , run along now .
The seal , Caesar . Not yet .
This quarrel with your brother will be settled in Rome .
That 's all .
Withdraw .
Come , Majesty .
Enough .
Before I go , one word more ?
Well ? Well ?
It seems strange to see you working .
I 've always pictured you either fighting or loving .
Well , I have had some experience with fighting .
But none with loving , I suppose .
Well , none with pretty little queens .
Oh . That was nice .
And now , with your permission , I 'll go to work again .
The dispatches from Gaul .
What ...
Oh , run along .
If I leave you now , I 'll be killed .
Pothinos has sworn to kill me .
Pothinos has said that if I ever set foot in Alexandria again , he 'd kill me .
The map of Gaul .
Well !
He usually does those things , you know .
Can 't you see I 'm busy ?
India .
Of course .
Of course I know you 're very busy ... but I thought you might like to talk about India .
What ?
What about India ?
It 's the treasure house of the East .
With enough gold to ...
Oh , but you 're much too busy .
We 'll talk about it tomorrow . If I 'm still alive .
What about India ?
Well , the road to India lies through Egypt .
And the Queen of Egypt , allied with Caesar could ...
Why didn 't you say that right away ?
My tongue was bewitched by Caesar .
The man in you seems even mightier than the general .
Egypt .
Sit down .
Pretty girl .
Charming .
Now .
Now , what do you know of India ?
Oh , nothing much .
But its gold would pay Caesar 's legions for a century .
Well ! Now that 's something to talk about .
Yes , but not here .
Come to my chambers and dine .
We 'll make such plans .
Are your plans for India or me ?
Both .
Shouldn 't a queen choose for her confidant a king ?
The word " king " is not well-liked in Rome .
Caesar takes what he wants .
Flavius .
My own guard for the Queen 's safety .
I had to walk miles across the desert to the sea ... to find the fishing boat that brought me to you .
But just seeing you is magic , immortal Caesar .
That 's quite a speech .
Your tongue is no longer bewitched by Caesar , eh ?
No .
It 's my heart now .
That 's strange , too .
I 've never loved before .
Love ?
If you 'd bring true the dreams of empire that fill your pretty head ... leave love alone .
I can 't .
It 's too late .
It 's too late .
Will you do something that will make me very happy ?
I am here to make you very happy .
Then drive Pothinos out of Egypt .
Drive him ?
Where ?
Into the desert where he drove me . No .
I came to talk of India , not the quarrels of Egypt .
But I am Egypt .
If I make you so .
I was wrong .
Let 's not talk at all tonight .
Perhaps there 's nothing to talk about , ever .
You don 't trust me ?
No .
And if I said I really love you , you wouldn 't believe me ?
No .
And if I implored you to marry me , you wouldn 't ?
I 'd have to ask my wife in Rome .
As if you 'd care about that .
Divorce her .
Together we could conquer the world .
Nice of you to include me .
I will be Caesar 's wife and ally .
You rate yourself highly , my child .
So a woman isn 't strong enough to help the mighty Caesar ? Caesar .
Have you ever thought what your life is worth ?
Well , it 's worth a great deal to me .
It must be worth a great deal to others .
Mine is .
And I 'm only the Queen of Egypt ... while Caesar , if he lives , will be Emperor of the world .
If he lives ?
Life is a precious thing , isn 't it ?
I think so .
Hadn 't you better put that javelin down ?
And if a man swears to take the life of another ... death is justice for him .
I think so .
Pothinos .
He came to kill you .
Or you .
Passage to the tombs . I saw his sandal beneath the curtain .
And now am I worth talking to ?
More ...
Well , far more than Pothinos .
Guards !
Take it away .
Let 's not talk anymore .
I picked a flower in Britain once , the color of your eyes .
This is the first morning he 's been late since the day he was born .
Ho , there !
Caesar comes !
Well , well , come on , come on .
Let 's go to work .
Hold that letter to the Senate .
But the agreement with the King 's Prime Minister .
Destroy it .
Even I can 't reach an agreement with a corpse .
The Prime Minister is dead .
Then we deal with the King ?
The Queen .
Cleopatra is sole ruler of Egypt .
And I find that I shall be here longer than I thought .
But the galley , Caesar , is ordered to sail .
When I say so .
A letter to Marc Antony , Rome .
Nobody ever hears from him .
Except Marc Antony .
He gets a letter every week or so .
Is it true that Caesar is really in love ...
Child , child .
But he doesn 't come back to Rome , does he ?
Well , he 's missing a lovely party today .
He doesn 't miss very much any day .
The Queen of Egypt gives parties , too .
You mean Cleopatra ?
Whoa !
What ? Have you heard of Cleopatra ?
Of course .
All kinds of things .
Is she black ?
Calpurnia .
My lady .
How beautiful you are .
Is there anything I can get for you ?
Yes , a little luck .
The loveliest party you 've ever given , Calpurnia .
Thank you , Flora .
Wonderful .
The wife is always the last one to know .
So is the husband , when it comes to that .
They say he 's planning to move the capital to Egypt .
We were talking of the games .
Have you seen the new circus , Calpurnia ?
I haven 't been to the games since Caesar left .
You should enjoy life more , Calpurnia .
Even Caesar 's wife should play .
Why not ?
She 's above suspicion . We waited two hours for you yesterday .
What kept you ?
Oh , I 'm sorry .
I 'll explain it later .
When is Caesar coming back ?
Ever ?
Tullius , I 'm so sorry to hear about your brother 's exile .
I shall ask a pardon for him when Caesar returns .
I hope he grants it .
If Caesar returns .
If Caesar returns .
It 's rumored all over Rome .
It 's been known for days .
If what you say is true , Cassius ... we 're in a desperate situation .
But I can 't believe it .
It is true , Brutus .
I heard with my own ears .
Quiet , Casca .
Let Brutus speak .
The people love you , Brutus .
They love Caesar .
But he would make himself king .
And then , where are we ?
If I had proof of that ... He plans to divorce Calpurnia and marry a queen .
This Cleopatra .
And call himself King of Rome .
Of us .
Emperor of the world .
Was I not born as free as Caesar ?
And you ?
And you ?
Caesar .
He 's everywhere .
Rome is a republic .
It wants no crown .
It will have no king .
Octavia . Hello , dear .
Hello , dear .
Hello , Octavian .
Oh , it 's a delightful party .
Sit down with us a moment .
Where 's Antony ?
Does any wife ever know where her husband is ?
Calpurnia knows where her husband is .
Sit down just for a minute .
You look tired .
Just for a minute .
No news at all from Caesar , eh ?
I don 't expect any .
He 's too busy , Octavian .
Well , he shouldn 't be too busy to write to me .
He writes to Marc Antony .
Why Antony and not me ?
Why ?
Tell me why .
Wouldn 't you think he 'd know the last people you write to are relatives ?
But I 'm more than Caesar 's nephew , I 'm his heir .
You 're my brother , and Marc 's my husband .
I know you both pretty well .
And if I were Caesar , I would certainly write to Marc Antony .
Ho , there !
Marc Antony comes !
Oh , Marc Antony 's here !
Wait , wait , wait .
I have news .
News ? Another letter from Caesar ?
More than a letter .
Caesar is entering Rome .
Caesar is entering Rome !
Marc Antony , please .
I must see you for one day .
No , no , not now .
I came to get Calpurnia . Slave .
Take them .
Did you all hear ?
Yes .
Well , well , and who is this pretty maid ?
Hello , darling .
" Hello , darling " ?
You 'd think she had met me before .
Or is it my fame she seeks ?
Oh , he hasn 't been to bed .
He always talks like this when he hasn 't ...
Sleep . I 'm above sleep , my beloved wife .
I 'm glad you 're above something .
Ah , in his usual gay mood .
But , come on .
We must hurry .
You ready , Calpurnia ?
I 'm not going .
Sorry ?
I shall wait for my husband here .
What 's the matter ?
Nothing .
Oh , yes , there is .
There 's a great deal the matter .
And I 'm in no hurry to watch Caesar 's triumphal entry into Rome .
Why , what 's the matter with you ?
Do you take us all for fools ?
Don 't you think we know what Caesar plans to do ?
And what does Caesar plan to do ?
Well , go and listen to him in the Senate tomorrow ... and you 'll learn what he plans to do .
We don 't have to .
It 's no music to our ears to hear him desert us .
He 's drunk with Egypt , and he 's deserting us .
Antony !
Antony !
No !
Octavian , no !
Antony ...
I know .
Caesar !
Hail !
Hail , Caesar !
I thought she gave money .
Her dress is all gold .
She 's too gorgeous .
In the shape of a sphinx .
But she is beautiful .
She is .
Oh , I don 't know .
Oh , but look at all those chariots !
Caesar .
Beware the Ides of March .
One date is as good as another for a funeral .
Beware .
You may go now . We need nothing more .
Well , Brutus , was I right about ...
Be careful .
Must we whisper what all Rome growls ?
Yes , I believe .
Now that I know he 's divorcing Calpurnia to marry her .
That might be his private affair ... but tomorrow he 'll force the Senate to declare him Emperor and King .
And present Cleopatra to them as ... Queen .
Our Queen , Brutus . Our Queen .
No , Rome cannot be turned into another Orient ... with golden thrones for a king and queen .
But I suppose he 'll sway the Senate as he always has .
Oh , no , he won 't .
We 'll greet Caesar before he greets the Senate ... and a little blood will be spilled for Rome .
So today you go before the Senate to ...
Well , all I can say is I think it 's your first mistake .
All I can say is I don 't care what you think .
You always did care what I thought .
You always agreed . Ah .
I don 't hate women for nothing .
Enobarbus speaks .
And speaks well .
What 's this ?
Antony hates women , too ?
Out of their place , I do .
They 've no place amongst men .
They can 't think , and they can 't fight . They 're just playthings for us .
Most of them .
All of them .
A woman 's a woman .
We speak freely to you because we are your friends .
I know that .
You say that the whole idea of this marriage to Cleopatra ... is to capture India and then the world .
Does that sound like you ?
When did you ever ask anyone 's help ?
Anything you wanted , you took .
It 'll be easier to take it this way .
Well .
Easier .
A strange word from Caesar .
Women soften all men .
He sounds like a lover talking .
An Egyptian lover .
That woman 's making an Egyptian out of you .
You bring Egyptian ships and men back with you .
You change the calendar of Rome to Egypt 's .
But you cannot make an Egyptian queen a ruler over Romans .
Words .
Look at the Roman eagle with half the world in his claws ... tamed by a woman .
I 'm leaving for the Senate .
But , Caesar , you ...
Are you coming , Antony ?
No , I 'll take no part in it .
Any man who wants to make a fool of himself over a woman ... can do so , as far as I 'm concerned .
I don 't know what the young man means , but he means it violently .
And I agree with him .
Then you 'd better follow him .
Caesar !
Caesar !
Oh , Caesar .
Oh , you haven 't gone .
Don 't go !
Oh , don 't go .
Don 't go .
Calpurnia .
I 've had a dream , a terrible vision .
I saw a flaming star falling , and it was you , your body dripping blood .
I saw your toga torn by daggers , wet with blood , your blood , my husband .
Oh , please , please don 't leave this house today .
It 's an evil omen .
I know it .
I know it .
Calpurnia , my dear ... the world 's affairs cannot be stopped because you 've had a dream .
Casca the Senator .
Caesar .
Caesar , the Senate waits for you .
No , no , no .
You shall not go .
I 'll keep you here .
Calpurnia has seen a day of evil for me in her dreams .
Perhaps ...
Shall I return and tell the Senate , which waits to offer you the world 's crown ... that they must wait until Calpurnia 's dreams are pleasanter ?
I 'll come .
Oh , no , no , Caesar .
I beg you .
Not for myself but for you .
Oh , please , please , Caesar .
Evil is on every side . I know it .
I know it .
For what I have done , Calpurnia , pardon .
For what I am about to do , courage .
No .
No !
The swan 's feather .
Iras , be careful .
I 'm trying to keep my hand from shaking ... but , Majesty , I 'm so excited .
Majesty .
Majesty .
Royal robes for the Empress of the world .
Up the stairs .
Before the Queen .
And , Majesty , wait until you see them .
They 're beautiful , marvelous .
Take the lid off .
Beautiful !
The Roman Senate will get a thrill today .
Choose , Majesty .
It 's not the Senate I 'm worried about but their fat wives .
Here .
Do you know anything about senators , Charmion ?
Well , we only got here yesterday , Majesty .
Caesar !
My sandals .
Hail , Caesar !
Caesar comes !
I only stopped for a last salute .
Oh , no , wait just a minute .
There 's something I want to tell you .
Too late , my love .
And get dressed .
Get dressed .
I 'll be ready .
But the Senate is waiting .
Let them wait .
I want a moment all alone .
But ...
No , put your arms around me .
Hold me close to you .
I 'm frightened of something .
Frightened ?
What 's the matter ?
I love you so much .
And that frightens you ?
Nothing must happen to you , my Caesar .
Nothing will .
I 'll send for you the moment my speech is done .
You must be ready .
Emperor !
Empress !
He passes here .
Tullius .
Decimus .
Solinus .
Casca .
You , there .
Brutus , beside the column .
Listen !
He must be just arriving .
How long will the speech take ?
He 's sending for me right after .
You 'll be ready .
And how you 'll look .
Do you think you might wear this dress when you get married , too ?
What ?
I was just thinking of the great Caesar trying to unhook it .
Charmion .
Listen .
Listen to the cheers now .
Hail !
Hail , Caesar !
Hail , Caesar !
Caesar , hail !
Caesar , I warned you . The Ides of March .
The Ides of March are here .
But not gone .
Caesar !
Caesar comes !
Ah , Caesar .
A pardon , Caesar , for my brother in exile .
Denied . You tyrant !
Stand back !
Take your hands off me !
Let me get out of here !
Get off me !
You !
You , too , Brutus !
A great day for Rome .
Am I all right ?
Marvelous .
Beautiful .
The senators ' eyes will pop right out of their heads .
Caesar is dead !
What ? Caesar is dead !
Caesar is a traitor to Rome !
His speech is over .
It must be .
I hear the shouting .
Apollodorus , has the messenger come ?
Not yet .
I never saw anything so beautiful .
Let me show you .
How do you like this ?
Gorgeous .
Or do you like this ?
I am only a man .
How can I tell ?
The Queen !
The Queen !
Where 's the Queen ?
Stand !
Stand !
Stop ! Stop !
Caesar has been murdered !
Royal Egypt , Caesar is dead .
How was this ?
By whom ?
I don 't know , but I heard them cry , " Brutus ! Cassius ! "
As I galloped through the streets , I heard them shout :
" Caesar is a traitor to Rome ! "
Where is he ?
Where is Caesar ?
Dead , Majesty .
The body lies at the foot of Pompey 's statue .
No one will touch it .
I will .
Majesty , you cannot .
No , my Queen . No .
Majesty !
Majesty !
They come this way .
They cry for Egypt 's blood !
Man the small boat at the foot of the garden .
# # Come , my Queen .
Come . We must go . We must escape .
They will kill you .
Think of Egypt .
" Think of Egypt " ?
Always Egypt !
But Caesar is dead .
My Emperor .
That dream is gone .
Gone .
Yes , gone .
What do I care for empire now ?
Caesar is dead .
My lover is dead .
He didn 't love you .
You lie !
You lie !
You lie !
Majesty .
It wasn 't in his arms he wanted to hold Egypt .
It was in his treasury .
It 's true .
You were blind .
He didn 't love you .
You were blind .
Blind .
Antony .
Always Antony .
Sit down , Octavian .
Sit down .
That 's all I do , sit .
Well , then sit down .
I won 't sit down !
See , he can 't even sit down .
Antony , Octavian .
Caesar dead only two weeks , and you fill his house with your quarrels .
The Senate has decreed that you both shall rule Rome together ... and that Antony shall avenge the death of Caesar upon the traitors ... and shall punish Egypt .
But why Antony ?
I 'll govern with you if I have to .
But if there 's any fighting to be done , I 'll do it alone .
Alone . You want to do everything alone .
You took advantage of Caesar lying on his funeral pyre ... to gain the public 's support for yourself .
You used my uncle 's dead body to win control ... holding up his bloodstained toga like any playactor ... to make the crowd cheer you .
You , with your , " Friends , Romans , countrymen . "
That 's enough !
Steady .
I accept the Senate 's order . Good .
And you , Octavian ?
Oh , I suppose so .
And how do you propose to punish Egypt ?
I shall write a letter to the Egyptian Queen ... demanding that she meet me in the public square in Tarsus .
A letter ?
The great Marc Antony fights with friendly notes .
Really , Octavian , you must ...
No , it 's all right .
Octavian 's right , for once .
It will be a friendly note .
Well , but I don 't understand .
Friendly ?
I see .
She will think the meeting a friendly discussion ... on Roman and Egyptian affairs .
Yes .
Instead , my legions will be with me in Tarsus on our way to take Egypt by force .
From Tarsus , I shall send Cleopatra to Rome in chains .
That 's more like the real Marc Antony .
We 're approaching Tarsus .
Are we ?
And no plans yet , Cleopatra .
If you fail , it means slavery for Egypt and death for you .
If you had listened to me , at least we 'd have ships and men with us .
Where do we meet Marc Antony ?
In the public square at noon .
Well , why doesn 't she come ?
How should I know ?
Where are the two generals you sent to bring her ?
Waiting for her , I suppose , like you and me and the whole Roman army .
Waiting for a woman .
A woman !
Six hours . While you stand here and do nothing .
Go and get her .
Well , it 's about time .
What ?
Apologize !
I apologize .
Watch your tongue , or I 'll cut it out of you !
Wait here .
I 'll go down to her boat and get her myself .
Stop there !
Who nears the Queen 's barge ?
I 'm Antony of Rome .
You 're late .
Where are my men ?
Oh , Charmion .
Where are the Romans who came here today ? Do you know ?
They 're sleeping , my Queen .
Sleeping ?
What for ?
They 're ... Well , I should say they were a little tired .
You mean a little drunk !
No , awfully drunk .
Come and see .
Get someone to fling them ashore .
We 'll go now . Get ready .
Were you speaking to me ?
Who do you think ?
I sent orders for you to come to the square .
I 'm not used to being disobeyed .
And why should I obey you ?
Your letter said we had things to talk about .
The letter said that we would meet in the public square in Tarsus ... and that 's where we 're going . Oh .
We can 't talk here then ?
No , we cannot talk here .
Talk ?
With all this ?
Oh , how different from your generals .
Well , I guess I must confess everything .
I must tell you why I wanted to meet you here instead of the square .
Well ?
Do you see the way I 'm dressed ?
What about it ?
I 'm dressed to lure you , Antony .
You see all this ?
It was all a plan .
And you know why ?
Because it was my only chance .
Don 't you think I know you 're my enemy , you and your hungry Rome ?
But I suppose it was the most stupid thing I could have done .
Why , do you know I had show after show with which to dazzle you ?
But Antony is not a man to be dazzled if he doesn 't please . No .
What do you care for this , for instance ?
Watch .
I wish you could see your face .
Huh ?
I 'd have more chance with a stone wall .
Will you forgive me for being such a fool ?
I should have known that Antony is not Antony for nothing .
Well , shall we go now ?
Yes , we 'll go .
My wits have failed , and I 'm in your hands .
But what could I do ?
No , what would you have done ?
Pretend you 're me and I 'm you . No , no .
No , no . You 're Cleopatra and I 'm Antony .
Do I look like that ?
Well , do I ?
I think you 'd better stay as Cleopatra . Oh , no , no .
Don 't drink that .
No , that was part of the plan , too .
I was going to get you so irresponsible .
You didn 't think one goblet would do it , did you ?
Yes , wouldn 't it ?
Well , that does amuse me .
But it 's such a large goblet .
Yes , isn 't it ?
Well .
Well .
I hope that you know that I know you want me to do this .
Dear Antony , I hope you think I know that you know I know .
No , we 're not dining here after all .
No , wait .
What is it ?
Reed birds from the Nile .
Are they any good ?
Oh , they 're supposed to be .
There 's not very much to it , is there ?
Then we may dine here ?
I 'm really very hungry .
So am I , when it comes to that .
Your little reed birds aren 't enough for me . No , wait , Antony .
Clams from the sea . They 're catching them now .
Come and see .
Jewels .
You are a good fisherman .
The golden streams of Egypt never run dry .
Throw them .
Roman dogs .
Yes , Egyptian cats .
A song to the stars .
They must think we 're funny people ... scheming to destroy each other as if we had forever to live .
They must wonder :
" Why don 't Egypt and Rome meet in the public square ... " to plan union instead of conquest ? "
Yes , it 's very funny .
I said things to Caesar I wish I hadn 't .
Oh ?
There 's beauty in the Egyptian Queen besides her face . Do you miss him ?
No , he didn 't love me .
Is that really the reason ?
No , not really . I admire men who don 't love women .
What do you mean by that ?
Oh , I don 't know .
Women should be but toys for the great .
It becomes them both .
To you for that .
And to you for that .
Why , Antony .
What ?
Did I hear you hiccup ?
Not me .
I never hiccup .
Well , it certainly wasn 't me . Queens don 't hiccup .
Well , I don 't know whether they do or not .
They most certainly do not .
Queens only talk of stars . Well , who do you suppose it can be ?
Because I 'm sure I heard something .
It 's somebody under the couch . Ah .
Come out .
Come out !
They 're gaining .
I 'm very much afraid it 's the Queen of Egypt who 's hiccupping .
Oh , but doesn 't that seem a little absurd ? Yes .
I 'll stop them for you .
Don 't you ever have hiccups , Antony ?
No , not tonight , I don 't .
Does it hurt ?
Oh , no , not a bit .
Well , it did it , didn 't it ?
Oh , yes , it did it .
What would happen if you hit me like this ?
I 'd knock your head off .
And it would go rolling down the deck into the river .
Wouldn 't even touch the deck .
You 're charming .
All right , I 'm ready to go now .
Why ?
Oh , you don 't find me charming .
Yes , I do .
I could fall in love with you , but I don 't intend to .
What for ?
Do you mean that ?
There 's no one like you .
Octavian !
Octavian !
Hail !
Hail , Octavian !
Hail !
Hail , Octavian !
Your cheers at last !
And they can only mean that at last you agree with me ... that Marc Antony is a traitor to Rome . Antony 's a traitor !
A traitor , I tell you ! Two months , two long months have come and gone , and what has happened ?
Nothing ! Not a thing !
Has he attacked Egypt with his legions there ?
No !
No !
Has he brought Cleopatra back in chains ?
No !
No !
Has he done anything ?
No .
Nothing .
Yes , he 's done one thing , and that completely .
He 's sailed to Egypt with the Queen ... and lived there ever since with no thought of Rome .
He 's forgotten Rome .
Who is this poisonous snake that wrecks our men ?
Caesar first , and now Antony .
When will it end ?
I 'll tell you when !
Now !
Now !
This time it 's my turn .
There will be no more talk of war .
There will be war !
War ! No more shining words , but shining steel !
Rome will be paid with Antony 's blood ... and the Egyptian snake will be destroyed , and there shall be war !
War !
War !
War !
What ?
I never can believe it .
What ?
I should want to leave you right now .
Why should you ?
For a little while , I should .
Why ?
So that you won 't tire of me .
Aren 't you afraid I might tire of you ?
No .
I should want to go out and get drunk with a lot of men .
Or find another woman .
Well , why don 't you ?
Because you are another woman .
New .
Always new .
Completely new .
Majesty !
Majesty !
Majesty !
What is it ? King Herod has arrived .
Had you forgotten ?
No , no .
Where is he ?
He 's waiting in the audience chamber .
I beg of you . Hurry , Majesty .
Come now , what 's the hurry ?
Oh , please .
What do you care for the king of Judea ?
But he 's my guest .
Oh , now , be a good boy and stop frowning .
I have to dress .
All right , but kiss me first .
Now run along .
Welcome .
I hope to renew an old friendship . I hope so , too .
Well , time has made you older and wiser .
And me younger and more beautiful .
And any news ?
News , indeed .
I come directly from Rome on my way to Judea .
Ah . Yes , directly from Rome .
As a friend and ally of Rome ?
And as a friend and ally of Egypt .
And the news ?
If you 'll dismiss your court , I ...
Charmion .
Well ?
For the moment , I 'm tongue-tied before so much beauty .
The news .
The news .
You go to great length for the sake of Egypt , don 't you ?
You know , I ... I wonder how far you would go , really .
Octavian doesn 't like Antony ... but Octavian is in power now .
If Antony were dead ...
Octavian would be a very good friend and ally of Egypt .
He told me to give you that message .
I thought you were a friend of Antony .
I am .
I am .
I always said there was no man in the world that could drink with Antony ... but not now .
But listen ...
No , no , no .
My friend , when a man is drunk with love ... he can 't divide his concentration with wine , you know .
All major emotions are greedy .
And tell me , my friend , aren 't you happier with her than with a grape ?
Or anything else .
I 'm mad about her .
Of course you are , my boy .
Of course . That reminds me of something .
Something very funny , too , that I heard recently in Rome from Octavian .
Octavian ?
It must have been funny .
It was , Antony .
It was .
Listen , this is what he said .
If Cleopatra would poison Antony ...
Rome would forgive her for everything , and that would be the salvation for Egypt .
Poison me ?
Uh-huh . Poison you .
Just imagine , Cleopatra poisoning you .
What did I say ?
Isn 't it funny ?
It 's the funniest thing I 've ever heard .
As if love didn 't conquer all . As if it didn 't .
Poison me ?
I can 't wait to tell her !
How she 'll laugh .
I 'll go and tell her .
I 'll be right back .
Yes , do that , Antony .
Do tell her , please .
She ...
You poison me !
You must for Egypt .
Egypt .
Now you ask me to do murder for Egypt .
I can 't .
I can 't .
It 's only one life against the freedom of your people .
You don 't love him .
What 's your crime ?
Murder .
I killed my wife and child while I was drunk .
What punishment has been decreed ?
Crucifixion .
How long will it take you to die on the cross ?
I am strong , Majesty .
Two days .
Maybe three .
Would you like to die in three seconds ?
Majesty , you 're merciful .
Take this .
Drink it .
Was there any pain ?
A little , a very little .
There must be no pain .
What 's this ?
The Queen is testing poisons .
A wine we 've never had before , dear Antony .
I 've been saving it .
What for ?
For a night when the mood strikes .
I see .
And tonight is that night ?
Tonight .
Now , can you think of a pretty toast ?
It would please me very much .
You 're very gay .
And you 're very solemn .
Is there any reason ?
I 'm thinking .
Evidently .
Well , let 's drink first .
Perhaps pretty words will follow .
But you don 't drink .
Neither do you .
I don 't wish to drink alone .
And I don 't think I wish to drink at all .
Well ... he is in a strange mood tonight .
Now tell me , what 's the matter ?
Oh . For some reason , I 've ...
I 've no thirst tonight .
I 'd far prefer just to sit and watch you drink .
You really mean that ?
Yes , I do .
If that 's what you prefer , I always try to please you , Antony .
Oh , my dear .
The strangest man on the face of the earth .
The happiest man on the face of the earth .
Come on . Let 's drink .
Look , Antony .
What ? The reed birds again .
Not much of a meal for a man .
These things get smaller and smaller .
Do you remember the stars ?
Yes , and the river .
And the rose .
When I put it in your hair , and you were Cleopatra .
Yes , and I threw it back at you .
And I sweetened your wine with it .
That was a night .
Let 's drink to the river .
To the river .
Majesty .
What is it ?
A carrier pigeon from Rome .
Rome has declared war .
War ?
Let me see that .
Octavian declares me a traitor , eh ?
Octavian !
Octavian to meet me !
I 'm laughing now .
Go get Enobarbus .
Send him here .
I take orders only from my Queen . What ?
Now , get up and get him !
You keep out of this !
Another word from you , and I 'll smash you to powder .
Now , get him !
All Egyptians , eh ?
I need Roman soldiers now .
You , get my 10 generals and send them to me at once .
Yes , my lord . Well , jump to it !
Maps .
My maps .
Yes , lord . You , get my war chests .
Yes , lord .
Send carrier pigeons to Ventilius at Tarsus , Drusus at Athens ... and to my legions in Philippi ... to get under way at once and meet me and my 10 legions at Actium .
Yes , lord . Slaves , bring tables !
Yes , and get chairs , chairs for my generals !
I need Roman soldiers now .
So I 'm a traitor , am I ?
They 'll take that back on their knees !
And as for you and your Egypt , take your choice :
Rome or Antony ? It 's all the same to Antony .
Here , you !
All right , set it down .
I want galleys tomorrow morning to transport 10 legions .
Ten legions to Actium .
Tomorrow morning ?
Manned and equipped for six months ' siege .
The legions will assemble under my generals in the square .
Tomorrow morning ?
At dawn . Now , get out .
What answer will you send Octavian ?
Octavian ?
Send that to Octavian !
I 'm at war again !
No ! Antony !
Antony ! What 's the matter ?
What is it ?
At last , I 've seen a god come to life .
I 'm no longer a queen .
I 'm a woman .
You choose me , Cleopatra , against the world ?
Against the world .
Then we 'll meet it .
We 'll smash it to pieces , put it together again , and call it ours !
War !
Ah , Enobarbus !
Come over here .
I 've my plans all ready .
A trap that Octavian will fall into like a little mouse .
There 'll be no war .
Why , what 's happened ?
Disaster . Disaster ?
Yes , and for Octavian , complete disaster .
Where are my generals ?
They 're all here , Antony .
And can you blame them ?
They 're Romans .
They won 't serve under an Egyptian queen .
They won 't fight for Egypt against Rome .
They have gone .
They 've taken their legions with them .
Now they 're Octavian 's generals , and you are alone .
There 'll be no war .
There will be war !
And what will you fight with ?
The Egyptian army against all of Rome ?
If that 's all we have left , we fight with them .
We ?
What ?
I 'm not here to fight with the Egyptian army .
I 'm here to tell you that Rome is still yours if you want her .
Rome will always love you , Antony .
All that Rome wants is your love in return .
And there 's one way to prove that love .
One way , and overnight Octavian will be forgotten ... and Rome will take back to her arms her hero .
One way .
Well ?
Say the word , and I 'll plunge that through a woman 's heart .
And the report will be that you did it , and Rome will take you back to her heart .
There 's no room in Rome for Octavian and me .
You mean , there 's not room enough in your world ... for anything else but Cleopatra .
Yes .
Yes , that 's what I mean .
That 's what you mean .
And you 're the man I once heard say to Caesar :
" They can 't think .
They can 't fight .
They are playthings for us . "
No man can speak to me like that .
Get out ! I 'm getting out , but I 'm taking nothing of yours with me .
There 's Brittany back .
And there 's the campaign in Syria .
This , you 've long forgotten .
When I saved your life .
And this ... when you saved mine . And this ...
Put them back !
No !
Our long campaign together lies with the plans on the floor .
The war goes on .
Is that all you have to say ?
That 's all .
Well .
Goodbye , Antony .
You , who might have been the world 's great man ... ends all for a woman .
For that , I give you the world 's contempt .
But for what you might have been ...
I give you my last salute .
So Rome would forgive and take you back ?
And all they demand is for us to part .
Why don 't they ask the sun to fall right out of the sky ?
Yes , we 'll fight them .
We 'll fight them all if we have to fight alone .
Forward march !
Watch the cavalry !
Burn the boats ! On fire !
So you 've got it all , eh ?
All my generals , all my legions , all the Egyptians .
Everything I had on land and sea , you 've lured and brought away .
You 've got it all .
You 've got it all except me !
Come down and surrender .
You come up and get me !
Words .
He fights to the last with words .
Words . All right , you listen to them .
I 'll come down and fight you alone !
I can think of easier ways for you to die .
Well , if you 're afraid , I 'll fight the lot of you .
One by one .
Two by two .
And if that bores me , I 'll fight you three by three !
You 've forgotten how to fight ! You 've lost your army !
And if I decide to grant your request and choose to be the first you meet ... what 's the prize ?
The Egyptian Queen ?
Wait !
Shut up ! The Egyptian Queen is no man 's prize .
She is a warrior of her own and fights by my side .
Closer to the wall .
Closer to the wall .
It 's coming down . Don 't lower that bridge , you fools !
Put it up !
Closer to the bridge .
He mustn 't see us .
Put it up again , I say !
Majesty , did you see him on the wall ?
He looked so ...
Oh , can 't I tell him ?
He wouldn 't believe I could help him ... but it 's our last chance .
I 've got to take it . Forward .
Look , somebody 's coming out .
Can you see who it is ?
The olive branch ! They 're carrying the olive branch .
The Queen of Egypt !
Look .
Cleopatra .
It is the Queen !
Cleopatra surrenders !
Cleopatra .
Come back .
Come back .
Come back !
Come back !
He couldn 't even keep her !
She 's a warrior , all right , but she fights by our side !
Jump , Antony !
Jump !
All you 've got left now is the wall !
He can 't keep his woman .
Where you going ?
What 's your hurry ?
Wine .
Bring me wine .
Look , this is Antony the Roman leader .
This is Antony at the square in Tarsus .
To send the woman back in chains , then on to Egypt with marching men !
Here 's to Antony !
My lord , can I ...
Get out .
But Tarsus isn 't here it seems .
Instead , a couch .
A couch to lie on .
A woman to give your arms to instead of chains .
Antony , who can 't think or fight .
Antony , the plaything of a woman !
And there is Egypt .
Yours .
All I ask is to save his life .
Spare him , and I promise you 'll never see him again .
I shall take him away , far up the Nile ... and leave with you Egypt .
I suppose of all the requests that have ever been made ... yours is the most hopeless .
Spare Antony 's life ?
I 'd sooner be dead myself .
And as for you , this time you do go back to Rome in chains .
This time you face a man !
Take her away .
We can 't do that , Excellence .
She came bearing the olive branch .
What 's the difference ?
We 've only to smash the city 's gates .
Oh , we 'll smash the city 's gates , all right .
But she must have safe conduct back .
We are Romans .
Oh , all right .
Go back and kiss him goodbye .
Thank you , soldier .
When you smash the gates ... you had better come in behind your men .
I failed , but there 's still a way out for us .
I have horses waiting beyond the passage to the tombs ... and a boat with trusted rowers will take us to the upper Nile .
Antony , we can lose ourselves there and still be happy .
Antony , listen .
I never wanted to see you again .
How deep does a man have to stab to die ?
Antony !
Antony , what ...
No , no more Antony !
Antony 's gone .
You go back to Octavian .
He 's the Caesar now .
You thought I went to him ?
You ... You thought that of me ?
Am I blind ?
I went for your sake .
I went to plead for your life .
To plead , Antony .
I was pleading for your life , and you were taking it .
Antony .
I am blind indeed .
I am dying , Egypt .
Dying .
Listen . There 's little time .
Away from war in upper Egypt with you would have been very sweet ... but this , this is a better end .
A Roman by a Roman conquered .
No , no , no .
Don 't pity me . Don 't pity me .
We were born for war .
It was the soul of our love , and we part at the top of our glory .
My precious Cleopatra , I 'm happy .
The end is in your arms .
My love .
Take me away with you into the shadows ... as close as if you could carry me in your arms .
I am taking you with me , Egypt .
I am taking you with me .
Forever .
Antony .
Hurry , Majesty .
Hurry !
They 're at the doors .
Prepare me .
The Queen of Egypt goes to meet the conqueror .
The doors are breaking .
Royal Egypt , let me die before I see you go to Rome in chains , defeated .
I 'm not going to Rome , Charmion .
Now , give me the basket .
It holds victory .
It works .
Little Iras .
Charmion .
Look well for love .
Look well .
And not finding it , give nothing .
But if blessed with Cleopatra 's fortune ... give all .
Now , go .
- Want my quack-quack .
- No , darling , not now .
Wait till Mother finishes your bath .
Won 't be but just a minute now .
Want my quack-quack . There .
Upsy-daisy .
There .
Want my quack-quack .
No , darling , not now .
Later . Please be good .
Mommy 's so late and she 's got so much to do .
What 's Mommy got to do ?
Well , she has to get you dressed , get you breakfast , take you down to the day nursery .
Don 't wanna go to the day nursery .
Want to stay home with Mommy .
Ah , darling , I wish you could , but you can 't .
Why ?
Because Mother has to go out and sell lots of cans of maple syrup ... so she can buy nice things for her baby .
Don 't want to go to the day nursery .
Marjorie pulled my hair .
She did ?
Well , she was a very bad girl to do that .
I pulled her back harder .
Well , I suppose if she pulled you first , it was all right .
I pulled her first .
You did ?
Then you 're a naughty girl .
And you won 't go to heaven .
Don 't want to go to heaven .
Want my quack-quack .
♪ I love you and you love me ♪
♪ And I don 't wanna go to the day nursery ♪
Oh , I think we 're gonna have an opera singer in the family .
Don 't you ?
♪ I love you and you love me ♪
♪ And I don 't wanna go to the day nursery ♪
Mommy , telephone !
I hear it , darling .
Now you sit here and be good for just a minute .
Hello .
Good morning , Mr. Auburn .
Yes .
Yes ... Yes .
Excuse me just a minute , please , will you ?
Hello ?
Yes , Mr. Auburn .
I was terribly sorry not to find you in .
Since my husband 's death , I 've been carrying on his business . Mommy !
Yes , dear , yes .
What , Mr. Auburn ?
Mommy , can I come down ?
Yes . No , no , dear .
Wait till I finish dressing you .
That was just the baby .
Yes , I have a little girl . Thank you .
I 'll have the syrup delivered to you within an hour .
Thank you so much .
Good-bye .
Yes ?
Good morning .
I come in answer to your advertisement for a girl .
What ?
The advertisement what say , " Wanted :
Cook , laundress , housemaid , colored , not afraid of hard work , moderate wages . "
There must be some mistake .
I haven 't advertised for any girl .
Ain 't this Astor Avenue ?
No , this is Astor Street .
Astor Avenue is way the other side of town .
Oh .
Funny I didn 't notice that little " avenue " word .
That 's just my luck .
- What they got two streets alike for , anyhow ?
- I don 't know .
I don 't know what I better do .
There 's a streetcar at the corner .
Take that , and you 'll be there in about 10 minutes .
- We has to walk . - Oh . - No , you wait here .
I 'll get you carfare .
- Thank you .
Something 's burnin ' .
Wha ... Oh , dear .
Nice quack-quack .
Oh !
Jessie !
Oh , darling .
Are you hurt ?
I fell down .
Oh , darling .
Oh , darling , look at you .
I 's all wet .
Oh .
I 'll say you 're all wet .
We 're gonna eat such a big breakfast , aren 't we ?
Oh , how nice of you !
I see 'd you was in a " fummix , " so I thought I 'd lend a hand .
Horsie .
Why , darling , what do you mean by saying such a thing ?
Horsie .
Nice horsie .
I 've been took for many things , but I ain 't never been took for that before .
Thank you for all you 've done .
Here 's your carfare .
I wish you good luck .
Thank you kindly .
Come on , darling . Come on .
Run along .
You sure you wouldn 't need somebody for your own self ?
I 'm handy with housework .
And taking care of children that just comes natural to me .
I 'm afraid I couldn 't afford it .
I wish I could .
Don 't worry about wages , if that 's what 's on your mind .
If I could get a home for my little girl , I 'd be glad to work for just room and board .
You 've got a child ?
Yes 'm .
That 's the drawback about a job . Folks just don 't want Peola .
You sweet little child .
Come here , Peola . Come on .
Say good mornin' to the lady , Peola .
- Good morning .
- Good morning , dear .
Why , she 's a lovely little girl .
Yes 'm .
She 's very light .
Her pappy was a very light colored man .
Peola 's a nice brung up child . She ain 't been dragged up like most of 'em is .
Oh , your sweet child .
What might her name be ?
It 's Jessie .
As I was saying , ma 'am , if you could put up with my little girl ... and give her and me a roof over our heads , I 'd be willing to work for almost nothin ' .
Well , I have got a room you could use , but ...
Don 't worry about food .
Peola , she don 't eat nothin ' .
She 's so little .
And I 's deceivin' as to proportion .
I don 't eat like I look . It 's the truth .
I 's very light at the table .
Just 200 pounds of mother fighting to keep her baby .
Two hundred and forty , yes 'm .
I could get jobs all right , 'ceptin ' for Peola .
But I can 't be separated from Peola , no matter what happens .
You know how it is , ma 'am .
Indeed I do know .
Does we get to stay , ma 'am ?
Please .
All right , we 'll try it .
All right .
Sit down and I 'll have your breakfast ready in a jiffy .
Good evenin ' , Miss Bea .
You 're pretty late tonight .
Yes , I know .
Where 's my baby ?
She 's gone to bed .
Oh , I thought I 'd get home in time to see her before she went to sleep .
She played so hard all day , she almost went to sleep while eating supper .
I 'll run up anyway .
Maybe she 's still awake .
Seems like I never get to see her at all anymore .
Yes 'm .
Your supper 's ready , Miss Bea .
Oh , my feet hurt .
Come and sit down and let me rub your feet .
Come on .
All right .
Oh .
That rests me all over .
It don 't seem right for you to be carrying around them heavy cans of syrup , peddling ' .
I 've gotta make a living .
With your pretty face and them pretty foots . You oughta have a man takin ' care of you , honey .
Oh , Delilah .
Yes 'm .
I had a man once , but he up and died on me .
Is that gentleman in the picture your late husband , ma 'am ?
Mm-hmm , that was he .
Was you very much in love with your late husband , might I inquire ?
Well , I married him .
Hmph . But did you love him ? That 's what I asked , honey .
Oh , Delilah ,
I think I was too young to know very much about love .
Mother was dead .
He was my father 's choice .
Father wanted somebody to take care of me , so I married him .
Mmm , that 's a pity .
It 's too bad when you get started off on the wrong foot first .
Oh , but you 'll get over it .
Youse got a big surprise comin ' to you , Miss Bea .
You need some lovin ' , honey child .
What I need is a little supper .
Yes 'm . I got some nice food ready for you tonight .
That 's fine .
Thank you .
I 've got Jessie .
That 's enough .
Delilah , honestly now , doesn 't she look like an angel ?
Why she am an angel , Miss Bea .
Can we have some pancakes too ?
Please , Mammy .
They look awful tasty .
Go on out of here .
You two have had your breakfast .
Go play , and take that fleabag with you .
Okay , Aunt Delilah .
You 'll be the death of me with these pancakes .
I 'm glad you finds ' em to your taste , ma 'am .
I 've never tasted anything so good in my life .
How do you make them ?
It 's a secret .
Them pancakes is my grannie 's secret .
She passed it down to my mammy , and my mammy told me .
But I ain 't telling ' nobody .
No , sir .
I don 't blame you .
I wouldn 't either .
Down South , my mammy was famous for her pancakes .
White folks come from miles around just to taste ' em . Yes 'm .
It 's a secret , and it 's gonna die with Delilah .
All you do is just take a little ...
That 's all ?
That 's all .
There 's your secret .
Course you 've got to be light with the flap .
Mmm , look at the time .
You 've made me late with your pancakes .
Good-bye .
Good-bye , honey . And good luck for the day .
Thank you , Delilah .
Miss Bea ?
Wait a minute .
What is it ?
What 's the matter ?
I want you to take this rabbit 's foot and put it in your money purse .
Now , Delilah !
Yes 'm , you must take it .
Are you the owner ?
Yes 'm .
I 'm Mrs. Pullman .
Mrs. B. Pullman .
You know .
Sorry , but I don 't .
My husband was B. Pullman , the man who was killed in the wreck .
The train wreck at Camden .
I remember the wreck , but there were so many killed .
He used to sell waffle syrup to the hotels and places .
It 's wonderful syrup .
A hundred percent pure maple .
I don 't eat it .
Bad stomach . Gas .
No , I don 't mean ...
I 'm keeping up the B. Pullman business .
I was wondering . Could I make a deal with you to rent this store ?
I have a marvelous formula for making pancakes , and it 's my intention ... to rent a store , have a pancake place and sell syrup on the side .
This morning I was going to decide on several sites .
This is one of them .
It 's a good concession .
One of the best on the boardwalk .
How much are you asking for rent ?
Two hundred and fifty .
That 's very high .
That 's terribly high .
You 've got to pay for a good location .
This store has nice living quarters in the back . Mm-hmm .
Yes .
What will you do in the way of decorating ?
A lot will have to be done .
It 's going to rent as is .
You don 't think I 'd take it in this condition ?
Look at it .
It 's filthy !
It needs new paint , new paper .
And the floor .
That 'll have to be fixed .
If it needs it , you 'll have to do it .
Will you give me three months free ?
What ?
Give me three months free , and I 'll do all the decorating and alterations .
What do you think I am ?
I might consider one month .
Make it two , and I 'll take a year 's lease .
It 's a deal .
I 'll have to have the first and last month in advance .
I can 't do that .
I can 't give you anything in advance .
When do you expect to pay ?
Well , you said you 'd give me two months .
So I 'll start paying the third month .
Nothing doing .
But I 'll need every dollar I have for alterations and fixtures .
Delilah .
Delilah !
We 're going into business .
We 're which ?
You 're going to make your pancakes , and I 'm going to sell them on the boardwalk .
I 've rented a concession .
We 're gonna live in rooms in the back . The store 's at the front .
Get buckets , rags and soap . We 've got to start cleaning up .
Gather the children .
They 'll have to go with us .
I talked to a painter and a man about the fixtures .
They 'll be there , so hurry up .
There . This is it , Delilah .
My , it 's a very nice store .
You and Peola go outside and play . There 's a lovely place for you in the back .
Go look at the nice yard you 've got to play in .
Won 't that be pretty when there 's flowers in there ?
Be careful . Don 't sit on the floor , ' cause it 's all dirty yet .
These will be the living quarters .
The most important thing now is the store .
Take that sign down and cover the front window with Bon Ami .
Miss Bea ?
Yes .
Is somebody died ?
What ?
Is you been left money ? Mercy , no !
Well you only had $ 19 and some change this morning .
Yes , I know . Shh .
Here 's the painter .
How do you do ?
Hello .
You certainly did come over right away .
Yes , ma 'am .
All this has to be painted , the ceiling calcimined , and that back room papered in the paper I selected . This is it .
I want you to give me an estimate , and please make it low .
But I must-a see it first . Oh , sure .
Go right ahead .
Do you paint signs ?
No , but I can have one made for you .
I 'll tell you what I want .
I want a great big sign with lots ...
Delilah ?
Ma 'am ?
- Smile .
- Huh ?
You know , smile .
No , no .
A great big one .
Oh , yes 'm .
That 's it !
Now turn to the right .
Hold it .
That 's what I want .
A big picture of Delilah looking like that .
And underneath , " Aunt Delilah 's Homemade Pancakes . "
You see what I mean ?
Yes , ma 'am .
But I must send someone to make that up for you . All right . Thanks .
That 's all right .
Delilah ! All right .
All right .
It 's all over . It 's all over .
I 'm gonna make you famous yet .
My Lordy , who 's that ?
The furniture man about the fixtures .
How do you do ?
Did you bring the estimate on the things I selected ?
Yes , Mrs. Pullman .
Good .
This is where the grill should be , I think .
And all across here I 'd like to have shelves .
If the shelves start there and go straight up the top , it should be nice , don 't you th ... The counter will be there .
Will you excuse me ?
Surely .
I 'll look around .
Yes . Thank you .
Did you get it all figured out ?
I tell you .
For a first-a class-a job , there is lots of work here .
For a first-a class-a A-one job , because I don 't work cheap , Yes .
The best-a figure I can give you is $ 193 .
A hundred and ninety-three dollars ?
That should be a good job .
Sure !
Five percent off for 30 days ?
Huh ?
No , no , no .
If I give you 30 days to pay , I can 't take-a nothing off .
All right , $ 193 in 30 days . Uh-huh .
That 's fine . And you 'll do a good job ?
Sure .
And start right away . Sure .
I take another man off another job .
And we start-a right away .
Thank you .
Good-bye .
Good-bye .
You 're gonna have a nice place here .
I hope so .
You 'd better make it eight tables instead of six .
Yes , ma 'am .
That 'll mean 32 chairs . Mm-hmm .
Yes .
The coffee urn , the grill , the counter stools and the dishes .
Here 's the list .
Installed , that will cost you $ 1,560 .
How much for cash ?
That is cash .
Oh , that ...
And the terms for monthly payments ?
Ten percent down on delivery and $ 50 a month .
You 're asking $ 156 down ?
I might as well pay cash !
Make it $ 50 straight monthly payments .
Only $ 50 down ?
Why , that 'll hardly pay the cost of my trucking .
That 's the best I can do .
I 'm opening a chain of these shops along the boardwalk .
I already have a large wholesale distribution of maple syrup .
That takes up a great deal of my ready cash .
Make it $ 50 straight monthly payments , and it 's a deal .
I don 't know now .
You see ...
How soon could you have the fixtures installed ?
With the exception of the grill , right away .
Of course , that will take time . But ...
I can 't do much without the grill , so you will hurry it up , won 't you ?
I 'll do the best I can , but ...
I 'll be down later this afternoon and sign the order .
But you see ...
What a lovely scarf pin .
Yes , it is .
I wish you could make it a little more down .
Don 't be so greedy .
Just look what a big order I 've given you .
Yes , I am .
Be sure and come in for some pancakes sometime .
Pancakes ?
Oh , pancakes .
Yes , pancakes . Good-bye .
Thank you .
Come again .
There you are , Mrs. Pullman .
Paid in full .
Think of that .
I 've really paid my last debt .
It 's more than a great many can say .
Yes , ma 'am .
You 've built up a mighty pretty business here , Mrs. Pullman .
Mighty pretty .
It does you good to see someone go ahead and make a success .
It hasn 't been so easy as all that .
You 'll never know how near you 've come to getting your fixtures back on your hands .
But all in all , I 've got by and I 've nothing to complain of .
You 've no idea how often I 've told the story , the way you opened up here .
You paid nothing down on the store because you agreed to put the improvements in .
And you got the improvements because you had the store .
And when I came to collect , you talked me out of that .
All I had was talk .
And yet , a pretty woman like you ...
Ah , we won 't go into that .
Come on , children . Time for school .
In a minute , Mommy .
Good day , Mrs. Pullman .
Let 's go .
Let 's do it over again .
All right .
England ?
France ? London .
Paris .
Italy ? Don 't tell me now .
Rome .
Now you ask me .
Germany ?
Berlin .
Denmark ?
Don 't tell me , now .
Copenhagen .
Belgium ?
Sprouts ?
You mean Brussels ! Yeah .
First thing you know , you 're gonna get a " D " again .
Good-bye , Mommy .
Good-bye , honey .
They sure likes each other , them two .
Peola 's smarter than Jessie .
Yes 'm .
We all starts out that way .
We don 't get dumb till later on .
Oh , Delilah .
It 's been nice for them to have each other all these years when we 've been so busy .
You think we all gonna make money , Miss Bea ?
I hope so , Delilah .
It 's hard to start out .
But we 've paid our debts , we 've got money in the bank .
We 're certainly better off than we were five years ago .
We sure is , honey .
It certainly would be nice if we got rich .
It certainly would .
I could send Jessie away to college .
And Peola , she wouldn 't have to do housework for nobody .
Once in a while , we could take a vacation .
All the vacation I need is to get off of my feet .
Maybe have a little place in the country .
There 's plenty gentlemen on the boardwalk would be glad to give you that and more ... if you weren 't so set in your ways .
I sees them smiling ' at you .
There 's Peola .
I wonder what 's the matter .
Peola ?
Peola !
What 's the matter , honey ?
What 's happened ?
Peola .
What 's happened to my baby ?
I 'm not black !
I 'm not black !
I won 't be black !
Peola ! She called me black .
Jessie called me that .
Now , now .
Jessie .
Jessie Pullman , for shame on you .
Come and sit on Mammy 's lap . That 's a girl .
Now , now , now , Peola .
Calm yourself , baby .
You gotta learn to take it .
You might just as well begin now .
You apologize to Peola this minute .
No , no , Miss Bea .
Don 't make her apologize .
Ain 't no good in that .
You !
It 's ' cause you 're black .
You make me black .
I won 't !
I won 't !
I won 't be black .
Jessie , how could you say such a mean , cruel thing to Peola ?
I didn 't mean anything .
It ' tain 't her fault , Miss Bea .
It ain 't yours and it ain 't mine .
I don 't know rightly where the blame lies .
It can 't be our Lord 's .
It 's got me puzzled .
Oh , dear !
I don 't want to get the Old Maid again .
Your turn now .
Let 's see .
Watch me pick a real good one .
Ah , shucks ! That was a good one .
Now , be careful .
How you feeling , darling ?
My headache 's much better .
Is it ?
Uh-huh . School 's nearly out .
It 's time to be better .
I really have got a cold .
I know you have , darling .
I was only fooling .
Anyway , I 'm glad to have an excuse to keep you home with me .
My , ain 't that rain raining ' terrible ?
Surely is .
Seem like the ocean 's turned bottom side upwards .
How you feel , honey ?
Better , thank you .
Oh , that 's good .
My Peola forgot her rubbers and umbrella .
I guess I better meet her with ' em else we 'll have two of 'em down instead of one .
We 'll read a chapter until the rain lets up .
Then I think you 'll be able to get home .
Shall it be Little Men or Little Women ?
Little Women !
All right . Little Women .
" Jo was very busy in the garret , " for the October days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short .
For two or three hours , the sun lay warmly in the high window . "
Good afternoon , ma 'am .
It 's rainin ' so hard , I brought rubbers and coat to fetch my little girl home .
You 've made some mistake .
Ain 't this the 3-B ?
Yes . Well , this is it .
It can 't be it .
I have no colored children in my class .
Oh , thank you .
There 's my little girl .
Peola .
Oh . My poor baby .
Teacher , has she been passin ' ?
Passin ' ?
Why , yes . Peola .
You may go home .
Gee , I didn 't know she was colored .
Neither did I.
I hate you .
I hate you !
I hate you !
Peola ! Peola , honey !
Peola .
Peola ! Peola , honey !
Some rain !
Yeah .
Hello .
Swell weather for ducks .
Not for business .
No . Hotcakes and coffee .
I see you have a window-shopper , Mrs. Pullman .
Yeah .
Some aroma .
Why don 't you come in and have some ?
If I had the price , I 'd been outside of six stacks Of ' em already .
Oh . Yes , ma 'am .
I 'm practically the greatest living pancake surrounder ... in the Western Hemisphere .
I took it up as a child .
Took years to perfect myself .
But I 'm not having any today .
I 'm sorry . Not half as sorry as I am .
Come and have some anyway , on the house .
You mean it ?
Sure , I do . I 'm practically in .
Why , Peola , didn 't you see your mother ?
Yes , I saw her . She had your raincoat and rubbers .
What happened ?
Nothing .
Come , Peola .
Let me take those wet clothes off of ya .
Now , baby , there ain 't no need of being thataway .
Go away and leave me alone !
What 's the matter ?
Don 't tell her . Don 't tell me what ?
She was passin ' , Miss Bea , and I give her away .
She know I wouldn 't have done it on purpose .
Now , Peola , you mustn 't feel that way .
Oh , she can 't help herself just now , Miss Bea .
She 's like her pappy was .
He beat his fists against life all his days .
It eat him through and through .
Go on , darling . Take your wet clothes off .
Perhaps you 'd better send her to a different school .
I can 't keep sending her to different schools all her life , Miss Bea .
Well , were they good ?
Good ? Listen , man and boy , I 've been eating griddle cakes for 35 years , but I never tasted any as good as these .
What do you put in ' em ?
That 's the secret .
That 's what I was afraid of .
Too bad too .
Why ? To keep anything as wonderful as this away from the world .
How 'd you like to trade in another stack of wheat cakes ... for a hundred-thousand dollar idea ?
Honest .
I mean it .
Mean what ? I can tell you in two words how to make a million dollars .
Just two ?
Just two .
Did you ever hear the story of Coca-Cola ?
No . When they first put it on the market , they used to peddle it over soda fountains for five cents a copy .
But it didn 't make any money .
One day a smart fella nudged the president and said ,
" For $ 100,000, I 'll tell you in two words how to make millions . "
You know what those two words were ?
Uh-uh . " Bottle it . "
" Bottle it " ?
Mm-hmm . Now , the pancakes ... the flour , I mean , box it .
Box it ?
Sure , box it .
Do I get that stack of wheat ?
The other fella got a hundred thousand smackers .
Yeah !
Yeah , you get all the pancakes you can eat , and a job besides .
Well , I don 't know about that .
I ain 't gonna do it , Miss Bea .
No , ma 'am , I ain 't gonna do it .
I don 't know why I bother about all this .
I 've gone without my dinner .
I barnstormed over here in the snow ... to tell her she 's on Easy Street . And I get just as far as a stranded dogfish on the Barnegat Shoals .
Now you tell her .
Now , look , Delilah .
We 've made $ 15,000 in the last six months .
We 'll double that byJuly , and make $ 100,000 next year .
So now we want to incorporate .
Yes 'm . That 's the best way to run a business .
Yes 'm . Now , here are the papers for you to sign .
But if I sign them , then what ?
Then you 'll have a 20 % interest in the Aunt Delilah Corporation .
You 'll be rich .
You 'll have your own car , your own house .
My own house ?
You gonna send me away , Miss Bea ?
I can 't live with ya ?
Honey child , please don 't send me away .
Don 't do that to me .
Why , don 't you want your own house ?
No . How am I gonna take care of you and Miss Jessie if I ain 't here ?
Oh , Delilah .
You 'll have me in tears in a minute .
Let me and Peola stay the same as we been doin ' .
I 's your cook , and I wanna stay your cook .
Of course you can stay , Delilah .
I only thought now that the money 's coming in ... and after all , it 's all from your pancake flour .
I gives it to ya , honey .
I makes you a present of it .
Youse welcome .
Oh , Delilah , you 're hopeless .
I could 've told you that .
Well , I 'll simply have to put the money in the bank for you .
That 's all right , if you want to , against my funeral .
I does hanker for a good funeral .
Once a pancake , always a pancake .
What are you doing behind the bar ?
I 'm hiding . Hiding ?
What do you mean ?
It 's all your fault .
Look at me .
What 's the matter ?
You look grand . Yeah , I look like a crow calling to its firstborn .
Did you hear what I was saying ?
No . I 've been trying to say that you 're one of the grandest party givers in New York .
Have another cocktail .
Good . I will . I want to drink a toast .
Gentlemen , I give you the fifth anniversary ...
No , no , the 10th . The 10th anniversary of Aunt Delilah 's Pancake Flour .
Thank you .
Them boys sure play good for white boys .
They oughta play well . They get paid enough for it .
What 's that got to do with it , Peola ?
Oh , nothing .
A charming party , Bea .
Thank you , darling .
Hello , Hugo . Hello , my dear .
Sorry I 'm late .
It 's nice to see you anytime .
You 're beautiful tonight , and so young .
Thank you .
Bless you for that .
Is Jessie still at school ?
I suppose she 'll come home a young lady .
I 'm afraid so .
Come on , honey , I 'll dance with ya .
Can 't you leave me alone ?
I don 't want to dance .
I want to read .
How long is this party gonna keep up anyway ?
What 's the matter with my baby ?
I 'm sick and tired of it .
What , the party ?
No ... not the party .
What is it , baby ?
What 's my baby want ?
I wanna be white like I look .
Peola .
Look at me . Am I not white ?
Isn 't that a white girl ?
Honey , we 's had this out so many times .
Can 't you get it out of your head ?
You wouldn 't understand that , would you ?
Oh , what is there for me anyway ?
Peola .
Are you looking for something ?
Yes .
The doorbell .
The doorbell ?
Yes , isn 't it silly ?
I can 't find the doorbell .
I 've heard of people lighting matches to find house numbers , but never a doorbell .
Do you know , by any chance , where it 's hidden ?
Why , yes .
It 's over there .
It 's all right , thanks .
Jarvis ?
Yes , madam . Who 's the gentleman who just came in ?
I don 't know , madam .
I thought perhaps ... The light isn 't working .
Will you have it fixed ?
Very good , madam .
Oh !
Hello .
Hello !
Well , I finally got in . Yes , so I see .
By the way , have you ever seen that doorbell ?
Why , yes ... I supposed it 's studded with diamonds , and they put it in the safe after dark .
I 'm coming up here by daylight and take a good look at it .
Yes , do .
Shall we dance ?
Mm-hmm .
I 'd love to . Excuse me .
I was late getting here .
The party 's nearly over .
Not for me . And to think I had this forced on me .
You didn 't want to come ?
No . A friend asked me .
Elmer Smith .
Oh , Elmer asked you !
Yes .
Do you know him ? Yes .
He 's been trying to drag me up to see her ever since I got in town .
See whom ?
Mrs. Pullman , the pancake queen .
Oh !
I put it off as long as I could .
Mm-hmm . You know , these big businesswomen frighten me to death .
Why ?
They 're so efficient and competent , and ...
Tell me , what 's she really like ?
Oh , she 's , um ... Let 's see .
Why don 't you ask your friend Elmer ?
No , he says she 's beautiful .
Wonderful . A noble character .
But what else could he say ?
You don 't think he 'd jeopardize a $ 50,000 a year job .
Not Elmer .
May I get you something ?
An ice or some " flannel " cakes ?
Flannel cakes ?
Yes , or whatever she calls them .
You don 't think a pancake queen is going to pass an opportunity to advertise her product ?
I 'd like some champagne .
May I have two ...
Just one moment , sir . Please .
There must be more than this !
But there are still six cases left , sir .
It 's going awfully fast .
Here , keep these two for me .
I may need them later .
Yes , sir . So that 's where you are !
You 're late .
You 're drunk .
You 're a liar .
May I have two ?
At once , sir . Nice time to be showing up .
I 've been here for hours .
No wonder I couldn 't find you hiding behind this bar .
Nice way to treat a guest .
A stranger too . I 've been watching for you all night .
Didn 't think you 'd wait till the party was over .
Why do they build dog kennels in bars ?
Come on .
I want you to meet Mrs. Pullman .
Can 't now .
Some other time . What do you mean , " some other time " ?
I 've something more important to do right now .
For instance ? I 'm taking a drink to a very charming lady .
You haven 't lost any time , have you ?
I tried not to . Don 't you think it 's time you paid your respects to your hostess ?
Later .
Here she is , and you 're going to meet her , whether you want to or not .
Bea , this is an old friend of mine , Stephen Archer .
Steve , this is Mrs. Pullman .
The pancake queen .
Oh .
I don 't know what to say .
How to ... I 've been so rude .
I 'm so sorry .
Sorry ! What are you sorry about now ?
I hope you 'll never know .
Say , what 's the matter with him anyway ?
Don 't feel too badly .
I led you on to your downfall .
I feel all kinds of a fool .
You see , I was to have met Elmer here .
And then I ... I met you instead .
It 's all right now , isn 't it ?
If you say so , yes .
You know , I 'm not really civilized .
For the past eight months I 've been walking on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean ... with jellyfish and whales .
What are you talking about ?
Let me introduce myself again .
My name is Stephen Archer , and I am an ichthyologist .
A what ? Ichthyologist .
Fishes .
I study fishes for those who are interested in the life of the fish .
So you can better understand why a man who spends all of his time with fish ... should behave like one .
Good night .
Good night .
Good night .
Have one ?
No , thanks .
Good night .
Well , it 's getting late . The guests are going home .
I said the guests were going home .
Yes , I know .
It 's after 2 : 00 .
Way after .
I 'm aware of the time . Also other things .
It 's no use you hanging around here .
Tomorrow you 'll just be the forgotten man , that 's all .
Then I 'd better make the most of tonight .
She 's got no time for silly romance .
She 's such a charming woman .
Uh-huh .
And you 're such a fortunate man .
Why ? To be her general manager .
You don 't , by any chance , need an office boy down there , do you ?
Yes . We 've got one .
I 'm it .
Good night .
Good night , dear .
I 'll see you Thursday .
I 'll be there .
Good night .
Leaving , Elmer ?
Or can I get you something ?
You can get my hat and coat .
I 'm going home .
Jarvis , Mr. Smith 's hat and coat .
Where did you meet that nice friend of yours ?
I don 't remember . I think it was in a speakeasy .
He 's a fugitive from justice .
I don 't know how such people get into your house .
Put the piano in the safe .
But he 's a friend of yours , isn 't he ?
That 's my story , and I 'm going to stick to it .
That 's all , Jarvis .
The old bear loves you , doesn 't he ?
He 's been such a faithful watchdog to Jessie and me .
Jessie ?
My daughter .
Here she is .
She 's older than that now .
She 's away at school .
She 's charming .
Like you .
She doesn 't seem so wonderful to others , but to me , she 's the beginning and the end of everything .
I don 't wonder .
Not finished ?
Are you throwing me out ?
I 'm a working woman .
There 's tomorrow morning , you know .
This must be yours .
It 's the only one left .
This is brutal .
I 'll go on two conditions .
What ? That you lunch with me tomorrow .
I mean today at ...
I never go out for lunch .
At Pierre 's at 1 : 15 .
All right .
But I said two conditions .
What 's the other ?
Will you kiss me ?
What ?
So I 'll know I 'm forgiven .
You did lead me on , you know .
It was fun . Just a little bit cruel , aren 't you ?
I 'm a woman .
You 're Juliet and Beatrice and Diana of the Crossways .
All the women I 've loved .
Have you only loved characters in books ?
Mostly . Waiting for one to come alive .
And now one has .
Thank you .
Pierre 's at 1 : 15 .
Good night .
Good night .
By the way , next time ... the bell is here .
I 'll remember next time .
Hello , Delilah .
Come on up .
Let 's talk the party over .
It 's the best part of it anyway .
Everybody gone ?
Mm-hmm .
I 'm not a bit sleepy .
Don 't bother about that now .
Let it go till morning .
Miss Bea , you sure had a good party .
I think so . It feels good to get those off .
I 'll bet it does .
Come here . Let me take ' em .
Put ' em up here . That 's it .
That 's what you used to do in the old boardwalk days .
When my feet ached from peddling maple syrup .
Remember ? I remembers .
We 's gone a long ways from there , ain 't we , though ?
We certainly have .
Miss Bea , there was a very handsome gentleman up here tonight .
I got a peek at him .
Who might he be ?
I wonder which one .
Don 't you know a handsome gentleman when you sees one , honey ?
There was a handsome gentleman .
I wonder if I mean the same one you mean .
You does , honey .
What 's the gentleman 's name ?
Stephen Archer .
Hmm . That 's a good name for a good man .
Funny thing , Miss Bea . I got a great sense about a man .
You ain 't takin' no chance there .
Mercy , Delilah ! Of course I 'm not taking a chance !
To hear you talk , you 'd think he 'd proposed and been accepted .
That 's all right . Leave him be . Things is workin ' .
Leave him be .
I 'll leave him be .
You gotta do your part , honey .
What on earth do you mean ?
If he makes a move in the right direction , you don 't have to slap his hand , in a manner of speaking ' .
There 's nothing farther from my mind than a husband .
What he do , Miss Bea ?
He 's an ichthyologist .
Yes 'm .
I always say , there ain 't a better business for a man to be in .
He make pretty good money at it , I guess .
At what , Delilah ?
At that " ichylologist " business .
Yes , I think he does very well at it .
Well , I declare . Keep him indoors , I suppose .
No , outdoors most of the time .
A traveling ' man , I reckon .
All over the world . All over the world .
Say , honey , what is this business of his ?
It 's fishing , Delilah .
Just fishin ' ?
Uh-huh .
With a hook ?
No . The study of fishes .
Oh .
But I wouldn 't let that stand in my way .
Let him go fishin ' .
There 's worse things .
Funny , though . He don 't look to be a lazy man .
Oh , Delilah .
You 're incurably romantic .
It ' tain 't romantic to want a man .
I 've gotJessie .
And you 've got Peola .
Yes 'm . I got Peola , Miss Bea .
What am I gonna do about that poor child ?
Delilah , I 've been wondering if it might not be better if you could send Peola ... to one of those good colleges in the South for colored people , where she could finish her education and she wouldn 't be faced ... with the problem of white all the time .
You know what a disaster her schooling has been here .
If she 'd only go .
Ask her anyway .
We 've worked so long and so hard for our two girls .
And for Jessie , it 's been well worthwhile .
I want you to have the same satisfaction with Peola .
You deserve it , Delilah .
I 'll do everything in my power to help you .
Maybe down there in some other school ...
Why don 't you talk to her ?
Yes 'm . I 'll go right down , and if she ain 't asleep ,
I 'll try and reason with her . Yes , try , Delilah .
Yes 'm .
Good night , Miss Bea . Good night , dear .
Asleep yet , honey ?
No .
Peola , won 't you be a good child like you can be , darling , and do something for your mammy ?
Don 't say " mammy " !
Look here , baby , you go down South ... to one of them high-toned colleges where only the high-toned goes .
Wouldn 't you do that for me , honey ?
A Negro school ?
Ain 't nothing to be ashamed of , daughter dear .
Meet your cross halfway .
It won 't be near so heavy .
Go amongst your own .
Quit battling ' !
Your little head 's sore now from buttin' against stone walls .
Open up and say , " Lord , I bows my head . "
He made you black , honey .
Don 't be tellin ' him his business .
Accept it , honey .
Do that for your mammy , your mother , dear .
Oh , my baby .
You back again ?
Hello , Elmer . Not staying for dinner ?
No . Do you realize what you 're doing ?
Don 't you know you 're spoiling one of the best businesswomen in New York ?
Me ? And ruining a great business ?
Oh , Elmer , you overrate my powers .
Ever since the night I introduced you here , what 's it been ?
Paradise .
Yeah . Not for the stockholders .
You 're overly sensitive about them .
Stockholders don 't expect anything anymore .
They 've been trained not to .
In the name of the National Recovery Act , will you let her have a day free ... so we can get some office work done at the office ?
Is that the only reason you want me to leave her alone ?
You 'd make a great undertaker .
My , Miss Bea , you sure do look beautiful !
Thank you , Delilah .
Do you like my dress ?
Mmm ! It ain 't your dress . It 's more than that .
It 's in your eyes and your cheeks .
It 's come to you , Miss Bea .
What 's come ? Has he gotten very far yet ?
Delilah , you 're a matchmaker at heart .
There 's Mr. Archer now .
Miss Bea , when you sits on the sofa , sit to this end , thisaway , not to that end , thataway .
What are you talking about ?
I 's done put my bestest rabbit foot underneath the pillow .
Hello , Stephen .
What are you laughing at ? Tell me so I can laugh too .
I wouldn 't dare now .
Perhaps later .
It 's a century since I saw you last .
Four hours .
Look at your lovely flowers .
It 's so nice of you to send them to me every day .
Bea , down the river there , you can 't see it because it 's beyond the bend , my boat is waiting .
In 10 days , you can be drifting in a tropic sea ... under a night sky of the most unbelievable blue .
All full of stars that burn warmly .
And so close , you can almost take them in your hands .
I know it sounds too poetic , but so help me it 's true !
You 'd glide past mysterious little islands , black and silent .
And in the water under your feet , you 'd see sudden shining streaks of phosphorescence like shooting stars .
Flying fish .
And on the shore breeze , there 'd come to you ... the perfume of warm lands : Hyacinth , jasmine .
And there isn 't a sound .
It 's all silent .
All my life , I 've never known silence .
There are seven telephones on my desk . I hear them ringing even in my sleep .
Down there we don 't have telephones ... or conferences or stockholders ' meetings .
The only businessmen are the sharks .
They 're the collectors . Only they don 't collect , they just glide by .
It sounds like paradise .
It is paradise .
It could be if ...
Bea , I haven 't made a mistake about you , have I ?
You do like me ?
Like you ?
Uh-uh .
I love you , Stephen .
Oh , Bea ! I 've loved you from the first minute when I looked out the window ... and you were having such an awful time with the doorbell .
Darling !
Let 's not wait very long .
Let 's be married soon . Whenever you like .
Oh , my dear !
Before you know it , we 'll be on the bridge of my boat sailing down the bay .
Destination ?
Wherever we feel like going .
With you , anywhere !
Um . Oh , I forgot .
What ?
There 's Jessie .
What about Jessie ?
She 'll be home in a few days for her vacation .
Well ?
Stephen , will you do something for me ?
Of course !
Anything . Let 's keep it a secret for a while .
Let 's not tell Jessie anything about you and me , not at first .
Whatever you say .
I want her to know you and like you before she finds out about us .
You see , Jessie and I , we 've always been together , just the two of us .
Don 't you worry .
Just leave Jessie to me .
I 'll be so nice to her that by the time we 're ready to break the news , she 'll be begging you to marry me .
I 'm sure she will .
Hello , Jarvis .
How do you do , sir ?
Miss Pullman is in the drawing room .
Yeah ? Hello !
Hello .
Oh , I beg your pardon . I thought Mrs. Pullman was here .
I 'm Jessie Pullman .
Won 't you come in ?
But ...
But it ...
What ?
But you 're supposed to be just a little girl .
But I 'm not !
Look .
Oh , that 's an old picture .
Mother will keep it out .
I 'm going to have some new ones made .
I am Stephen Archer .
I 'm a friend of your mother 's .
Do sit down . Mother should be here any minute .
She wasn 't expecting me until tomorrow .
So I understood . How long 's your vacation to be ?
Oh , you know it 's a vacation ?
I know a lot about you , except how big you are .
I love vacations .
This one 's only two weeks .
But I expect to squeeze every minute out of it .
I couldn 't get home fast enough to be with Mother .
Mother !
Darling !
Darling !
Mother !
Mmm ! When did you get here ?
About 3 : 00 .
Why didn 't you let me know ?
I wanted to surprise you .
I had a chance to motor down with Janie Prentice .
I thought you wouldn 't be through with your exams until today .
I was supposed to take one in algebra this morning , but I would have flunked anyway , so I didn 't see any reason for staying .
If it 's algebra , I don 't care . But don 't tell me you failed in anything else ?
Oh , no , I was a very bright child .
Passed in everything else .
Mother , could I change from English composition to dramatics next term ?
Yes , darling .
Let me look at you !
Good heavens !
How you 've grown !
I 'll say .
None of my clothes fit me anymore .
Going to have to have some new ones .
Oh , I can 't bear it .
My little girl 's grown up .
It 's too dreadful .
Mother , may I go to your dressmaker this time ?
I feel so silly in these simple things .
We 'll see . And I need a new riding habit for the horse show .
You 're coming up for it , aren 't you ?
I don 't know .
I 'll try .
You ...
Oh , Stephen , I 'm so sorry .
This is my daughter .
We 're old friends .
Mr. Archer and I have been talking .
Oh ! He 's an ichthyologist .
Do you know what that is ?
Why , Mother , what do you think I go to school for ?
Oh , I beg your pardon !
I 'm dying for my tea .
Will you tell Jarvis ?
Of course . - Did you see Delilah ?
- Yes , I 've seen everyone .
Isn 't she sweet ?
Her mother all over again .
Oh . It seems I can 't do without you even for a little while .
Even for the few minutes I do go to the office .
Mmm , sweet .
Oh , Stephen , isn 't she big ?
She 's tall , but she 's just a baby .
I 'm going to forget about the office while Jessie 's in town .
We 'll give her one round of gaiety :
Dinners , theaters , restaurants .
You 'll help me , won 't you ?
Of course I will .
Ichthyologist .
Ichthyologist .
Ichthyologist .
L-C-H ...
Ichthyologist .
Ichthyologist . " One who makes a study of ... fish . "
Fish ?
Here 's your tea , darling .
No , thanks .
I really don 't care for any .
No ? Well , I 'm gonna swallow mine and go freshen up a bit .
Not even one of these ?
No , thank you .
Mr. Archer and I are going to give you a whirl to take the taste of school out of your mouth . I 'm going to play hooky from the office too .
That 'll be grand !
Mr. Archer 's idea .
He says he 'll be proud to take us about .
I will , indeed .
We 're going to have a marvelous time .
You and Stephen can plan what plays you 'd like to see while I 'm dressing .
Well , have you any suggestions about plays ?
Do you know what 's on ? I 'm afraid I don 't .
I 'll have to look over the list .
But I 'm very much interested in ichthyology .
Are you ? That 's very flattering .
Take , for instance , the habits of the sea mew .
Is the sea mew the same family ...
I 'm afraid you have me stumped there .
You see , my subject is fish . The sea mew is a bird .
But that 's a perfectly natural mistake .
The sea mew ought to be a fish .
I 'm caught , aren 't I ?
The very first crack .
It takes a bit of doing to tell the birds from the fish .
I suppose I 'd better confess .
Oh , do .
But I read so fast , I couldn 't remember .
A better way for you to learn about ichthyology would be to see my private aquarium .
Could I ?
I 'd love to . When may I come ?
Would tomorrow be too soon ?
Tomorrow would be perfect .
Come in .
Hello , Delilah .
Excuse me , Miss Bea .
I hope I ain 't bothering ya .
What is it ?
I 'm in trouble again .
Peola . She 's left the school .
Oh , Delilah !
I 'm sure it 's not as bad as you think .
But it 's four days now since she left the school , and she ain 't come home .
We 'll go down there .
We won 't leave a stone unturned until we find her .
Mother !
Darling , I 'm so sorry .
I 've got to go away for a few days .
Delilah has had some bad news .
Peola 's disappeared from the school , so I 've got to go down there with her .
What do you suppose ...
We don 't know anything more , darling .
I 'm sorry . Anything I can do ?
Yes .
Will you take care of Jessie ?
I 'll do my best .
There 's Delilah now .
Poor Delilah .
I 'll go speak to her .
Yes , do .
I 'm awfully sorry , Delilah .
I know everything 's going to be all right .
If anything happens to that child , I just get sick all over .
I hate to run away , but if you could have seen Delilah 's face ...
I understand .
I 'll say good-bye here .
Good-bye , darling .
Telegraph me often .
Yes , I will , darling .
I wish I could go with you .
I wish you could too , but there 's Jessie .
I know .
By the time you get back , Jessie and I will be great friends .
I 'm sure you will .
Good evening , madam .
Good evening , sir .
Two , please .
Certainly .
This way , please .
This must be the place .
There she is , Miss Bea !
How do you like your new job ?
Very much , thank you .
Thank you .
Give me one of those .
Yes .
What can I do for you ?
Peola .
We 've been looking everywhere for you .
Are you talking to me ?
There must be some mistake .
My name isn 't Peola .
There ain 't no mistake .
Why have you got this job ?
You don 't have to work .
I 'll give you everything you want .
What are you talking about ?
I 'm sure you 've got me confused with someone else .
Why , Peola child !
I 'm your mammy !
Why , that 's ridiculous !
I never saw you before in my life !
What 's the meaning of this ?
Do I look like her daughter ?
Do I look like I could be her daughter ?
Why , she must be crazy !
Peola ! How can you talk to your mother that way ?
Come on , Delilah .
Come on .
Brace up , Delilah .
Everything will turn out all right .
We 'll find her again .
Miss Bea , there she is !
She 's back .
Peola 's come home .
She 's back home .
Baby !
My little lamb . Oh .
Peola , you 're back !
Yes , Mother .
And I want to tell you how sorry I am for what I did to you .
Oh , that 's all right .
Come , come , baby , and sit down .
It don 't feel like you 're really here standing ' so far off .
Mother , I 've done everything you wanted me to .
I went to that school and tried to be happy there to please you .
But I couldn 't bear it .
I couldn 't ! I had to get away !
I understand , baby .
We 're gonna forget all about it now .
It 's all right .
But it isn 't all right .
I want to talk to you .
I 'll go upstairs , Delilah .
No , Miss Bea .
You stay , please . I want you to hear too .
What 's my little baby got on her mind ?
I want to go away .
Go away ? Go where , Peola ?
I mean ...
by that I mean I want to go away .
And you mustn 't see me or own me ... or claim me or anything .
I mean , even if you passed me on the street , you 'll have to pass me by .
No , Peola !
I know it 's terrible of me , Miss Bea .
But you don 't know what it is to look white and be black .
You don 't know .
I can 't go on this way any longer .
I can 't give up my baby .
I bore ya . I nursed ya .
I love ya .
I love ya more than you can guess .
You can 't ask your mammy to do this !
You 've got to promise me , Mother .
I 'm your mammy , child !
I ain 't no white mother !
It 's too much to ask of me .
I ain 't got the spiritual strength to meet it .
I can 't hang on no cross !
I ain 't got the strength .
You can 't ask me to unborn my own child .
I 'm sorry , Mother .
I know it 's asking a lot , but I 've got to live my own life .
Good-bye .
Peola , how can you hurt your mother so ?
How can you make her suffer this way ?
I 'm sorry , Miss Bea , but I can 't help it !
Don 't cry , Delilah .
Don 't cry .
She 'll come back to you .
Give her a little time .
A few hard knocks , and she 'll come running back to her mother .
That 's what mothers are for !
She 'll remember that you 're here to turn to .
No , Miss Bea .
I 've lost my baby .
She won 't ever come back .
Of course she will !
I 'm going to get Julie to fix you a cup of tea .
And I 'll be down again in a few minutes .
Thank you , Miss Bea .
I 'll be all right .
Mother ! Hello .
Darling , you 're back !
Yes , darling .
We came in downstairs .
Peola 's here , you know .
Yes , I saw her .
I 've missed you so .
You 've been gone such a long time .
Mmm . Five days .
It was only supposed to be two .
What 's the matter ?
You look troubled . I am troubled .
I 've just seen such a tragedy .
Poor Delilah !
What did Peola do ?
She 's gone .
She 's gone away .
Disowned her mother .
Oh , how dreadful !
Darling , if ever anything should ever come between us , it would kill me .
Nothing can , Mother .
We must see that it doesn 't .
Don 't be silly . There 's no reason .
Come sit down a minute .
How much have you missed me ?
Lots , of course .
But not as much as I might have if Stephen hadn 't taken your place .
Oh , so I 've been supplanted , have I ?
But you have got on well ?
Oh , have we !
We 've dined out every night and danced , seen three plays and two picture galleries and the Bronx Park Zoo .
Well !
Your ichthyologist is grand .
I think we ought to keep him in the family .
He thinks you 're beautiful .
He said so . Did he ?
Mm-hmm . He thinks I 'm nice too .
Mother , why do I have to go back to school ?
What 's this ?
Well , after all ...
Too much vacation .
You don 't want me to turn out to be a stuffy intellectual , do you ?
I have no very serious fears about that , my sweet .
After all , what 's the good of algebra and all that stuff to a girl ?
This sounds very suspicious to me .
You sure you haven 't some handsome football captain in hiding ?
No , he isn 't a football captain .
But there is someone !
I 'll have to look into that .
Right now I want a tub .
I 'm so sticky after my night on the train .
Right , darling .
And I 'm going out .
Where ?
Just out .
Oh , out !
I see . Out 's a big place .
Be back in an hour or two .
See that you are .
I 've just begun to talk to you .
Hello .
Hello , Stephen .
This is Bea .
Oh , hello , Bea !
I 'm so glad you 're back .
When can I come over ?
I 'm just getting into the tub . Give me half an hour .
Jessie tells me you 've played the beau in grand style .
She 's a most appealing little person , half child and half woman .
I 've had a delightful time .
Hurry with that bath , will you ?
I 'll be waiting for you .
Good-bye , dear .
Hello .
Well , if it isn 't the night prowler herself .
I didn 't think you 'd get up at all today .
Wasn 't it too dreadful , getting home in broad daylight like that ?
I never enjoyed anything so much in my life .
No repentance ?
Not now .
I 'll probably have plenty of repenting to do when Mother finds out .
She got home an hour ago . Yes , I know .
I 've just been talking to her on the phone .
I 'm going over there as soon as I get through fixing Horace .
Oh .
Want to come along and have a look at Horace ?
I thought Horace was a new species , but he 's turned out to be just an ordinary crab .
Stephen , I 've just told Mother I don 't want to go back to school .
No ? Why not ?
I want to stay here .
Stephen , what do you think of me ?
I think you 're just about the nicest child I 've ever known .
Now , don 't you begin that child stuff !
At 37 , anything under 20 seems a babe in arms .
I think 37 is the ideal age .
Don 't you believe it . It 's a dreadful age .
Well , I like it .
You know , I think I like the ones with the big claw best .
Mmm , the bachelors .
Poor lonely hearts .
Why don 't you put a lady crab in with them ?
They 'd tear each other to pieces over her .
How romantic ! For the winner .
He becomes a married crab ?
For the time being at least .
Divorce is common ?
Statistics show about the same percentage as in the United States .
You 're a nut .
Excuse me .
When I marry , I 'm never going to be divorced .
How do you know ?
Just that ... when a girl like me falls in love , it 's forever , forever and ever .
What makes you so sure ?
Because I am in love .
You are ?
Well , don 't you think you might 've told me ?
Is he handsome ?
Stephen , it 's you .
I love you .
Jessie , my dear ...
It 's true !
I do love you !
Do you think it 's fair to make sport of your elders ?
I 'm not ! I 'm serious , Stephen , terribly serious .
Oh , no , you 're not .
You 're just a baby .
Oh .
Stephen , we did have fun together , didn 't we ?
I thought so .
Grand fun .
That night we rode on the ferry to Staten Island , on the top deck under the stars .
And last night , in the open barouche , driving up Fifth Avenue .
That was fun , wasn 't it ?
For you , I mean .
You bet it was .
No , it wasn 't !
You were just putting yourself out to be nice to a child !
A perfectly silly child !
Jessie !
Hello , dear .
You didn 't stay long , did you ?
No , I ...
I 'm just going down to see Delilah .
Jarvis .
How do you do , sir ?
Oh , Stephen !
I 'm so glad to see you !
It 's great to have you back again .
Jessie just came in ahead of you , or have you two come in together ?
I stopped in at Stephen 's apartment .
I wanted to see how Eph and Maggie were .
Eph and Maggie ?
Who in the world are they ?
They 're two of the crabs .
Oh , now , don 't tell me you 've named them !
Oh , yes , they all have names .
One 's Elmer .
And one 's named Fanny .
You didn 't know I was getting to be quite an ichthyologist myself .
That 's splendid .
Mrs. Pullman , can you come right away ?
It 's Delilah .
Oh , yes .
Excuse me .
Better now ?
Yes 'm , Miss Bea .
I just somehow ... give out all of a sudden .
'Tain 't nothin ' .
You go upstairs .
Mary here , she 'll do for me fine .
I 'm going to stay right here until you 're feeling better .
Delilah , if there 's anything you want ...
Thank you , Miss Bea .
There is somethin ' .
I want me a good funeral .
What ?
Delilah , what are you talking about ?
You 're going to be all right .
No , Miss Bea .
I 'm all through now .
But that 's all right .
I ain 't a-worryin ' much .
If the Lord is ready , 'tain 't for me to hesitate .
Oh , no .
Delilah , I just couldn 't do without you .
None of us could .
That 's awful sweet of you to say , Miss Bea .
I appreciate it .
But about my funeral .
All right , what about it ?
I 'll promise you the finest funeral in the world , only you must get well first .
Yes 'm .
I paid my dues regular in all my lodges . And I 'm a church member in good standing ' .
And I do want a long procession .
I hope all the lodges turn out in full .
And I hope it don 't rain .
I want to go meet my maker with plenty of bands playin ' .
I want to ride up to heaven ... in a white velvet hearse .
Silk velvet .
Purple satin inside the casket .
I wants them colored folks ' eyes to bulge out .
And another thing .
I want horses to the hearse .
I don 't like the smell of gasoline .
Delilah , you 'll have everything you want , but not for years and years to come .
Oh , you . You and your processions .
Let me tell you some good news .
What , Miss Bea ?
I 'm going to be married .
Why , Miss Bea !
You see why you 've got to get well just as quickly as you can ?
Married !
The rabbit 's foot did do some good after all , didn 't it ?
This way , Doctor , please .
Here 's the doctor to see you .
Good evening , Mrs. Pullman .
Good evening , Doctor .
Well , how 's the famous Aunt Delilah ?
Doctor , this big mountain lying here thinks she isn 't going to get well .
We 'll have to get her out of that notion .
Better get her undressed .
I 'll see you before you leave .
Very good .
Why didn 't you tell me ?
Because your mother asked me not to until ...
Until I knew you better , and learned to like you .
Well , I did , didn 't I ?
I think I 'll go and come back later .
Will you tell your mother ?
Yes .
Good-bye , Jessie .
Good-bye .
Stephen .
How 's Delilah ?
I don 't know .
The doctor 's still with her .
Are you going ?
Yes .
I was going to run along and dress and come back for you in about an hour .
Is that all right ?
Stephen ...
Do you mind if I don 't go to dinner ?
Of course not .
I 'm dreadfully tired , more than I realized .
After the trip and all that 's happened today .
I understand .
You go to bed early and get a good night 's rest .
I 'll see you tomorrow .
Yes .
Tomorrow night for dinner .
Yes .
Good night , dear .
Good night .
Oh , there you are , Mother .
Hello , dear .
I like your dress .
It 's one I got while you were away .
It 's very nice .
Stephen not here yet ?
No .
Come sit down .
Mother , would you mind terribly if I went back to school the end of the week ?
Darling , what 's the matter ?
Aren 't you enjoying your vacation ?
Yes , it 's been nice , but ...
Then what is it ?
You still have another week .
And only yesterday you were asking me why you ever had to go back to school at all .
I was just talking then .
I really do like school .
And I 've been thinking , if I do a lot of cramming , I could ...
Mother , may I go to Switzerland to finish my last two years ?
Switzerland ?
Yes .
A lot of the girls go .
Even Janie Prentice is talking about it .
There really are a lot of advantages in going .
Switzerland ...
Mr. Smith .
Show him in .
Hello , Jessie .
Hello , Elmer .
Hello , Elmer .
Well , there you are .
You dodging me ?
What have I done ?
What are you talking about ?
I 've been trying to get in touch with you for the last 24 hours .
You won 't come near the office , and you won 't answer the telephone .
All I can get is the butler , and I can 't penetrate past him .
You 're too busy !
You 're tired !
You can 't be disturbed !
I 'd never known about Delilah except through the butler .
Why have you gone into the silence ?
What 's it all about ?
Elmer , what is it you want ?
I dropped in to tell you that unless we move in the matter of national brands , the deal is going to be called off .
Well , let it !
But they 're willing to meet our demands .
You turn the management over to them and keep 50 % of the stock .
That relieves you of all responsibility .
And there 's more money in it than you can possibly think of .
In fact , there 's more money than I can pronounce without stuttering .
Would you like to hear me try ?
I don 't want to sell .
What ?
I don 't want to give up active management .
What 's the matter ?
Before you went south , you couldn 't sell quick enough .
I 've changed my mind !
You wanted to get from behind that desk , be a human being !
I 'm not going to sell !
Isn 't that sufficient ?
But , Bea ...
Must I always give you an account of everything I do or don 't do ?
Bea .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
Forgive me , Elmer .
I really don 't know what I 'm saying .
I 'm so worried and unhappy .
Is it Delilah ?
Yes .
Yes , of course it 's Delilah .
Elmer , did you see much of Jessie while I was away ?
She came to the office a couple of times . Needed money .
Alone ?
Steve was with her .
Why ?
Nothing .
I just wondered . That 's all .
Hello .
May I come in ? Hello , Stephen !
Is he boarding here ?
Hello , Steve .
Are you following me ?
Every time I come here I find you .
You might do worse .
Might .
Well , so long .
Good night , Bea .
I hope in the morning you 'll have better news of Delilah .
Thank you , Elmer .
Hello .
You look so worried , dear .
Isn 't Delilah feeling any better ?
No , she 's much worse .
If we could only find Peola .
She keeps calling for her over and over .

So have I. I want to talk to you about Jessie .
Mother .
Mother , the doctor wants you to come quickly .

That 's good .
But I 'm going ... across Jordan ... pretty soon now .
Peola ?
Peola !
Doctor , leave me have her picture , please ?
It never done her justice .
Miss Bea ?
Yes , darling , what is it ?
Miss Bea , try and find my baby .
Yes , darling .
If she gets in any troubles , you 'll see her through ' em .
Of course I will .
Ain 't nothin ' bad about Peola .
She didn 't mean to harm me when she turned away .
No , of course she didn 't .
Just tell her a right sweet good-bye .
Tell her to be a good girl .
Why , Peola ain 't ... little more than a baby now .

I didn 't mean it , Mother .
Can 't you forgive me ?
Peola .
Peola .
I killed you .
Peola , come on .
Miss Bea , I killed my own mother .
Don 't talk like that .
Come with us .
Step back . All right , folks .
Step back , please .
She worked for me , slaved for me .
Always thought of me first , never of herself .
Bea .
You 're so lovely .
Oh !
Darling , let 's not wait any longer .
Let 's be married right away , tomorrow , and go away on my boat as we planned to do .
Away from business and worry .
What 's the matter ?
Jessie 's in love with you , isn 't she ?
Oh .
She 's told you ?
No , she didn 't have to .
I knew .
I think I knew right away when I came back from Virginia .
I hope you don 't think that I ...
Oh , no , no .
I don 't , not now . It just happened .
It isn 't serious .
Just a childish infatuation .
She 'll get over it .
No , not if I marry you , darling .
What are you saying ?
I 'm trying to say that we can 't go on as we planned .
Bea , you can 't mean that .
She 'll forget all about me the first attractive boy that comes along .
Don 't you see , darling , right now you 're the man she loves .
If I were to marry you , she 'd always feel I 'd come between her and her happiness .
But she 's going back to school next week .
She 'll find new interests . Soon she 'll laugh at this as a schoolgirl crush .
Oh , no , darling .
Don 't you see ?
If you 're here with me , she 'll keep on thinking about you .
She won 't even want to come home , where the three of us would have to be together .
And the thought of her unhappiness would come between you and me .
I won 't give you up like this .
I love you .
Stephen , I love you more than I ever thought it possible to love anyone .
Then , Bea ...
Don 't , darling .
Please don 't make it any harder for me .
You must see how impossible it is .
Stephen , go back to your islands .
And when she forgets you , I 'll come to you no matter where you are if you still want me .
I shall always want you .
Then I 'll come .
Let 's say good-bye .
Mother ?
Yes , dear ?
Where 's Stephen ?
Isn 't he staying for dinner ?
No , darling .
Look what I found in the library , tucked away in the corner of the couch .
Delilah 's rabbit 's foot .
She must 've put it there for good luck .
Dear Delilah .
Peola 's decided to go back to school .
That 's good .
That 's what Delilah would 've wanted for her .
When did you first meet Delilah ?
Oh , a long time ago .
You were just about two .
I 'll never forget that morning .
I was giving you a bath , getting you ready for the day nursery .
Why are you laughing ?
You kept yelling , " I want my quack-quack ! "
Mother , I didn 't .
Yes , you did .
I can hear you now .
" I want my quack-quack !
I want my quack-quack ! "
Hunger strike ?
How long has this been going on ?
She hasn 't had a thing yesterday or today .
- Sending meals up to her regularly ?
- Yes , sir .
Why don 't you jam it down her throat ?
It 's not that simple , Mr. Andrews .
I 'll talk to her myself .
Have some food brought up to her .
Yes , sir .
I won 't eat a thing until you let me off this boat .
Come now , Ellie .
You know I 'll have my way .
Not this time , you won 't !
I 'm already married to him .
You 'll never live under the same roof with him .
I 'll see to it .
Get it through your head , King Westley and I are married !
Definitely , legally , actually married !
It 's over , it 's finished .
There 's not a thing you can do about it .
I 'm over 21 and so is he .
While you 've been onboard I 've arranged to have your marriage annulled .
Annulled . I 'll have something to say about that and so will King .
I expect him to .
The vittles . Come in .
I told you not to bring any food in here .
Now wait a minute . This isn 't for you .
Put it down here .
Smart , aren 't you ? So subtle .
Strategy , my dear .
Was it strategy sending those gorillas to drag me away from the Justice of the Peace ?
Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe .
I 've won many arguments that way .
Besides not liking him , you haven 't got a thing against King .
- He 's a fake .
- He 's one of the best flyers in the country .
He 's no good .
You married him because I said not to .
You 're always telling me what not to do .
Because you 've always been a stubborn idiot .
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots .
Don 't shout so .
You may work up an appetite .
I 'll shout if I want to !
I 'll scream if I want to !
All right , scream .
Let me off this boat or I 'll break every piece of furniture in here !
Here , now .
Have a nice piece of juicy steak .
You don 't have to eat it .
Just smell it .
It 's a poem .
Lower the boats !
Catch her !
Come on , men !
She got away , sir .
Of course , she 's too smart for you .
Send a wireless to the Lovington Detective Agency .
" Daughter escaped again .
" Watch roads , airports and train stations in Miami . "
Palm Beach , Savannah , Jacksonville New York , Philadelphia . All aboard !
We 're wasting our time .
Imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus .
I told the old man it was bunk .
Ticket for New York , please .
- Here 's your ticket .
- Thank you very much .
Thank you .
What 's going on here ?
I 'd like to use that phone .
Go away .
This is history in the making .
- What ?
- There 's a man biting a dog in there .
Heel , boy .
I can 't stand this any longer .
In a pig 's eye , you will .
Listen monkey face , when you fired me , you fired the best news hound your filthy scandal sheet ever had .
You wouldn 't know a newspaper story if it kicked you in the pants .
I got all your copy .
Why didn 't you tell me you were gonna write it in Greek ?
I 'd start a new department .
That was free verse , you gas house palooka .
What was free about it ?
It cost this paper a gob of dough .
And it 's not going to cost us any more !
Did you know he reversed the charge ?
What ?
Why you ...
When you get back to New York , you keep far away from this office .
You 're fired .
You don 't work here anymore and you never will .
What 'd he say ?
So , you 're changing your tune ?
You 're late with your apologies .
I wouldn 't go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees !
I hope this 'll be a lesson to you .
Did we tell that baby ?
- We don 't need anymore of his lip .
- You told him , Pete .
I guess he knows now , how I feel about his job .
I bet he does , too .
Is my chariot ready ?
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth , mighty King .
- Lead on , sire .
- Make way for the king .
Make way for the king .
Long live the king .
Philadelphia , all aboard !
Step down Marty , King is back .
On the rack in the back .
It 's your goodbye chariot .
Make hams of you and scram !
Two thousand miles is a long trip .
Make yourself comfortable with a pleasant pillow .
Pillow , sir ?
Driver !
If you 'll be good enough to move those newspapers , I 'll have a seat .
Hey , wait a minute !
What do you think you 're doing ?
The papers . What 's the idea of throwing them out ?
The papers ? It 's a long story , my friend .
I never did like the idea of sitting on newspapers .
I did it once , and all the headlines came off on my white pants .
It actually happened .
Nobody bought a paper that day .
They followed me all over town and read the news off the seat of my pants .
A fresh guy .
What you need is a good sock on the nose .
Listen partner , you may not like my nose , but I do .
I always wear it out in the open so if anybody wants to take a sock at it , they can .
Yeah ?
Now , that 's a brilliant answer .
Why didn 't I think of it ?
Our conversation could have been over long ago .
Yeah ?
If you keep that up , we won 't get anywhere .
Yeah ?
You got me .
Yeah !
Excuse me , lady .
But that upon which you sit is mine .
I beg your pardon ?
Now listen , I put up a stiff fight for that seat .
So , if it 's just the same to you , scram .
Driver , are these seats reserved ?
- No .
First come , first serve .
- Thank you .
These seats accommodate two people , don 't they ?
Maybe they do , maybe they don 't .
Thank you .
Move over .
This is a " maybe they do . "
If you 'd ask me real nice , I might put that bag up there for you .
Next time you drop in , bring your folks .
Get some !
Come on , everybody !
Hot dogs , folks !
Rest station , 15 minutes . We 'll only be here 15 minutes .
Red hot coffee !
Right around there .
Get the red hot coffee !
Hot dogs !
Can 't enjoy the ride unless you eat !
He got away .
I found myself in the middle of brush and no sign of the skunk .
I don 't know what you 're raving about , young man .
- Furthermore , I 'm not interested .
- Well of all the ...
Maybe you 'll be interested to know your bag is gone .
My heavens !
It 's gone !
I knew you 'd catch on eventually .
- What am I going to do now ?
- Don 't tell me your ticket was in it .
No , got that all right .
But not my money .
All I have here is $ 4 .
You can wire home for money in Jacksonville .
No , I can 't .
- Yes , I guess I will .
- I 'll tell the driver about your bag .
Thank you , I 'd rather you didn 't .
Don 't be a fool .
You 've lost your bag .
The company should pay for it .
- What 's your name ?
- I don 't want it reported !
That 's silly .
The company will take care of it .
Can you understand English ?
Would you please keep out of my affairs ?
I want to be left alone .
Why , you ungrateful brat .
Board !
All aboard !
Jacksonville , 30 minutes for breakfast .
Only 30 minutes for breakfast .
Just 30 minutes . That 's all . No more .
Read all about it !
I 'm so sorry .
Silly , isn 't it ?
Why , everybody 's gone !
Thank you for that , very much .
- We 're in Jacksonville , aren 't we ?
- Yes .
That was foolish of me .
Why didn 't you shove me away ?
I hated to wake you up .
You look kind of pretty asleep .
How about some breakfast ?
No thank you .
No , I 'm going to the Windsor Hotel .
Windsor ?
You 'll never make it in time .
We leave in a half an hour .
No , they 'll wait for me .
Driver , I 'm going to be a few minutes late .
Be sure to wait for me .
Yeah ?
Yes .
Where 's the bus to New York ?
It left about 20 minutes ago .
But that 's ridiculous .
I was on that bus .
I told them to wait .
I 'm sorry , miss , but it 's gone .
Good morning .
Remember me ?
I 'm the fellow you slept on last night .
Seems to me , I 've already thanked you for that .
What time 's the next bus ?
8 : 00 tonight .
8 : 00 ?
That 's 12 hours .
Sorry , miss .
What 's wrong ?
Wouldn 't the old meanies wait for you ?
Why are you so excited ?
You missed it , too .
Yeah , I missed it too .
Don 't tell me you did it on my account .
I hope you haven 't any idea that what happened last night is ...
Young man , you needn 't concern yourself about me .
I can take care of myself .
You 're doing a pretty sloppy job of it .
Here 's your ticket .
My ticket ?
I found it on the seat .
Thank you .
It must have fallen out of my purse .
You 'll never get away with it , Miss Andrews .
- What are you talking about ?
- You won 't get away with it .
Your father will stop you before you get halfway to New York .
You must have me confused with someone else .
Quit kidding .
It 's all over the front page .
I 've always been curious to know what kind of a girl would marry a front-page aviator like King Westley .
Take my advice .
Grab the next bus back to Miami .
That guy 's a phoney .
I didn 't ask for your advice .
That 's right . You didn 't .
You 're not going to notify my father , are you ?
What for ?
You probably could get some money out of him .
I never thought of that .
If you promise not to do it , I 'll pay you as much as he will .
You won 't gain a thing by giving me up .
I 'm willing to make it worth your while .
I 've got to get to New York without being stopped .
It 's very important to me .
I 'd pay you now , only all I had when I jumped off the yacht was a watch .
I had to pawn it to get these clothes .
I 'll give you my address .
You can contact me in New York .
Never mind .
I had you pegged right from the jump .
Just the spoiled brat of a rich father .
The only way you get anything is to buy it .
You 're in a jam and all you can think of is your money . It never fails , does it ?
Ever hear of the word " humility " ?
No , you wouldn 't .
It never occurred to you to say " Please , Mister , I 'm in trouble .
Will you help me ? "
That 'd bring you down off your high horse .
I 'll tell you something to ease your mind .
You don 't have to worry about me .
I 'm not interested in your money or your problem .
You , King Westley , your father . You 're all a lot of hooey to me .
You send telegrams here ?
I 'm just fine , thanks .
And how are you ?
" To Joe Gordon , in care of New York Mail , New York .
" Am I laughing .
The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap .
" I know where Ellen Andrews is . " No , do you really ?
Go on . Send the telegram .
" How would you like to have the story ?
You big tub of ... "
Mush .
" Tub of mush .
Well , try and get it .
" What I said about never writing another line for you still goes .
" Are you burning ?
Peter Warne . "
That 'll be $ 2.60 .
- Send it collect .
- Collect ?
Collect .
Bus leaving for Savannah , Charleston , Columbia , Greensboro , Richmond Washington , Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York ...
Hi , sister . All alone ?
My name 's Shapeley .
May as well get acquainted , it 's a long trip .
Gets tiresome .
Especially for somebody like you .
You look like you 've got class .
Yes , with a capital " K " . I 'm the guy that knows class when he sees it .
Believe you me .
Ask any of the boys . They 'll tell you .
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them .
Shapeley 's the name and that 's the way I like them .
You made no mistake sitting next to me .
Most girls you meet on the bus ain 't nothing to write home to the wife about .
You gotta be awful careful who you hit it up with .
You can 't be too particular , neither .
What 's the matter , you ain 't saying much ?
Seems to me you 're doing excellently without any assistance .
That 's pretty good . " Seems to me you 're doing excellently without any assistance . "
Well shut my big , nasty mouth .
Looks like you 're one up on me .
There 's nothing I like better than to meet a high-class mama that can snap back at you .
The colder they are , the hotter they get .
That 's what I always say .
Yes , sir .
When a cold mama gets hot , boy how she sizzles .
Now you 're just my type .
Believe me , sister , I could go for you in a big way .
" Fun-on-the-side Shapeley , " they call me .
With accent on the " fun " . Believe you me .
Believe you me , you bore me to distraction .
Looks like you 're two up on me now .
Hey , you .
- There 's a seat over there for you .
- What 's the idea ?
I 'd like to sit next to my wife , if you don 't mind .
- Your wife ?
- Yes .
Come on .
Yeah .
Sure , excuse me .
You know , I was just ...
Sure . Excuse me , miss .
I was just trying to make things pleasant .
Excuse me , I ...
I didn 't mean anything , Doc .
- No offence , Doc . - No .
If you promise not to snap my head off , I 'd like to thank you .
Forget it .
I didn 't do it for you .
His voice gets on my nerves .
What 'd you do all day ?
Ran in and out of doorways . Trying to keep out of the rain .
Your clothes are all wet .
Here .
You 're as helpless as a baby .
Thank you .
Here you are , folks .
Cigars , cigarettes , chewing gum , candy , magazines .
Here , boy .
- Yes , ma 'am .
- A box of chocolates , please .
- Never mind . She doesn 't want it .
- But ...
- Of course , I do . What do you mean ?
- Beat it .
Well , you 've got your nerve .
Here , boy !
$ 1.60 .
You had $ 4 last night .
How will you get to New York at this rate ?
That 's none of your business .
You 're on a budget from now on .
- Just a minute .
You can 't ...
- Shut up .
- What 's the matter , officer ?
- Bridge washed out .
Looks like we can 't get through till morning .
If any passengers want a place to sleep you 'll find an auto camp up yonder a piece .
- Where ?
- Right over there .
See those lights ?
Dyke 's Auto camp .
All right , thanks .
Hey , brat .
Are you talking to me ?
Yeah .
Come on , we 're stopping here for the night .
Hey !
Come on , we 're all set .
Good evening .
Hope you and your husband rest comfortable .
Come on !
What are you going to do , stay out there all night ?
Darn clever , these Armenians ?
Yeah , it 's a gift .
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband .
Yeah . I forgot to tell you about that .
I registered as Mr. And Mrs.
You did ?
What am I expected to do ?
Leap for joy ?
I kind of half expected you to thank me .
Your ego is absolutely colossal .
Yeah , it 's not bad .
How 's yours ?
You know , compared to you , my friend Shapeley 's an amateur .
Just whatever gave you any idea I 'd stand for this ?
Now wait a minute .
Let 's get this straightened out right now .
If you 're nursing any silly notion that I 'm interested in you , forget it .
You 're just a headline to me .
A headline ?
You 're not a newspaper man , are you ?
Chalk up one for your side .
Now listen .
You want to get to King Westley , don 't you ?
All right , I 'm here to help you .
What I want is your story .
Exclusive . A day-to-day account .
All about your mad fight to happiness .
I need that story .
Between you and me , I 've got to have it .
Isn 't that just too cute .
There 's a brain behind that face of yours , isn 't there ?
You 've got everything nicely figured out for yourself .
Including this .
This ?
Well , that 's a matter of simple mathematics .
These cabins cost $ 2 a night .
I 'm very sorry to inform you , wifey dear but the family purse won 't stand for our having separate establishment .
Thank you very much , sir .
You 've been very kind .
It 's all right with me . Go on out in the storm .
But I 'm going to follow you .
Yeah .
And if you get tough , I 'll just have to turn you over to your old man . Right now .
Savvy ?
That 's my whole plot in a nutshell .
A simple story for simple people .
You behave yourself , I 'll see you get to King Westley .
If not , I 'll just have to spill the beans to Papa .
Now , which of these beds do you prefer ?
This one ?
All right .
That , I suppose , makes everything quite all right .
This ?
I like privacy when I retire .
Yes , I 'm very delicate in that respect .
Prying eyes annoy me .
Behold the walls of Jericho .
Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet . But a lot safer .
You see , I have no trumpet .
Now to show you my heart 's in the right place I 'll give you my best pair of pyjamas .
Do you mind joining the Israelites ?
You don 't want to join the Israelites ?
All right . Perhaps you 're interested in how a man undresses .
There 's a funny thing about that .
Quite a study in psychology .
No two men do it alike .
I once knew a man who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed .
Now he made a picture .
Years later , his secret came out .
He wore a toupee .
I have a method all my own .
If you 'll notice , the coat came first . Then the tie .
Then the shirt .
Now , according to Hoyle , after that the pants should be next .
There 's where I 'm different .
I go for the shoes next .
First the right .
Then the left .
After that , it 's every man for himself .
Still with me , brat ?
Don 't be a sucker .
A good night 's rest will do you a lot of good .
Besides , you got nothing to worry about .
The walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf .
" Who 's afraid of the big bad wolf ? The big bad wolf
" The big bad wolf
" She 's afraid of the big bad wolf Tra , la , la , la , la "
Would you mind please , putting out the light ?
No , not at all .
I wish you 'd take those things off the walls of Jericho .
Excuse me .
By the way , what 's your name ?
What 's that ?
Who are you ?
Who , me ?
I 'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night .
I 'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face .
You 've got a name , haven 't you ?
Yeah , I got a name .
Peter Warne .
I don 't like it .
Don 't let it bother you .
You 're giving it back to me in the morning .
Pleased to meet you , Mr. Warne .
The pleasure is all mine , Mrs. Warne .
- Another message , sir . - What is it ?
What is it ?
It 's from Charleston .
" Checking every northbound train .
" Also assigned 20 operators to watch main highways .
" No sign of her yet .
Will continue to do all possible .
" Signed , Lovington Detective Agency . "
It 's just the same as all the others .
- Yes , sir ?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York .
- What are we crawling for ?
- I got it wide open .
- All right , step on it .
- Yes , sir .
I hope she 's all right .
All right ? Of course , she 's all right .
What could happen to her ?
- Nothing , sir .
- Then shut up about it .
Hello ?
Hey , mister .
Hello .
What 's the matter , you not up yet ?
- What time is it ? - 8 : 00 .
Here .
It 's a toothbrush , thanks .
My dress , you had it pressed .
Come on . Breakfast will be ready soon .
You sweet thing .
Where 'd you get it pressed ?
I 'll count to 10 .
If you 're not out of bed by then I 'll drag you out myself .
- One , two , three , four , five ...
- I really think you would !
I 'm out !
I 'm out !
You 'll find the showers just behind the second cottage .
Outside ?
All the best homes have them outside .
I can 't go out like this .
- Like what ?
- Like this .
I have no robe .
Here , use mine .
Thanks .
Make it snappy .
Wait , it 's not my fault .
You got the sleeve .
- Here are my puppets .
- Thanks .
Where 'd you say the showers were ?
Here 's a towel .
Thank you .
You 're kind of little , aren 't you ?
Where 's the shower ?
Your hair 's cute like that .
You should never comb it .
I 'll find it myself .
Are the showers in there ?
They ain 't out here .
Thank you .
Can 't a body have a little privacy around here ?
You want a shower around here , you 'll stand in line .
Hi , sister .
You remember me , Shapeley ?
Say , I 'm sorry about last night .
Didn 't know you was married to that guy .
You should 've told me right off .
High time you got back .
I met some very interesting women at the showers .
We got chatting about this and that .
You know how time flies .
Come on .
Sit down .
My , my . Scrambled eggs .
Egg . One egg .
One donut , black coffee .
That 's your ration till lunch .
Any complaints ?
No . No complaints .
I 'd have cream for your coffee , but I 'd be buying a whole pint .
You don 't have to apologise to me .
You don 't know how much I appreciate all this .
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning ?
Must be the spring .
I thought maybe " believe you me " told you some more snappy stories .
No .
He apologised for last night .
Said he didn 't know we were married .
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be .
- Donut ?
- Thanks .
You think this whole business is silly ?
Running away and all .
No .
Makes too good a story .
Yes , you do .
You think I 'm a fool and a spoiled brat .
Perhaps I am .
Although , I don 't see how I can be .
Spoiled people are used to having their way .
I never have . On the contrary .
I 've always been told what to do and how to do it and when and with whom .
Can you believe , this is the first time I 've ever been alone with a man ?
Yeah .
It 's a wonder I 'm not panic-stricken .
You 're doing all right .
Thanks .
Nurses , governesses , chaperones , even bodyguards .
It 's been a lot of fun .
One consolation , you can never get lonesome .
It has its moments .
It 's become a sort of game , trying to outwit father 's detectives .
I did once . Actually went shopping without a bodyguard .
It was swell .
I felt absolutely immoral .
It didn 't last long , they found me in a department store .
I was so mad , I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw .
Guess who was in it ?
Santa Claus ?
Ghandi ?
King Westley was in it .
- Is that how you met him ?
- Yes .
We rode around all afternoon .
Father was frantic .
By 6 : 00, he was having all the rivers dragged .
Where 'd you learn to dunk , in finishing school ?
Now don 't you start telling me I shouldn 't dunk .
Of course you shouldn 't .
You don 't know how .
Dunking is an art .
Don 't let it soak so long .
A dip and sock , into your mouth .
You leave it in too long , it gets soft and falls off .
It 's all a matter of timing .
I 'll write a book about it .
Thanks , professor .
Just goes to show you . $ 20 million , and you don 't know how to dunk .
I 'd change places with a plumber 's daughter any day .
How do I know who you are ?
I never saw you before .
You can 't go around bothering my tenants .
There 's no girl by that name here .
How do I know you 're detectives ?
Show him your credentials , Mac .
Detectives .
That 's father at work .
Peter , what 'll I do ?
Maybe I can jump out of the window .
They won 't see me .
Get yourself all mussed up .
Get your hair down over your eyes and undo your buttons .
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week .
She said if we don 't stop over in Wilkes-Barre , she 'll never forgive us .
What are you talking about ?
The baby 's due next month .
They want us to come .
She saw your sister on the street the other day .
Said she 's looking swell .
Come in .
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy , don 't you ?
Grandma says it 's gonna be a girl .
She hasn 't missed calling one in years .
Man here to see you , sweetheart .
Who , me ?
You wanna see me ?
What 's your name ?
- Are you addressing me ?
- Yeah .
What 's your name ?
Wait a minute .
That 's my wife you 're talking to .
What do you mean coming here ?
What do you want ?
- We 're looking for somebody .
- Fine , but don 't come busting in here .
This isn 't a public park .
I got news to take a sock at you .
- Take it easy .
- The men are detectives .
Even if they 're the whole police department they can 't bust in here , questioning my wife .
Don 't get so excited .
He asked you a simple question .
Is that so ?
How many times have I told you not to butt in ?
You don 't have to lose your temper !
As usual .
Every time I try to protect you .
At the elks dance , when that big Swede hit on you .
He did not ! I told you a million times .
He kept pawing you all over the dance floor .
He didn 't .
You were drunk .
Nuts !
Just like your old man .
Once a plumber 's daughter , always a plumber 's daughter .
There ain 't an ounce of brains in your family .
Peter Warne , you 've gone far enough !
- Shut up !
- You see what you 've done ?
Sorry , but you see , we 've gotta check up on everybody .
We 're looking for a girl named Ellen Andrews .
Daughter of that big Wall Street mogul .
Too bad you 're not looking for a plumber 's daughter .
Quit bawling !
I told you they were a perfectly nice married couple .
You weren 't bad , jumping in like that .
- You 've got a brain .
- You 're not so bad , yourself .
We could start a two-people stock company .
Things get tough , we 'll play to small town auditoriums .
We 'll call this one , " The Great Deception . "
What about " Cinderella " or a real hot love story ?
No , too mushy .
I like mushy stuff .
Quit bawling !
Bus leaves in five minutes !
- What ?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes .
Holy smoke , we 're not even packed yet .
I 'm starting to think you couldn 't find your way home .
This is the last session ...
- Yeah ?
- Telegram for you .
- Bring it in .
- Another wire from Peter Warne .
Warne ?
Throw it in the wastebasket .
Wait a minute .
What does it say ?
" Have I got a story .
Stop .
It 's getting hotter and hotter .
Stop .
" Hope you 're the same . "
- Collect ?
- Yes .
- Lf you accept another one , you 're fired .
- Yes , sir .
And that gives me an idea for all of you .
I want action , Lovington , action .
- We can 't do the impossible .
- It isn 't impossible .
She 's somewhere between here and Miami .
I want her found .
- I put extra men on , the whole way .
- That 's not enough .
Send in Clark and Brown .
- You sure she isn 't with King Westley ?
- No .
He 's being trailed 24 hours a day .
He can 't even get a phone call we don 't know about .
I 'm worried .
After all , something might have happened to her .
I don 't think so .
Brown , arrange a radio broadcast .
Coast-to-coast hook up .
Offer a reward of $ 10,000 for information on her whereabouts .
Clark , send the story to all of the newspapers .
Some out-of-town papers may not have a picture of her .
Wire this to them .
I want the story to break right away .
Now we 'll get some action !
Fine , that 's fine .
You know that one about the man who flew on the trapeze ?
Yeah .
" Once I was happy but now I 'm forlorn
" Like an old coat that is tattered and torn
" Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn
" Betrayed by a maid in her teens
" This maid that I loved she was handsome
" And I tried all I knew how to please
" But I never could please her one-quarter so well
" As the man on the flying trapeze
" He flies through the air with the greatest of ease
" The daring young man on the flying trapeze
" His actions are graceful , all the girls he does please
" And my love he has stolen away "
I know the second verse there .
" Now he 'd play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
" His eyes would undress every girl in the house
" Perhaps he is better described as a louse And still people came just the same
" Now he smiles from the bar on the people below
" And one night he smiled on my love
" She blew him a kiss
" And she hollered bravo And he hung by his schnozzle from above
" He floats through the air with the greatest of ease
" Daring young man on the flying trapeze His actions are graceful
" All the girls he does please And my love he has stolen away "
Do you mind if I take the third one ?
" I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks
" While she spent her time with the circus ' freaks
" The tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
" Alas , Alack and Alaska
" I went to this fellow the villain , and I said
" I 'll see that you get your deserts
" His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer
" He sneered once again and said no
- Everybody keep your seats .
- Thank the man for me , Peter .
It 's the first comfortable position I 've been in all night .
What 's the matter with you ?
Somebody help .
Something happened to her .
Look how pale she is .
Let 's give her a chance to snap out of it .
Don 't worry .
She 'll be all right .
We ain 't ate nothing since yesterday .
What happened to your money ?
Ma spent it all on the tickets .
We didn 't know it was gonna be so much .
We shouldn 't have come , I guess .
But Ma said there was a job waiting for her in New York and if we didn 't go , she might lose it .
She 'll be all right when she 's had something to eat .
The next time we come to , you buy some food . Now come on .
I shouldn 't ought to take this .
Ma 'll get mad .
Don 't tell her .
You don 't want her to get sick again .
No , but you might need it .
Come on .
I got millions .
Here .
- Thanks .
- Come on , go back .
Better phone for some help .
Go phone if you want to .
The nearest town is 10 miles away .
Yeah ?
Say , buddy .
Like to take a look at my paper ?
Travelling like this , you lose track of what 's going on in the world .
Take that story there , for instance .
If I was to see that dame , you know what I 'd do ?
No .
I 'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Why ?
Because I don 't believe in hogging .
A bird that figures that way always ends up behind the eight ball .
That 's what I always say .
What 's on your mind ?
Five G 's or I crab the works .
Let 's get away from here and talk this over privately .
I knew she wasn 't your wife all the time .
Lucky thing , my running into you . Just the man I need .
- You made no mistake , believe me .
- I can use a smart guy like you .
- When you 're talking to old man Shapeley ...
- Can you make a gat ?
Huh ?
A gat .
A rod .
- Got any fireworks on you ?
- No .
I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase .
I 'll give you one of them .
May have trouble up north . Have to shoot it out with the cops .
If you manage , those five G 's are as good as in the bag .
I 'll talk to the Killer , he 'll take care of you .
Killer ?
Yeah .
The big boy . The boss of the outfit .
You 're not kidnapping her , are you ?
What else , stupid ?
You don 't think we 're after that penny-ante reward ?
$ 10 , 000 ?
Chicken feed .
Now listen , we 're holding that dame for a million smackers .
Say , I didn 't know it was anything like this .
You see , I 've got ...
What 's the matter ?
You getting yellow ?
I 'm a married man .
I got a couple of kids .
I can 't afford to get ...
Pipe down your mug before I ...
What are you trying to do , tell the whole world about it ?
Listen , you 're into this thing and you 're staying in , get me ?
You know too much .
I won 't say anything , honest I won 't .
How do I know that ?
I got a notion to plug you .
- Why should I take a chance with you ?
- Trust me , mister .
I 'll keep my mouth shut .
Yeah ?
What 's your name ?
Oscar Shapeley .
- Where do you live ?
- Orange , New Jersey .
Got a couple of kids ?
Yes , sir .
Just babies .
A little golden-haired girl .
- You love them , don 't you ?
- Yes , I do .
You wouldn 't .
You 're not thinking of ...
- You keep your trap shut , all right ?
- Sure .
- Lf you don 't ...
- I 'll keep my trap shut .
I will .
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley ?
Bugs Dooley ? No .
He was a nice guy , just like you .
And he made a big mistake one day .
Got a little too talkative .
- You know what happened to his kid ?
- No .
I can 't tell you .
But when Bugs heard about it he blew his brains out .
That 's terrible .
He had it coming to him .
He talked too much .
I never talk .
I never say a word .
Word of honour .
I wouldn 't want anything to happen to my kids .
Okay .
Just remember that .
Now beat it .
Sure , mister .
Thanks .
I always knew you guys were ...
Come on , scram .
And stay away from that bus .
Sure .
Anything you say .
- You wouldn 't shoot me in the back ?
- Lf you don 't beat it ...
I 'm going .
What 's wrong ?
Why do we have to leave the bus ?
Come on . Don 't ask so many questions .
Why ?
Poor old Shapeley .
You shouldn 't have frightened him like that .
At the rate he 's going , he 's probably crossed two state lines by this time .
Why did we have to leave the bus ?
When Shapeley stops running , he 's going to start thinking , isn 't he ?
I 've been doing a little thinking myself .
The next town we come to , you better wire your father .
What 's the matter , are you weakening ?
No .
I was just thinking of you .
A starvation diet may not agree with you .
Did you give that child all your money ?
I gave him nothing .
You were the big-hearted gal .
All the money I had was that ten spot .
So I 've been thinking you better wire your father .
No , sir .
I started out for New York and I 'm going to get there if I have to starve all the way .
Okay .
What is this strange power this man Westley has over you women ?
Here , take these .
- Hold on to them .
Get up on that log .
- That ?
Get up on the log .
I wish you 'd stop being playful .
So sorry .
You know , this is the first time in years I 've ridden piggyback .
This isn 't piggyback .
- Of course it is .
- You 're crazy .
I remember distinctly my father taking me for a piggyback ride .
- And he carried you like this ?
Your father didn 't know beans about piggyback riding .
My uncle has four children .
I 've seen them ride piggyback .
I 'll bet there isn 't a good piggyback rider in your family .
I never knew a rich man who could piggyback ride .
You 're prejudiced .
Show me a good piggy backer . I 'll show you a real human .
Take Abraham Lincoln for instance . A natural born piggy backer .
Where do you get off with that stuffed-shirt family of yours ?
My father was a great piggy backer .
Here , hold this a minute .
Thank you .
How long does this keep up ?
My feet are killing me .
This looks like the best spot .
We 're not going to sleep out here , are we ?
I don 't know about you , but I 'm going to give a good imitation of it .
What ?
I 'm awfully hungry .
It 's just your imagination .
No it isn 't .
I 'm hungry and scared .
You can 't be hungry and scared both at the same time .
Well , I am .
If you 're scared , it scares the hunger out of you .
Not if you 're more hungry than scared .
All right , you win .
Let 's forget about it .
I can 't forget it .
I 'm still hungry .
Holy smoke !
Why did I ever get mixed up with you ?
If I had any sense , I 'd be in New York by this time .
What about your story ?
Taking a married woman back to her husband .
I turned out to be the prize sucker .
All right , come on . Your bed 's all ready .
I 'll get my clothes all wrinkled .
- Then take them off .
- What ?
All right , don 't take them off .
Do what you please , but shut up about it .
You 're becoming awfully disagreeable lately .
You just snap my head off every time I open my mouth .
If being with me is so distasteful to you , you can leave .
You can leave any time you see fit .
Nobody 's holding you here .
I can get along .
- What 's the matter ?
- I was so scared !
What 's got into you ? I left for a minute to find you something to eat .
I know but ...
Here , eat your head off .
I don 't want it now .
- I thought you said you were hungry .
- I was , but ...
But what ?
I was so scared , it scared the hunger ...
Holy jumping catfish .
You drive a guy crazy .
It 's liable to get chilly before morning .
Better use this .
What are you thinking about ?
By a strange coincidence , I was thinking of you .
- Really ?
- Yeah .
I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy .
What did you say we 're supposed to be doing ?
Hitchhiking .
You 've given me a very good example of the hiking .
Where does the hitching come in ?
It 's a little early yet .
No cars out .
If it 's the same to you I 'm going to sit right here and wait until they come .
You got a toothpick ?
- What 's the matter ?
- I got hay in my teeth .
No , I haven 't got a toothpick .
Here , I got a penknife , though .
Now hold still .
- Be careful . - All right .
Where is it ?
All right , now hold still .
Here . Get it ?
Thanks .
You should have swallowed that .
You won 't have any breakfast , you know ?
You needn 't rub it in .
- What are you eating ?
- Carrots .
- Raw ?
- Want one ?
No .
Why didn 't you get me something I could eat ?
That 's right , I forgot .
The idea of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews .
You don 't think I 'm going around panhandling for you , do you ?
Have one of these .
Best thing for you , carrots .
I hate the horrid things .
I wish you wouldn 't talk so much .
Now we let a car get away .
And suppose nobody stops for us ?
They 'll stop all right .
It 's a matter of knowing how to handle them .
And you 're an expert I suppose .
Expert .
And I 'll write a book about it .
Call it " The Hitchhiker 's Hail . "
There 's no end to your accomplishments , is there ?
- You think it 's simple ?
- No .
Well , it is simple .
It 's all in that old thumb , see ?
Some people do it like this .
Or like this .
All wrong .
Never get anywhere .
The poor things .
But that old thumb never fails .
It 's all a matter of how you do it , though .
Now you take No. 1 , for instance .
That 's a short jerky movement , like this .
That shows independence .
You don 't care if they stop or not . You got money .
- Clever .
- No. 2 , that 's a little wider movement .
Smile goes with this one , like this .
That means you got a brand-new story about the farmer 's daughter .
You figured that out all by yourself ?
That 's nothing .
No. 3 , that 's a pip . That 's the pitiful one .
When you 're broke and hungry , everything looks black .
It 's a long sweeping movement like this . Gotta follow through , though .
That 's amazing .
But it 's no good , if you haven 't got a long face to go with it .
Here comes a car .
Okay . Now watch me .
I 'm gonna use No. 1 .
Keep your eye on that thumb , baby , and see what happens .
I still got my eye on the thumb .
Something must have gone wrong .
I 'll try No. 2 .
When you get to 100 , wake me up .
I don 't think I 'll write that book after all .
Think of all the fun you had , though .
You mind if I try ?
You ?
Don 't make me laugh .
You 're such a smart aleck .
Nobody knows anything but you .
I 'll stop a car and I won 't use my thumb .
What are you gonna do ?
It 's a system all my own .
Aren 't you going to give me a little credit ?
What for ?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb .
Why didn 't you take off all your clothes ?
You could have stopped 40 cars .
I 'll remember that when we need 40 cars .
So , you 're just married ? That 's pretty good .
But if I was young , that 's the way I 'd spend my honeymoon .
Hitchhiking .
Yes , sir . " Hitchhiking down the highway
" Of love on a honeymoon
Aren 't you afraid you 'll burn out a tonsil ?
Tonsil ? Me ?
No .
Me burn a tonsil ? " My tonsils won 't burn "
All right , let it go .
How about a bite to eat ?
- That would be lovely .
- No thanks , we 're not hungry .
Young people in love are never hungry .
No .
" Young people in love
" Are very seldom hungry
What were you going to do ?
Gold dig that guy for a meal ?
Sure , I was .
No fooling , I 'm hungry .
Eat a carrot .
No .
I 'm going in to ask him .
You do and I 'll break your neck .
Come on , let 's get out of here . Stretch our legs .
I 'm sorry ...
That 's all right .
Hey ! Come here !
You 've got my suitcase !
What happened to you ?
I was worried .
- Get in .
- Look at your face ! You 've got a cut !
Well , what happened ?
A road thief .
Picks people up , runs off with their things . What a racket .
How 'd you get the car ?
I gave him a black eye for it and had to tie him up to a tree .
Can 't be much gas left in this thing .
Gotta start promoting some .
Better take the things out of the pocket of that coat .
That 'll be good for ten gallons .
I haven 't changed my mind , Westley .
I want you to understand that .
I don 't like you . Never have .
Never will .
Now that 's clear enough , isn 't it ?
You 've made it evident by your threats of annulment .
It hasn 't worried me for a minute .
Ellie and I got married because we love each other .
She 's proving it .
As far as I 'm concerned , there 's going to be no annulment .
I see .
You 've got hold of a good thing and you 're going to hang on to it ?
All right , you win .
I 'll just have to get used to you .
I admit , I 'm licked .
But it 's only because I 'm worried .
If I don 't find her soon , I 'll go crazy .
I could have helped if it hadn 't been for you . I 've been watched so closely ...
I know .
Well , you can help now .
I 've got a room full of reporters in there .
Now , I want you to make a statement .
Say that we 've talked things over and come to an understanding .
And that if she returns I won 't interfere with your marriage .
- All right ?
- Yeah , that 's quite all right .
Okay .
I hope you and your wife spend a pleasant week with us .
So do I. Thank you .
Goodnight .
Goodnight .
- All right , brat .
- Any luck ?
Yeah .
He finally agreed to let us have a cabin .
What about the money ?
I talked him out of that idea .
He thinks we 're staying a week .
- I must think something up before morning .
- That 's swell .
Yeah ? I 'm glad you think so .
If you ask me , I think it 's foolish .
I told you there 's no use in staying here .
We can make New York in three hours .
I thought you were in a hurry to get back .
Whoever heard of getting in at 3 : 00 in the morning ?
Everybody will be asleep .
Okay . Cottage no . 6 .
There you go , trusting people again . How many times did I tell you ...
But he looked like a nice , upright young fellow , Ma .
We 're on the last lap .
Tomorrow morning , you 'll be in the arms of your husband .
Yeah .
You 'll have a great story , won 't you ?
Yeah . Swell .
Thanks .
We certainly outsmarted your father .
I guess you ought to be happy .
Am I going to see you in New York ?
Nope .
Why not ?
I don 't make it a policy to run around with married women .
There 's no harm in your coming to see us .
Not interested .
Won 't I ever see you again ?
What for ?
I 've served my purpose !
I brought you back to King Westley .
That 's what you wanted , wasn 't it ?
Have you ever been in love , Peter ?
Me ?
Yes .
Haven 't you ever thought about it at all ?
It seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy .
Sure , I 've thought about it .
Who hasn 't ?
If I could ever meet the right sort of girl .
Where are you gonna find her ?
Somebody that 's real . Somebody that 's alive .
They don 't come that way anymore .
Have I ever thought about it ?
I 've even been sucker enough to make plans .
I saw an island in the Pacific once .
Never been able to forget it .
That 's where I 'd like to take her .
She 'd have to be the sort of a girl who 'd jump in the surf with me and love it as much as I did .
Nights when you , the moon and the water all become one .
You feel you 're part of something big and marvellous .
That 's the only place to live .
The stars are so close overhead you feel you could reach up and stir them around .
I 've been thinking about it .
Boy , if I could ever find a girl who was hungry for those things .
Take me with you , Peter .
Take me to your island .
I want to do all those things you talked about .
You better go back to your bed .
I love you .
Nothing else matters .
But we can run away .
Everything will take care of itself .
Please , Peter I can 't let you out of my life now .
I couldn 't live without you .
You 'd better go back to your bed .
I 'm sorry .
Did you mean that ?
Would you really go ?
All I 'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York .
That bag 's worth $ 25 .
I got a bag .
I got one for Christmas ...
Here 's what I 'll do . I 'll come back in the morning and buy it back from you with a $ 10 profit .
- What do you say ?
- I ain 't got a hat .
- What ?
- I ain 't got a hat .
Well , you got one now .
Come on , fill her up .
Where you been all this time ?
Everybody 's been asking about you .
Get me one drink .
Nobody disturbs me for the next half hour .
Sure , boss .
- Don 't . He 'll shoot you on sight .
- Haven 't been shot at in days .
- Get out of here !
Get out ! - Now listen , Joe .
Don 't " Joe " me .
All right , Joe .
Listen .
You know I 've always liked you .
Anytime I could help you , ran across a good story I came running to you with it .
I got one now .
The wires were on the level .
The biggest scoop ever .
- It 's yours .
- About the Andrews kid ?
I 've got it all written up , ready to go .
All I want is a $ 1,000 .
A $ 1,000 ?
Get out of here before ...
Don 't get sore .
You gotta do this for me .
I need a $ 1,000 and I need it quick .
I 'm in a jam .
What 's the $ 1,000 for ?
To tear down the walls of Jericho .
Never mind .
If I told you that Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage ?
- She 'll marry somebody else .
- You 're drunk .
Would such a story be worth $ 1,000 to you ?
- Lf it was on the level .
- I got it , Joe .
- Who 's the guy she 's gonna marry ?
- I am .
- You ?
- Yes .
Now I know you 're drunk .
I 'm going home .
Don 't annoy me anymore .
For heaven sakes !
Stop being an editor for a minute .
We know each other .
You ought to know when I 'm serious .
This is on the level .
I met her on a bus from Miami .
I 've been with her every minute .
I 'm in love with her .
You gotta get me this money now , quick .
Minutes count .
She 's waiting for me outside Philadelphia .
I gotta get right back .
She doesn 't even know I 'm gone .
A guy can 't propose to a gal without a cent in the world , can he ?
What a story .
On her way to join husband , Ellen Andrews ...
That 's it .
Let me see that a minute .
Zeke !
I told you , you couldn 't trust him .
He 's gone .
Who ?
The fella who was gonna stay a week .
He skipped and took the car with him , too .
We wouldn 't have known till morning if I hadn 't took that magnesia .
Get up , don 't lay there . Let 's do something about it .
There ain 't nothing we can do if he 's gone .
See that ?
They 're gone .
Looks like it , don 't it ?
What 's this ?
Ma ! Here 's the woman .
- What 's the matter ?
- Where 's your husband ?
- Husband ?
- Yes , if he is your husband .
- Isn 't he here ?
- No , he ain 't .
The car 's gone , too .
You got any money ?
- No .
- Then you 'll have to git !
Yeah .
You 'll have to git .
Please , may I use your phone ?
I 've got to call New York .
You ain 't gonna stick me for no phone call .
Go to the sheriff 's office , a quarter mile down the road .
They 'll fix you up .
And listen , next time you better not come back here .
I run a respectable place .
- Thanks , you saved my life .
- Okay . So long kid and good luck .
Goodbye .
You 're beautiful .
All women are beautiful .
For my dough , he 's still the best newspaper man in the business .
Get Hank , quick .
Boy , what a yarn .
Hold up the morning edition .
Break down the front page .
We 'll have a new layout .
Send in a couple of rewrite men .
And Hank , listen .
Don 't do a thing .
I 've got a story that 'll make your hair curl . Wait a minute .
Don 't annoy me , I 'm busy .
Agnes , send Mike in here !
Dig up all the pictures on that Andrews kid .
And Hank , listen , get Haley out of bed .
I want a cartoon and I want it quick .
Westley 's in it .
He 's waiting at the church with tears on his face .
The bride didn 't show up .
Old Man Andrews is laughing his head off .
Everything exaggerated .
Snap into it .
What is it ?
Ellen Andrews ?
You 're crazy .
I 'm not .
She phoned her father from an auto camp asking him to come .
He 's getting a police escort and Westley 's going along .
Yes , she 's been travelling by bus .
When she found out her father and Westley made up , she phoned .
Okay , grab a car and stay with them .
Get Hank again .
Agnes , get me a doctor , I 'm gonna have a nervous breakdown .
Hank , forget what I told you .
I 'm having a nightmare .
Agnes , you call the police department .
Tell them to find Peter Warne .
Send out a general alarm .
I want that dirty crook pinched .
You want us ?
Change the front page !
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father .
She 's going home .
She found out Dad withdrew his objections .
She gave herself up .
Spread it all over the place !
Play it up big ! Major league ! " Love Triumphant . " Go on , hop to it .
Okay .
Come on , baby .
We gotta get there before she wakes up .
Can 't you drive any faster ?
" Young people in love are never hungry "
Come on , baby .
We 've got a police escort .
Come on , baby .
They can 't make a sucker out of us .
All right , come on .
Step back . Give them room .
Come on , step back .
How about a picture for the paper , Mr. Andrews ?
Wait till she gets home .
Later , boys . Later .
Get that thing out of the way !
Keep your britches on , we 'll get it out .
Hey , you darn fool !
Ellen Andrews is going to marry that Westley guy again .
Gordon 's out back some place .
When he comes in , give him this .
Tell him I was just kidding .
- You can 't get a thing done around here .
- Peter was just in .
- What ?
- He left this money .
- He said he was just kidding .
- Where is he ?
- There he goes .
- Hey , Pete !
Hello .
I 'm sorry , it was just a little gag . I thought I 'd have some fun with you .
Yeah , sure you had me going for a little while , too .
- It wouldn 't have made a bad story at that .
- No , great .
But that 's the way things go .
Yeah . Where am I ?
When you sober up , come in and talk to me .
Thanks .
Ellie ?
Hello , Dad .
I knocked several times .
I 'm sorry .
I must have been daydreaming .
Everything 's set .
Creating quite a furore , too .
Great stunt King is going to pull .
Stunt ?
Yeah , he 's landing on the lawn in an autogyro .
Yes , I heard .
Personally , I think it 's silly , too .
You look lovely , child .
Are you pleased with the gown ?
Ellie ?
The gown .
Yes , it 's nice , isn 't it ?
What 's the matter , child ?
What 's wrong ?
Nothing .
You haven 't changed your mind about King have you ?
No .
Because if you have , it isn 't too late .
You know how I feel about him .
Well , you gave me such a scare when I couldn 't find you .
You know , the old pump isn 't what it used to be .
I 'm sorry , Father .
I wouldn 't hurt you for anything in the world . You know that .
What 's the matter , child ?
Aren 't you happy ?
I thought so .
I knew there was something on your mind .
There , now .
What 's the matter ?
You haven 't fallen in love with someone else , have you ?
Have you ?
I haven 't seen you cry since you were a baby .
This must be serious .
Where 'd you meet him ?
On the road .
Now don 't tell me you 've fallen in love with a bus driver ?
Oh , no .
Who is he ?
I don 't know very much about him .
Except that I love him .
If it 's as serious as all that , we 'll move heaven and earth to ...
No , it 's no use .
He despises me .
Come now .
Yes , he does . He despises everything about me .
He says that I 'm spoiled and selfish and pampered and thoroughly insincere .
Ridiculous .
He doesn 't think so much of you , either .
Well , I ...
And he blames you for everything that 's wrong with me .
He says you raised me stupidly .
And now that 's a fine man to fall in love with .
He 's marvellous .
What are we going to do about it ?
Where is he ?
- I don 't know .
- I 'd like to have a talk with him .
It wouldn 't do any good .
I practically threw myself at him .
Under the circumstances , don 't you think we 'd better call this thing off ?
No , I 'll go through with it .
But that 's silly .
Seeing the way you feel about him .
No , it doesn 't matter . I don 't want to stir up any more trouble .
I 've done it all my life .
I 've made your life miserable .
And mine , too .
I 'm tired , father . I 'm tired of running around in circles .
He 's right , that 's what I 've been doing ever since I can remember .
I 've got to settle down .
It doesn 't matter how , where , or with whom .
You 've changed , Ellie .
I can 't walk out on King now .
It would make us all look so ridiculous .
Anyway , what difference does it make ?
I 'll never see Peter again .
Is that his name ?
Peter Warne .
Why , do you know him ?
Why , no .
Father , you haven 't heard from him , have you ?
- Don 't be silly , of course .
- Please , what 's that ?
I guess that was his only interest in me , wasn 't it ?
- The reward .
- I 'm sorry you read it .
- Are you going to see him ?
- I suppose so .
Certainly .
Pay him off . He 's entitled to it .
He did an excellent job .
He kept me thoroughly entertained .
It 's worth every penny he gets .
Thank you , Mary .
That 's just what I needed .
Mr. Westley 's on his way up .
Fine , have him come in .
I 'll be going .
If it isn 't the bridegroom himself .
You 're just in time , King .
How are you , Ellie ?
You happy ?
Happy ? Why shouldn 't I be happy ?
Here we are , let 's drink .
It 's up to you now . I want our life to be full of excitement .
We 'll never let up , will we ? Never a dull moment .
We 'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off .
- Promise you 'll never let me get off .
- Whatever you say , darling . It 's a promise .
Yeah .
Who ?
Why can 't I see you at your office ?
I 'm leaving for Washington tonight .
I may be gone several weeks .
I thought , perhaps , you 'd like to get this thing settled .
Yeah .
But I don 't like the idea of butting in on your jamboree .
Between you and me , those things give me a stiff pain .
You don 't have to see anybody .
You can come directly to my study .
No .
Why do I wanna ...
Hey , wait a minute .
Maybe I will come over . Yeah .
I 'd like to get a load of that three ring circus you 're pulling .
I wanna see what love looks like when it 's triumphant .
I haven 't had a good laugh in a week .
Mr. Warne ?
Yeah .
- Sit down .
- Thanks .
I was surprised to get your note .
My daughter hadn 't told me anything about you .
About your helping her .
That 's typical of your daughter .
Takes those things for granted .
Why did she think I lugged her from Miami ?
She thinks you 're entitled to anything you can get .
She does ?
Isn 't that sweet of her ?
You don 't , I suppose .
Well , I don 't know .
I 'll have to see on what you base your claim .
I presume you feel justified .
If I didn 't , I wouldn 't be here .
I got it all itemised .
" Cash outlay , $ 8.60 .
Top coat , $ 15 .
" Suitcase , $ 7.50 .
Hat , $ 4 .
" Three shirts , $ 4.50 .
Total , $ 39.60 .
" All of the above items had to be sold to buy gasoline . "
And I sold some shorts and socks , too .
I 'm throwing those in .
- Yes , I know .
- What 's the matter ?
Isn 't it cheap enough ?
Trip like that 'd cost you a $ 1,000, maybe more .
Now , let me get this straight . You want $ 39.60 in addition to the $ 10,000 ?
What 10,000 ?
The reward .
Who said anything about a reward ?
I 'm afraid I 'm a little bit confused .
I assumed ...
All I want is $ 39.60 .
If you give me a check for it , I 'll get out of this joint .
It gives me the jitters .
- You 're a peculiar chap .
- We 'll go into that some other time .
The average man would go after the reward .
Did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ?
It 's a matter of principle .
You probably wouldn 't understand .
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride , I don 't like paying for the privilege .
Were you taken for a buggy ride ?
Yes . With all the trimmings .
So how about the check , do I get it ?
- Certainly .
- Thanks .
Here you are .
Thank you .
Do you mind if I ask you a question , frankly ?
Do you love my daughter ?
Any guy in love with your daughter should be examined .
Now that 's an evasion .
She picked herself a perfect running mate , King Westley .
The pill of the century .
She needs a guy that 'd sock her once a day whether it 's coming to her or not .
If you were wiser , you 'd have done it yourself long ago .
Do you love her ?
A normal man couldn 't live with her without going nutty .
She 's my idea of nothing .
I asked you a simple question !
Do you love her ?
Yes !
Now don 't hold that against me !
I 'm a little screwy myself !
Here 's to the merry-go-round .
Perfect . Now you look natural .
- I hope you got your money .
- You bet I did .
- Congratulations .
- Thanks . Same to you .
Stay around and watch the fun .
You 'll enjoy it immensely .
I would , but I 've got a weak stomach .
- I just had a long talk with him .
- I 'm not interested .
Now just a minute , Ellie .
I don 't want to hear another word about him .
Come on , folks .
King Westley has arrived .
Here they come , boys .
Turn them over .
You 're a sucker to go through with this .
That guy , Warne , is okay .
He didn 't want the reward .
All he asked for was $ 39.60 .
It 's what he spent on you .
Said it was a matter of principle .
You took him for a ride .
He loves you , Ellie .
He told me so .
You don 't want to be married to a mug like Westley .
I can buy him off for a pot of gold .
And you can make an old man happy .
And you won 't do so bad for yourself .
If you change your mind , your car 's waiting at the back gate .
Dearly beloved , we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company , to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony .
If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together , let him now speak or else , hereafter forever , hold his peace .
King , will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife so long as you both shall live ?
I will .
Ellen , will thou have this man to thy wedded husband so long as you both shall live ?
What happened ?
I haven 't the slightest idea .
Don 't want to talk to you .
Don 't want to talk to anybody .
Don 't want to see anybody .
But it 's King Westley on the phone .
Hello , my would be ex-son-in-law .
I 've sent you a check for $ 100,000 .
That 's the smartest thing you ever did , Westley , not to contest that annulment .
That 's satisfactory , isn 't it ? It ought to be .
I 'm not complaining .
Not complaining . It was dirt-cheap .
Don 't fall out of any windows !
There 's another wire from Peter .
They 're in Glen Falls , Michigan .
" What 's holding up the annulment , you slowpoke .
" The walls of Jericho are toppling . "
Send him a telegram right away . Just say , " Let them topple . "
- Funny couple , ain 't they ?
- Yeah .
If you ask me , I don 't believe they 're married .
They 're married , all right .
I just seen the license .
They made me get them a rope and a blanket , on a night like this .
What do you reckon that 's for ?
Blamed if I know .
I just brought them a trumpet .
A trumpet ?
A toy .
They sent me to the store to get it .
What in the world do they want a trumpet for ?
Don 't know .
How often do I have to tell you ... that Sophia Frederica is no longer to play with toys .
She 's almost seven now .
Don 't smoke in here .
The child is sick .
I work day and night to arrange an advantageous marriage someday , and you undo everything .
How am I to make it clear to you that Sophia might one day become a queen ?
I don 't want to be a queen , Mother . I want to be a toe dancer .
Be quiet , Sophia .
You 're going to marry a king if I have anything to do with it .
Stick out your tongue , Your Highness , and say " ahh . "
Not as bad as I thought .
We 'll build her a nice harness , and she 'll have to wear it for about a year .
Put those toys away .
I don 't want to see them again !
You 'll grow up to be a tall and beautiful woman .
I must be off on one of my operations .
Don 't let them frighten you , darling .
" A nice harness " !
What is he , a horse doctor ?
You flatter him .
Our learned medico is going to perform one of his operations with an axe .
- He 's the public hangman .
- Hangman ?
What 's a hangman ?
Can I become a hangman someday ?
A hangman is an executioner , the man who takes heads off skillfully .
Sometimes that profession becomes the sport of titles .
I was about to read to you ... of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible , and other Russian tsars and tsarinas who were hangmen .
Stop walking , August .
You make me nervous .
Your Highness !
Your Highness !
Your Highness !
Your Highness , a letter from the king .
Your father wishes to see you at once .
Sit down , my child .
We have been honored with a communication from His Majesty ... which concerns you principally .
" We , by Divine Grace Frederick , king of Prussia , " have , after a series of negotiations , " decided to honor your family by selecting your daughter ,
" Sophia Frederica to forthwith set out for Russia ... " and there to become the bride of His Serene Highness , Peter Feodorovich ,
" grandson of Peter the Great , nephew of Her Imperial Majesty , " and heir presumptive to the throne .
" Within the week , an emissary will arrive ... " to escort your daughter and her mother ,
" Princess Johanna Elizabeth , to the court at Moscow .
" Please inform her that she is to follow dutifully ... " the advice of Her Majesty 's ambassador ... " and extend to her , as well as to your entire family , my fond greetings and affections .
Fredericus Rex . "
Grand duchess of Russia !
Not bad for this family .
I wonder what he looks like . That unimportant detail can be settled when the ambassador gets here .
Come , August , we shall reply to the king at once .
One must strike while the iron 's hot .
This is the countess Cecilia , a cousin on my mother 's side .
and this is her sister , Maria , and this ...
Your Highness may now come down .
This is Count Alexei , field marshal of the Russian Army , grand master of the hunt , lord of the chamber and ambassador extraordinary ... from Her Divine Majesty , Elizabeth of Russia .
Although for a long time we 've heard about your beauty , Your Highness , I must confess , I was not prepared to see such a vision of loveliness .
Her Majesty instructed me to present a few gifts as evidence of her graciousness .
Come here .
This pipe is for you , Prince August .
These sables are to keep your shoulders warm . These gloves are to keep your hands warm .
This robe is to keep your feet warm .
These hot-water bottles , to keep Mother warm .
Is it then still so cold in Russia , Your Excellency ?
Indeed , Your Highness , the rivers are still frozen , and will be until some time after we 've arrived .
Her Majesty also asked me to give you this token of her esteem .
Convey to her my profoundest thanks .
Isn 't Her Majesty beautiful !
How long will the journey take ?
If weather permits , we should reach Moscow in seven weeks , where Her Majesty is impatiently awaiting us .
- And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun ?
- The day after tomorrow , unless it is the desire of this charming young lady ... to leave at once to meet her anxious bridegroom .
- Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke ?
- I 'm sorry , I did not . - Would you like him to be handsome ?
- Isn 't he ?
Would you like him to be better looking than all men , tall and gracious ?
- Yes , I think I would . - Well , he is all that and more .
He 's the handsomest man in the Russian court , tall and formed like a Greek god , a model in fashion and deportment which all of us strive to follow .
- Are you eager to see him ?
- Yes . His eyes are like the blue sky , his hair the color of ebony .
He is stronger than a team of oxen , and sleepless because of his desire to receive you in his arms .
And he can also read and write .
So can my daughter .
She can cook and sew and make her own bed if she has to .
- Can 't you , Sophia ?
- But I don 't like to make my own bed , Mother .
- Don 't speak unless you 're questioned .
- You did question me , Mother .
Say good night , and go back to your room and go to sleep .
Good night , Father .
Good night , Sophia .
Good night , Your Excellency .
Good night , my little princess . - Good night , Mother .
- Good night .
- Good night , Auntie .
- Good night .
This is unexpected .
Your daughter is extremely charming ... and will be by far the most beautiful woman at Her Majesty 's court .
I 'd be grateful if you were not to turn her head .
She 's been brought up carefully , is unspoilt , and I 've taught her not to flirt .
You 're going on a far journey , and I may never see you again .
Remember what I 've taught you .
Always to be honest and truthful ; to be a faithful wife and a loyal subject of your new country .
Be kind to those who are in your service ... and obedient to your husband and superiors , and strive at all times to be worthy of your glorious destiny .
Another day like this , and I 'll fall apart .
When I return , I 'll complain to the king about the state of his roads .
The roads are bad , aren 't they ? When we reach the border , there will be snow and we shall change to sleds .
Your rooms are ready , Your Royal Highness .
Can I show them to you ? Yes , you may .
Is the journey proving too much for you too ?
It could go on forever ... if Mother didn 't mind . Oh , no .
Be careful with that knife .
You 'll cut your beautiful hand .
- Why did you do that ?
- Because I 've fallen in love with you .
Now you may punish me for my effrontery . I deserve punishment far more than you do .
We must never do this again .
It 's disloyal to my future husband .
Disloyal ? It 's treason , and I must be careful in the future , but you must help me by not exciting me with your beautiful eyes .
I told you not to look at me .
What are you two doing ? Don 't answer me .
I don 't want to know .
Sophia , you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Incidentally , our rooms are beneath all contempt , Your Excellency .
The stables are probably better than the quarters assigned to us .
I 'm sorry , Your Highness . If you prefer the stables , I can arrange to have the horses quartered in your bedroom .
Barbarian !
You 're going to sleep in my room tonight .
It is cold .
A basket of fruit with Her Majesty 's compliments , and these flowers from the grand duke , who instructed me to ride day and night for a week to be here in time .
Welcome home , Your Excellency .
So , this is Little Sophie , Sophia Frederica .
Hardly a name for a future empress .
- You don 't like your name , do you ?
- I do , Your Majesty .
You will be called Catherine Alexina , a good Russian name .
We 've arranged a special ceremony to receive you into our church .
- Haven 't we , Simeon ? - Yes , little mother , we 've arranged a ceremony .
Come here .
So , this is the mother .
You 've raised a pretty child . Your Majesty , I 've come to lay at your feet feelings of the deepest gratitude ... for the benefactions which your bounty has heaped upon my house , and of which many instances are given me at every step I take into your realms .
Tush , tush !
A pretty speech .
What I have done is nothing in comparison with what I shall do .
- My own blood is no more dear to me than yours .
This is the order of St. Catherine .
May you both wear it in good health .
Be careful it doesn 't scratch you .
Pin this on Catherine .
What do you think of Catherine ?
I can only admire your judgment , Your Majesty .
That 's the chancellor . Steals more money in a week than I collect in taxes in a year .
Doctor , come here .
What do you think of my taste in women ?
Looks healthy , doesn 't she ?
Just what we need to breed sons for Russia .
- How was the journey ?
Comfortable ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Are you happy to be here ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
- Are you going to love your new country ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Do you promise to be a loyal subject ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Don 't make too many new friends , and no intrigue and gossip .
Perfect , Your Majesty .
She will give us no trouble .
Your Highness .
Someday I 'll have every doctor thrown out of the country .
Catherine , before you go to your rooms , is there any wish I can grant you ?
His Imperial Highness , Grand Duke Peter .
That 's a fine way to receive your bride !
I suppose you had more important things to do .
I told you to be on time .
Remember , Catherine , the first child must be a boy .
That 's why we had you brought here , to provide Russia with an heir to the throne .
A fine , bouncing , healthy heir .
These are your ladies-in-waiting .
They represent illustrious houses of our most important domains .
Step forward , Natacha .
She is the daughter of Prince Dolgoruki .
Natacha , come here .
This is your mistress of the wardrobe .
I must show her my new invention .
I 'm in a hurry .
I suggest that you wait in the next room .
Perhaps I shouldn 't have lied to you .
His Imperial Highness sent me for his soldiers .
She 's always picking up the grand duke 's soldiers , which I 'm beginning to suspect he leaves intentionally .
Don 't bother .
Go on with your work .
Doesn 't Sophia , I mean , Catherine , look beautiful ?
I always forget the new name .
Just see what 's being done to her hair !
That 's exactly what I 'm looking at .
How 's she going to wear the headdress ?
Where is the headdress ?
We must make you very beautiful , Catherine , very , very beautiful ... so that my nephew will fall in love with you .
I expect you two to behave like love birds so Russia will have an heir to the throne . Remember , I want a boy , not a girl .
Nothing less than a boy will do .
We don 't want any more women on the throne .
But Your Majesty , what would we have done if you had been born a boy ?
I would have had less trouble in Russia if I 'd been born a man instead of woman .
We women are too much creatures of the heart , aren 't we , Catherine ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
" Grant them of the fruit of their bodies fair children ,
" concord of soul and body . " exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon . " like a luxuriant vine , give them seed in number like full ears of grain ...
" that they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee ; " and let them behold their children 's children like a newly planted olive orchard ,
" round about their table that obtaining favor in Thy sight , they may shine like the stars of heaven . "
Your Imperial Majesty , before the bridal pair retire , I wish to propose a toast ... to Her Imperial Highness , the grand duchess Catherine .
May our new bride from far away be forever happy ... and learn to know the love we have in our Russian hearts for her ... and the hope this vast , imperishable empire has ... for an heir to the throne .
You have made me very happy today , Catherine , and i hope you will continue to make me happy .
Now , I 'm going to bed . I 'm very tired . And I know that most of you ... are ... are also very tired .
May I inquire how Her Imperial Highness deigns to feel this morning ?
Her Highness feels as well as can be expected ... after her romantic marriage .
And how is His Excellency ?
- I haven 't been avoiding you . - You have .
I 've tried again and again to see you alone ... - and you 've made it impossible . - If you must know ,
I haven 't had enough time to recover from the shock ... of finding my husband a trifle different than you described him .
I had a duty to my country and a loyalty to my sovereign .
Had I described the grand duke correctly , you might not have come here .
I would have obeyed my mother even if you had told the truth .
How could I have known of such a degree of filial respect ?
Anyway , I would have taken no chances , because from the moment I saw you ,
- I wanted you to come to Russia . - Please , be careful .
- My husband will be told .
- Your husband doesn 't mean a thing to you .
He does .
I 'll always be faithful to him .
Those ideas are old-fashioned .
But I 'm not a Russian . I 'm going now .
I told you I wanted to see you alone .
I won 't wait any longer .
I 'll be at the stables tomorrow when you go for your ride .
Maybe I won 't care to ride anymore .
- I 'll be there , and you 'd better be there too .
Furthermore , I 'm going to tell my mother all about you .
One moment more , Your Imperial Highness .
On the reverse side of this miniature is a diamond .
What are you doing here sneaking around like a ghost ?
- I hate my wife .
- You hate your wife ?
You 've only been married for a week . Why ?
You 'll make a fine emperor someday , you idiot !
You can 't force a woman to be sweet to you .
She 's only a child ! Be patient with her .
You know our people are waiting for you to raise a family .
- They don 't care whether you like her .
- I don 't want her .
I picked her for your wife , and your wife she will remain as long as I live .
Her Majesty is waiting for you in the council chamber .
- War with Finland ? - The last few days she 's turned sour , like milk that 's been standing too long . - Yes , Your Excellency .
Your Highness is so happy this morning .
- You can 't be going to see your husband .
I 'd forgotten I have a husband . No , I 'm not going to see my husband .
If Your Highness were not so new to our court , I 'd suspect you were going to see your lover .
Lover ? And what may a lover be ?
A lover 's a man , not a husband , who loves you with all his heart and whom you love in return .
But , Marie , that 's wicked .
Don 't tell me that you have a lover !
I wish I had . Here , everyone has a lover , everyone but me .
Oh , Marie , not everyone .
Her Exalted Majesty can 't possibly have a lover .
What about the young man who 's always with her ?
Why do you suppose she leans on him so heavily ?
Because she 's weak in the knees ? Oh , how shocking !
If anyone should hear us ! Go on , get my dress .
Your highness won 't tell anyone . The empress is a devil when she 's angry .
Of course I won 't tell anyone , nor do I believe such nonsense .
Neither have I a lover .
I 'm happy because I 'm going to see my mother .
- Your mother ?
I thought you knew . - Knew what ?
Your mother left for Germany .
Her carriage set out at midnight .
- You must be joking . - I 'm not joking .
Her Majesty ordered her to return immediately .
Her Majesty 's in council .
Why did you send my mother away ?
What wrong had she done ?
I don 't remember sending for you .
I want to know why you sent my mother away . You presume to question me ?
Who do you think you are , bursting into a conference as though the palace were on fire ?
You want to know why I sent your mother away .
Well , I 'll tell you why .
I sent your mother away because she didn 't bring you up properly .
I was told you were an obedient , respectful child .
You 're nothing of the sort ! Why do you think I had you brought from Germany ?
To give you these pearls ? Or to make you a grand duchess of the Holy Russian Empire ?
I had you brought here to be an obedient wife ... and to supply my country with a much-needed heir to the throne . Take Her Imperial Highness , the grand duchess , and turn her over to my mistress of the robes ... with instructions that from this minute on she 's to be attached to my personal staff ... where I can keep her under my eye , where I can educate her and teach her ... what it means to be a Russian wife and how to accept the embraces of a husband ... like a Russian wife !
Looking for someone ?
Oh , you frightened me .
I 've only a minute .
I ran away .
I came down to tell you not to wait . I must go now .
It will be easier for you to scream without a straw in your mouth .
You asked me to arrange a dinner for the French and Austrian ambassadors and their wives .
Tell them to come for breakfast .
I never did like these diplomatic functions . - They lead to nothing .
- I quite agree , Your Majesty .
Boris , sit down there . Alexander , sit over there .
You , sit there .
Michael !
- Your Majesty . - Catherine .
Take his toys .
Michael , sit there .
Paul ! - Your Majesty .
- Oh , go on . Sit down .
Now , the rest of you get out .
Get out ! Get out !
The way you handle that pig , you 'd think it was the only one in Russia . - The wine , Your Majesty .
- Fill the glasses and get out .
What are you pouting for ?
You 're not jealous of Paul , are you ?
He isn 't jealous of you .
You look exhausted , Paul .
What 's the matter ? I 'm tired .
My wife gave birth to a child yesterday .
- Boy or girl ?
- A boy , beloved empress .
What the wife of a guard can do should certainly be easy for a grand duchess .
Remind me to give you a purse of gold tomorrow . Those of you who have boys , raise your hands .
Exactly what I thought !
A few more like you , and Russia need never worry about her enemies .
What 's this , Alexei ? Sending notes to the grand duchess ?
Or shall I tell the grand duchess that you 're a notorious heartbreaker ... and have broken every woman 's heart in this court , including mine ?
You 're very flattering , Imperial Majesty , but the note contains nothing of importance .
Then suppose you read it .
" We are all very much disturbed over your conduct ... and wish you would change your behavior so that Her Majesty might forgive you . "
Who else can read here ? You read it , Catherine .
I know you can read ... because my reports say you foolishly spend your time in bed reading books !
" at ... and hope ... you will behave better ... so that you may be forgiven by the empress . " Send for the chancellor !
" You must help me to see you alone again .
" You are being watched so closely that all my efforts to meet you ... for a few precious seconds are in vain . "
So , you 're up to your old tricks again ! Right under my nose too . Well , forget about her .
she 's reserved for my nephew and being taught how to earn his love first ... before wasting her favors on others .
Go back to your dinner .
It 's the first time you 've been of use to me in a year . As for you , look after my friends and see that they 're fed well .
Did you hear what I said ?
She may be a grand duchess to the rest of the world , but in here she 's being taught how to be a Russian wife !
Go outside and send the others away .
I want to be alone tonight .
I haven 't even the power to iron out a single wrinkle .
What are you looking at ?
Go see if it is , and tell him to come here at once .
I wanted to watch my wife .
Watching your wife won 't give you an heir to the throne . The next time I catch you providing my rooms with needless ventilation ,
I 'll have you flogged .
I 'll catch my death of a draft someday ! Go back to your rooms and wait for your wife .
Sorry to intrude , Your Majesty .
I think the grand duke dropped one of his soldiers in here . Thank you .
Good night . Wait a minute .
Come here .
Two years and a half , Your Majesty . I fail to recall your exact duties here , Countess Elizabeth .
I 'm in charge of entertainment for His Imperial Highness , the grand duke .
Exactly how far is it to your home , Lizzie ?
My ancestral home is in the province of Astrakhan , about two weeks ' journey from Moscow .
Not as far as I had hoped . His Imperial Highness has been entertained long enough .
Do you understand me ?
I don 't want to see you around again . Get out .
I should have thrown her out before I had you brought here .
Are you going to behave like an obedient wife ... or must I continue to treat you like a stubborn child ?
I don 't care what you do with me . You might change your mind about that .
You 're in love with His Excellency , Count Alexei , aren 't you ?
No , Your Majesty , I 'm not . I 'm not .
It 's a good thing you 're not .
I wouldn 't advise you to become my rival .
Rival ? What does Your Majesty mean ?
You will find out soon .
In the meantime , you can blow out the candles .
Behind my mirror , a concealed passage will lead you down ... a flight of stairs to another door .
I don 't want him to see you , so be careful .
And you don 't need to report for duty until late tomorrow .
- Just a minute , my little hen .
That 's not the password .
You 'd better think up another one .
Come to the guardhouse , and we 'll find out who you are . You 're entirely too good-looking to be running around like this .
What are you hiding back there ?
Take your hands off me , you insolent fool ! I 'm Catherine , grand duchess of Russia .
Don 't take advantage of me .
This is my first night on duty .
The grand duchess isn 't permitted out at night .
Tell me who you are .
I told you who I am . Oh , come now .
Stop joking .
If you 're the grand duchess , then I 'm the grand duke .
I wish you were ! if i were the grand duke and you were the grand duchess ,
I wouldn 't let you prowl through the night like this , like a pretty little kitten .
On a night like this , anything might happen ... if I 'm fortunate .
Well , Lieutenant , you are fortunate , very ... fortunate .
Three volleys . It 's a boy !
Have you noticed , Your Majesty , how the imperial duckling resembles his father ? Hush , hush , enough of this .
Now , you keep an eye on him .
I don 't want anyone near him unless I know about it , not even his mother .
I had enough trouble getting him .
If he catches cold or sniffles just once ,
I 'll have you hung by the ears ! If he coughs , I 'll have you cut in half ! And if anyone touches him , I 'll have you shot !
Your Majesty , I beg of you not to become excited .
You 've been ill for weeks . This turmoil will weaken you .
Don 't any of you think I 'll give you the pleasure of seeing me die !
I 'll outlive all of you , you sinister buzzards . All of you !
- We 've been glad with rejoicing .
- Your Imperial Highness !
I suppose you , too , want to congratulate me ... as the father of the heir to the throne of Russia .
That was my intention , Your Imperial Highness .
And I bring you the felicitations of my nation ... and my own personal congratulations on so glorious an event .
I want to be alone , do you hear ? Get out , all of you !
I 'm crammed up to my neck with congratulations !
Get out !
And if you must congratulate someone , congratulate my wife !
Shh .
The empress joins her people in congratulating Your Highness ... on the birth of a male heir to the throne of Russia .
We all hope you will recover quickly ... so you may wear this jewel , which Her Majesty is pleased to present to you as a sign ... of her most extraordinary joy and satisfaction .
Your Excellency , what can I do for you ?
Will you please ask Her Highness once more ... - if she will grant me an audience ?
- I 'm sorry , Your Excellency , we have orders from Her Highness not even to mention your name to her .
Then perhaps you will convey to Her Highness ... that I 've been waiting for some time now to congratulate her ... on the great historic event of providing our country with a much-needed heir to the throne .
I 'm certain that history was far from her mind at the time , Your Excellency .
Her Majesty is very ill , and her days are numbered .
Soon she will be no more , poor soul , and another maniac will become our emperor .
It will be a bad day for Russia , and for me if I live that long . Why are you telling this to me ?
You know that the grand duke isn 't exactly pleased with the present state of affairs .
State of affairs ? What affairs ?
I haven 't had an affair for some time .
I know that the grand duke plans to remove you from court ... or worse , as soon as he is in power .
Now that I 've learned how Russia expects me to behave ,
I like it here . And I intend to stay ... grand duke or no grand duke !
We all hope you will stay , and I for one , at the risk of my neck , would like to help you .
How could you be of help ?
I control enough of the political machine to carry some weight in a crisis .
I have no wish to share in any petty conspiracy .
Should it become unavoidable , I think I have weapons ... that are far more powerful than any political machine .
I 'm afraid you don 't know Russians , my child . That 's possible , father , But I 'm taking lessons as fast as I can .
Right here , gentlemen .
What a lovely target .
You 're looking quite well , Catherine , since you provided me with an unexpected addition to the family . Thank you , Peter .
It 's nice to see you again .
Come to think of it , I 'd like you to meet someone ... who 's come for an extended visit .
Back to the barracks !
Get out !
Come along , Catherine .
It would be more amusing if it were real .
Where 's your visitor ?
Is she in charge of your entertainment again ?
What will Her Majesty say ?
Her Majesty doesn 't know anything about it , and I wouldn 't advise you to tell her . I wouldn 't dream of telling the empress .
She has her own system of spies .
Not for the world would I interfere with your pleasures , as long as you don 't interfere with mine .
Or was it Afghanistan ?
If you 're wise , you 'll find out for yourself before it 's too late !
There are comfortable convents along the way .
All you have to do to gain admission ... is shave your head .
It 's good for the scalp , anyway !
Entirely too many men love my hair , and I have no intention of changing my residence .
- Anyway , this country will soon need a new empress . - You may as well know ...
Peter 's going to marry me when the old bat dies ... and as soon as he gets rid of his present wife !
Dead as a doornail at last .
What have you got to say about it ?
Open your mouth if you can .
In another week , it 'll be full of ice .
In another month , not a soul will mourn for you .
In another year , you 'll be forgotten .
Where is all your power ?
It 's mine now !
Do you hear me ?
Take it away from me if you can !
It 's my turn now !
- Orloff , Your Majesty ,
Captain in charge of the barracks .
Your Majesty , your visit here is the greatest honor in my life .
I 've heard a good deal about you , Captain , from the ladies .
I didn 't expect to see you here , Your Excellency . Why not , Your Majesty ?
This is my pet regiment .
You look ravishing .
Now , there 's another good-looking soldier . Come here , Lieutenant .
What 's your name ?
Dmitri , Your Majesty .
And your duties , Dmitri ? In charge of the night watch , Your Majesty .
It must be cold at night ...
sometimes . Sometimes , Your Majesty .
Anyway , I 'm certain you 're very efficient , Lieutenant .
Tell me something about him .
He 's very efficient , Your Majesty .
He joined our regiment from the Swedish front , where he fought bravely for about two years .
He 's also distinguished himself by exemplary bravery on the Turkish border . This should have been brought to our attention .
I can 't understand why such a brave man hasn 't been decorated .
His Excellency doesn 't mind .
Not if Her Majesty will tell me why she continues to avoid me . Her Majesty will tell you tonight ...
if you will call on her .
With pleasure , Your Majesty .
For bravery in action .
See that you do justice to it in future emergencies . And now , Captain , tell me something about yourself .
Your Majesty , I 'm distressed at my neglect at not having rewarded Lt. Dmitri before .
With your permission , Your Majesty .
Rich too , huh ?
Her Majesty will see you now , Your Excellency .
At last , Your Majesty , I 've achieved ... the enviable privilege of entering these rooms .
I seem to have a faint recollection that you had that privilege before .
Not since the days of Her Late Majesty , whom I often visited in the capacity of a trusted advisor . Tell the others I 've retired .
Send them away , and come back in here .
Her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight .
You may retire .
Tell me , Alexei , are you still fond of me ? Yes , Your Majesty , I love you .
But I 'm completely bewildered by your attitude towards me .
However , I 've become accustomed to regard you ... as one of those extraordinary women ... who create their own laws and logic .
and now I 'm concerned only with your safety .
Is it my safety that concerns you ... or the safety of an empress ?
I would give my life if the woman I adore were not so far removed from me in station . The woman you adore is quite close to you , isn 't she ?
Catherine , I love you , worship you .
I asked you here tonight because I want you to do something for me . I can trust you , can 't I ?
We 'll always be friends , won 't we ?
Yes , Your Majesty . What is it you require ?
Blow out the candles .
Behind the mirror , as you know , there 's a flight of stairs .
Down below , someone is waiting to come up .
Will His Excellency be kind enough to open the door for him carefully ... so that he can sneak in ?
Her Majesty is waiting for you , Captain . Yes , sir .
Thank you , sir .
Will you deliver a message for me , Captain ?
I would be very glad to , sir .
Tell Her Majesty that I quite understand now . No , never mind .
Don 't tell her anything .
- She 'll know .
- Yes , sir .
Something for the poor , Your Majesty ?
For the poor , Captain ?
Excellency ?
Quite a haul tonight , father .
Chancellor ?
Elizabeth ?
Your Imperial Majesty , something for the poor ?
Now what have you got for the poor ?
There are no poor in Russia !
I 've had enough of this sanctimonious talk .
Let us drink .
Why doesn 't he take up his collections in church ?
To the most charming woman in my empire , my friend , the countess Elizabeth .
Go ask Her Majesty , my wife , why she doesn 't join our toast .
His Majesty , the emperor of Russia , wishes me to ask ... why Her Majesty refuses to join the toast .
Tell His Majesty that my thirst is not as great as his tonight .
Her Majesty wishes me to convey that her thirst is not as great as his tonight .
Go tell my wife she 's a fool .
His Majesty wishes me to inform Her Majesty ... that she is a fool .
What is your rank , Orloff ?
Captain , Your Majesty .
Well , you 're nothing now .
Now get out , both of you , and stay out !
Sit down !
My wife is not to leave the palace .
She 's under arrest until further orders .
Am I the emperor of Russia , or am I not ?
We 'll issue a proclamation that she died ... and ask the people to pray for her .
Hurry , Your Majesty .
Everything is ready .
What are you doing here ?
Halt !
Exit Peter III .
Enter Catherine II .
We , soldiers in the service of the Holy Russian Empire , do hereby solemnly swear to acknowledge ... and to defend with our lives , the authority of Catherine our empress , and to destroy her enemies !
Your Majesty , we 're sorry to trouble you , But Her Majesty isn 't in here , is she ? She 's no longer in her rooms .
You infernal blockhead !
This is the last place in the world she would come to .
Double the guard ! Surround the palace !
Find her and bring her here to me !
God grant you victory , Catherine .
All Russia is waiting for the sound of our bell .
Why are those bells ringing ?
Why are those bells ringing ?
I don 't know , Peter .
How dare you address me like that !
My name is Orloff , and I 'm on duty as guard .
I 'll have your head for this insolence !
You 're addressing the emperor !
There is no emperor .
there is only an empress .
Your daughter is here , Mr. Wynant .
Haven 't you got any more sense than to shout like that ?
- I 'm sorry , but ...
- Two weeks work gone for nothing !
- I just wanted to tell you ...
- I don 't care !
Get your things and get out !
You 're through !
- I 'm going .
- Get out !
It 's a good thing I 'm going away .
No peace , no quiet .
Everybody interrupting me .
- Can I come in ?
Did you tell him ?
- I didn 't get a chance .
Dad .
Why didn 't somebody tell me you were here ?
I 'm sorry to interrupt your work . Look at you .
But this really is important .
How are you ?
- Another young man ?
- It 's the same one .
It 's been the same one for three months .
- Forgive me .
How are you ?
- How do you do ?
Take a good look at him , Dad , and try to remember him because he 's going to be your son-in-law .
- That is , if it 's all right with you , sir .
- And if it isn 't ?
He 's still going to be your son-in-law .
You see how much we have to say .
But , Dad , this is really what I wanted to talk to you about .
- Do you mind if I look around ?
- Help yourself .
Tom , show this ...
- Where are you going ?
- Home .
- I 'm fired .
- Who fired you ?
You did .
Forget it .
Will you show this gentleman around ?
- Yes , right this way , sir .
- Thank you .
Mother 's planning on a big church wedding .
Yeah , she would .
I hate all that fuss .
But I 'll do it on one condition that you 're there to give me away .
- What would your mother say to that ?
- It 's my wedding , isn 't it ?
But wouldn 't it be embarrassing , all of us there your mother and me , your stepfather ?
- He can stay home .
Please , Daddy , won 't you ?
- Lf you think it will be all right .
- You lamb .
Now , wait a minute .
When is it ?
I 'm leaving town tonight .
Where are you going ?
That 's a secret .
I can 't even tell you .
I 've got an important idea to work on .
A new invention ?
Yes , and I don 't want somebody to steal it .
But we were planning on marrying right after Christmas .
I 'll be home before Christmas .
- Is it a promise ?
- That 's a promise I won 't forget .
- All right !
- Where 's MacCaulay ?
It 's time I started .
- How 's your brother ?
- He 's all right .
I 'd like to see him .
Why don 't you bring him down ?
You know how it is .
He 's sort of under Mother 's thumb .
Yes , I know .
You 're not missing much .
He 's cuckoo .
Like all the rest of us ?
Has this fellow seen the whole family ?
Yes , and he still wants to marry me .
- He 's a brave man .
- Yes .
Thanks a lot , old man .
- You have an interesting plant here .
- Didn 't I tell you ?
I didn 't know that you invented that smelting process .
This is the first metal that came through , three kinds of ore :
Gold , silver , copper .
Isn 't that interesting ?
- Daddy , does that still bother you ?
- Only in bad weather .
- It isn 't bad weather now .
- Well , you better get home before it is .
All right .
Good-bye , darling , and don 't forget , December 30 .
- Good-bye , boy .
- Good-bye .
Take good care of Dorothy .
Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage .
I 'll do my best .
- Good-bye , sweetie .
- Good-bye , dear .
Is it all settled ?
Grand .
Why did your mother divorce him ?
I think he 's swell .
- It seems he has a secretary .
- I 'll do my own typing .
Dad 's a good barometer .
Here 's a taxi .
- Hello , Mr. MacCaulay .
- How are you ?
- Get under this .
- No , we 're taking your cab .
- Is your father still in there ?
- Yes , he 's waiting for you .
- Did he tell you where he was going ?
- He wouldn 't say .
- Good-bye , Miss Wynant .
- Good-bye .
Here 's your change , boss .
You wouldn 't drive slowly , so you don 't get a tip .
That 's okay , sweetheart , I got it anyway .
- Mr. Wynant .
- Hello .
Did you get my money ?
- I wish you 'd tell me where you 're going .
- I 'm not telling anyone .
- Suppose some business should come up ?
- That 's just why I 'm going .
There 's $ 100 , $ 200 , $ 300 ...
- Here , never mind .
- I wish you 'd count it .
- There 's $ 1,000 there .
- I trust you .
Isn 't there anything else I can do for you ?
Have you bought your ticket ?
- No .
- Let me do that for you .
Yes , you might do that .
You might get me a ticket for ...
No , you don 't .
Thanks and good-bye .
What 'll I do if something comes up ?
Settle it yourself .
What have I got a lawyer for ?
- Is Julia going with you ?
- No .
- What if you need more money ?
- I left instructions with Julia .
She 'll get it from you .
Good-bye .
You don 't tell me a thing .
I don 't know where you 're going , I don 't know when you 're coming back .
I don 't know how to reach you if any business comes up .
Hello , Tanner .
My daughter 's going to be married .
Nice young man .
She just brought him in .
Congratulations .
I 'm going to make her a wedding present .
Thought I 'd better do it now before I forget it .
I can drop them on the way ...
That 's funny .
- Where are those bonds ?
- Bonds , sir ?
I know I put them in there .
Maybe Miss Wolf has them , sir .
Yes maybe she has .
- Joe ?
- Yeah .
- How do you like yours ?
- Straight .
You women sure take a lot of punishment .
You 're in the wrong place , buddy .
Am I ?
What do you want ?
- Who is it , Joe ?
- That 's what I want to know .
- We 're just having a little drink .
- Yeah , so I see .
See you later , Joe .
Sorry , didn 't know I was talking to the boyfriend .
So long .
So long , Joe .
Who 's that man ?
He isn 't anybody .
Just a fellow I used to know .
I thought you 'd given up that sort of friend .
It 's the first time I 've seen him in years .
I didn 't want to give him the high-hat .
You know how I feel about that sort of thing .
Don 't worry .
You won 't see him again .
Tell me , did you change your mind about going ?
No , I just came back for a second .
I want to get those bonds .
Bonds ?
What bonds ?
The government bonds .
The ones you took from the office safe .
Oh , yes .
You told me to sell those a long time ago .
I 'd never tell you to sell those .
I bought those for my daughter .
- Don 't you remember ?
- See here , Julia you 're counting too much on my absent-mindedness .
You 've been taking here and there for some time without my saying anything about it .
But this is $ 50,000 .
Do you realize you 're accusing me ...
No one else had the combination of that safe .
You took them .
What did you do with them ?
What if I did ?
I 'm tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to your family .
That 's my business .
Supporting a gang of loafers that don 't care a darn about you .
A wife that kicked you out the first time you slipped .
None of them would help you .
And I 've given my whole life to you .
If you kicked off tomorrow , where would I be ?
Out in the gutter .
Certainly I took them . Who has a better right ?
I want them now , or I 'll hand you over to the police .
Go ahead !
They 'll be pretty rough with you , with your record .
That 's a fine thing to say to me after what I 've been to you .
Hello , give me ...
Well ?
All right , I 'll give it to you .
$ 25,000 , that 's all I 've got .
- You 'll return every cent .
- I can 't !
I haven 't got it !
- What about the rest ?
- I never had it .
Then there was someone in with you .
Who was it ?
I 'll answer that .
You don 't need to tell me .
I have a pretty good idea .
What are you going to do ?
Stop worrying about your father .
He 'll turn up all right .
Yes , but today is Christmas Eve .
He 's forgotten .
You know how he forgets everything .
No , he never forgets a promise to me .
I 'm worried .
I know something 's happened to him .
What could happen to him , darling ?
Will you stop worrying ?
You see , the important thing is the rhythm .
You should always have rhythm in your shaking .
A Manhattan you shake to a fox trot .
A Bronx to a two-step time .
A dry martini you always shake to waltzes .
- What is it ?
- Just a minute .
Now mind you , there 's a still more modern trend ...
Let me have that .
Thank you .
Certain people have ...
- Hello , there .
- Hello .
Another glass .
How are you ?
You know , we do know each other .
Of course .
We 've known each other for years .
- Aren 't you Nick Charles ?
- Yes .
You don 't remember me .
I 'm Dorothy Wynant .
- Not that scrawny , little bit of ...
- Yes .
How did you ever remember me ?
You used to fascinate me , a real live detective .
You told me the most wonderful stories .
Were they true ?
Probably not .
Tommy , this is Nick Charles .
- Hi .
- How do you do ?
- Have another glass .
- He once worked on a case for my father .
Yeah , some nut wanted to kill him .
How is your father ?
That 's what I came to ask you . He 's disappeared .
Don 't say that , darling .
He 's just away somewhere working .
I can 't find him .
I 've tried everything .
I thought you might know .
I know nothing .
I 've been in California for four years .
What about his lawyer ?
A bird by the name of ...
- MacCaulay ?
- Herbert MacCaulay .
- I 've tried him once .
- Why don 't you try him again ?
Here 's a nickel .
Thank you .
I 'll be right back .
You know , she 's got me worrying , too .
You mustn 't worry about him .
Mind you , he 's a great guy , but screwy .
Madam , I 'm very sorry , but no dogs .
- You cannot take your dog in there .
- I 'm not taking him , he 's taking me .
- Are you hurt , madam ?
- No .
Women and children first , boys .
What is the score , anyway ?
- So it 's you he was after !
- Hello , sugar .
He 's dragged me into every gin mill on the block .
- I had him out this morning .
- I thought so .
- This is Tommy , my wife .
- How do you do ?
I don 't usually look like this .
I 've been Christmas shopping .
- I 'm afraid we shall take the dog out .
- It 's all right , Joe .
It 's my dog .
And my wife .
You might have mentioned me first on the billing .
- He 's well-trained , he 'll behave himself .
- It might bite somebody .
No , he 's all right .
Look .
Lie down !
Stand up !
- Any luck ?
- Yes , he 's just around the corner .
- Your father ?
- No , MacCaulay .
I 'm just going to go see him .
My wife , this is Dorothy Wynant .
I 'm sorry we have to rush .
We 're staying at the Normandie . Drop around and see us .
We 'd love to .
Thank you .
Good-bye .
Sit down , sugar .
- Leo .
- Yes , sir ?
Two cocktails .
Pretty girl .
- Yes .
She 's a very nice type .
- You 've got types ?
Only you , darling .
Lanky brunettes with wicked jaws .
Compliments for this evening .
Who is she ?
Darling , I was hoping I wouldn 't have to answer that .
Come on .
Dorothy is really my daughter .
You see , it was spring in Venice , and I was so young I didn 't know what I was doing .
We 're all like that on my father 's side .
- By the way , how is your father 's side ?
- It 's much better , and yours ?
How many drinks have you had ?
This will make six martinis .
Will you bring me five more martinis and line them right up here ?
What hit me ?
The last martini .
- How about a little pick-me-up ?
- No .
I can 't lie here .
I 've got to get up and trim that darn Christmas tree .
What 's the idea of pushing me ?
Who 's that ?
Probably Santa Claus .
- How are you ?
- Hello , MacCaulay .
Come in .
Dorothy told me you were here .
I was going to telephone , but ...
That 's all right .
Sit down , won 't you ?
- What are you drinking ?
- Nothing , thanks .
That 's a mistake .
I wanted to see you .
What 's Mimi up to ?
Dorothy 's mother .
- Does she have to be up to something ?
- She usually is .
Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant .
I wanted to find out if you were sleuthing for her .
- I haven 't been a detective for four years .
- Is that so ?
My wife 's father died and left her a narrow gauge railway and a lumber mill and ... Several other things .
I 'm taking care of them .
Say , what 's the fuss about ?
Is he in hiding ?
You know as much about it as I do .
I haven 't seen him in three months .
No word at all ?
He sends word through his secretary , Julia Wolf , when he wants money .
I give it to her and she gives it to him .
That 's still on ?
Excuse me .
Hello ?
Just a minute .
For you .
Is there a Mr. MacCaulay in the house ?
Pardon me .
Yes ?
Just a moment .
My wife .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
What were you saying ?
He is ?
Well , where is he now ?
Very well .
Excuse us .
He 's back in town .
Wynant .
Yes .
He 's waiting for me now .
Forgive me , Mrs. Charles , but I 've been so upset .
You know , it 's no joke working for a man like that ...
Well , I guess I 'd better be off .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye .
Good-bye .
- Merry Christmas .
- Same to you .
The next person that says Merry Christmas to me , I 'll kill him !
I 'm going to telephone that poor child .
At least she 'll be glad to know that he 's alive .
Asta .
Hello ?
How are you ?
I 'm Mrs. Jorgensen now .
Dorothy ?
No , she isn 't here .
Is it something about her father ?
Perhaps I can take the message .
Here she is now .
Hello .
I just wanted to relieve your mind .
He 's alive and he 's all right .
Thank goodness !
- What is it ?
Has he found him ?
- Do you know where he 's living ?
At least I 'm glad he 's all right .
Thank you for calling .
Good-bye .
- What is it ?
What is it ?
- Nothing .
That 's not true .
It 's about your father .
Where is he ?
- He 's all right , isn 't that enough ?
- No .
You want money you haven 't any right to any more .
- You got a big settlement .
- That 's gone long ago .
I 've got to find him !
Where is he ?
I won 't have you hounding him for more money !
- I can tell you .
- You were listening on the extension again !
Of course .
What 's an extension for ?
That 's right , Gilbert .
Tell Mother .
What did he say ?
Father 's in town .
He 's been seeing Julia right along .
- That woman !
- She can tell you .
You couldn 't .
You wouldn 't go to her .
I didn 't say I would , but we 've got to have money .
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work ?
Now you 've hurt his feelings .
You know , you have an Oedipus complex and you won 't admit it .
- Please , Gilbert .
- Your trouble is you won 't face facts .
I know I have a mother fixation , but it 's slight .
- It hasn 't yet reached the point of where ...
- Stop it , Gilbert !
Don 't mind what she says , Chris .
How can I help but mind ?
I 'm constantly humiliated because I haven 't money .
- I 'll get some .
- You 've said that for weeks .
Why don 't you see Julia ?
She handles his money .
All right .
- I couldn 't go near that woman .
- I said all right .
- What are you going to do ?
- Just what I said I 'd do !
- You wouldn 't do that .
- Wouldn 't I ?
Just watch me .
Get me Miss Wolf at the Clarkson Apartments .
Hello ?
Miss Wolf ?
This is Mrs. Jorgensen ...
- " I wonder if I may see you ? "
- Yes , of course .
Thank you .
- Miss Wolf 's apartment , please .
Who 's calling , please ?
Never mind , Miss Wolf is expecting me .
Quick !
Send somebody up here right away !
Something terrible has happened !
- Julia Wolf , 145 West 55th Street .
- That 's me !
Here you are .
- What is it ?
- Woman murdered .
Where you been ?
- Out making money .
- Let 's see it .
I haven 't got it yet but I 'll get it .
Hello , Morelli .
Hi , Studsy .
Didn 't you know Julia Wolf ?
Yeah .
Why ?
Somebody just bumped her off .
I thought maybe you 'd like to know .
- Yes ?
- " Telephone " , " Mr. MacCaulay . "
- Who is it ?
- " The police . "
Hello ?
Murdered ?
Yes , I 'll be right over .
- What are you gonna tell them ?
- I 'll tell them everything !
- You don 't think Mr. Wynant ...
- I don 't think anything but I heard a fight in there a while ago .
- All right , girls .
- Yes , sir .
Come on .
When did you last give her money for Wynant ?
Yesterday . I gave her $ 1,000 .
- Seen any signs of that ?
- No .
Perhaps it was robbery .
With that sparkler on her finger , and $ 30 in her purse ?
Looks to me like Wynant came to collect and ran into trouble .
They haven 't seen him downstairs in three months .
There 's a lot they don 't see around here .
- You haven 't heard from him ?
- I said he hadn 't written me .
- Then you 've heard from him .
- Well ...
- What ?
- He phoned today .
- He did ?
- My secretary took the message .
- He said for me to meet him at the Plaza .
- When ?
- About 3 : 00 .
- Did you go ?
Yes , but he didn 't show up .
His house and shop are closed , and he ain 't at any hotel .
So , you seen your duty and you did it , huh ?
Are you going to stop at that ?
No , sir .
I know he 'll turn up when he sees this in the papers .
You can 't think he did it .
He 's not the kind of man ...
Do you know why they fought that night he ran away ?
I didn 't know they had a fight .
Thanks .
We 'll call you when we need you .
- Can I go ?
- Yeah , go ahead .
Mr. Guild ?
Come here .
Here 's something very interesting .
There she was lying on the floor , dead .
Police say she was killed 10 minutes before I got there .
I thought you weren 't going there .
- You said ...
- Never mind .
Did they find any clues ?
Gun , fingerprints or anything ?
- Not a thing .
- Was there much blood ?
- Don 't be so horrible !
- She got just what she deserved .
- Did you kill her ?
- Gilbert !
Why not ?
You had a good motive .
I hope you won 't say that when the police get here .
- You said they 'd finished with you .
- Just for the present .
I 've got my alibi , I was at the library .
Where were you ?
Children , I 'd like to speak to Chris .
Will you go into the next room ?
I 'll go .
I 'll be in my room .
- Is Mrs. Jorgensen in ?
- Yes , come right in .
Mrs. Jorgenson , there are a few points I 'd like to clear up .
- Yes , won 't you sit down ?
- Thank you .
You were in the room with the body from the time it was found until we came ?
Why , yes .
Did you ...
Did you see anything in her hand ?
No .
Are you sure that at no time you left the room for a moment that a maid or bellboy hadn 't slipped in and been alone with the body ?
I don 't think so .
You see , I was so upset , I hardly knew what I was doing .
The medical examiner seems to think that the body had been touched .
That someone had forced open the girl 's hand after she 'd been killed .
Moreover , we found that she had in her possession $ 1,000 the night before .
I 'm sorry I can 't help you .
That 's quite all right .
We 'll be going along .
- Thank you .
- Good-bye .
Good-bye .
Could I see the body ?
I 've never seen a dead body .
Why do you want to ?
I 'm studying psychopathic criminology and I have a theory .
Perhaps this was the work of a sadist or a paranoiac .
If I saw it , I might be able to tell .
Yeah , that 's a good idea .
But don 't you bother to come down .
We 'll bring the body right up to you !
What have you got there ?
None of your business .
- You took that money from her hand .
- I didn 't .
Then what are you hiding ?
A piece of evidence worth a great deal more than that .
- Hand it over to the police .
- I will not .
- Very well , then , I will .
- I don 't think you will .
It 's your father 's .
I don 't believe you .
You 're lying !
There !
Now , will you believe me ?
After all , I can look at it pretty good , can 't I ?
Ammunition ?
- Come on , stock up .
- No .
Let this one ride .
- You better , hard times may get you .
- Who are these amazing people ?
Just a lot of old friends .
Romans , countrymen , what do you say ?
It 's like old times .
Remember the fun we had when we were broke ?
- Don 't I ?
- Those were the good old days .
Don 't kid yourself .
These are the good old days .
I think your wife is great !
Thanks , I wanted you to see her , and I wanted her to see you .
Like to buy a piece of this pug ?
I 'll sell you 25 percent of him for $ 5,000 .
- Is he good ?
- He 's knocking them cold lately .
Ain 't afraid of nobody .
Put that down or I 'll slug you .
I 'll take a large piece of him .
- Having a good time ?
- Swell .
Here 's that man again .
Ammunition ?
Highballs and cocktails .
The long and short of it .
Lots of fun .
Any proser should be punished .
" For tomorrow may bring sorrow
" So tonight let us be gay "
More cocktails ?
Thank you very much .
I certainly think your husband 's great .
I 'm glad somebody does .
- Have a cocktail ?
- Thanks . Nick Charles here ?
- You 're his wife ?
- Yes .
Hey , Nick .
Nice guy .
Sent me up the river once .
Hi , Nick .
Hello , Face .
- Long time , no see .
- Long time .
- I needed the rest .
- Was he a good detective ?
I wouldn 't know .
The time he caught me was an accident .
- I led with my right .
- Come on , shed the " chapeau " .
Divest yourself of raiment and join the Yuletide revelers .
Hey , revelers .
I want you to know Face Peppler .
All you got to do is find out who they are .
Don 't bother to announce anyone .
Just send them all up .
It 's all right .
They 're all his friends .
Here 's the latest on the Wolf murder .
Police now know the secretary was once a gangster 's girl .
They 're now looking for him .
" Wynant " , " her employer " , " is still missing . "
Can 't you fellows ever think of anything but business ?
Good case for you , Nick .
Haven 't you heard the news ?
I 'm a gentleman now .
Nick , reporters .
- Salutations , boys .
- You 're just the man I want to see .
- I 'm from the " American " ...
- The " Mirror " .
We want a statement .
We hear you 're on the Wolf case .
- I know nothing about it .
- Give us a break , will you ?
Listen , I never try to kid reporters .
I 'm telling you the truth .
Then why are you in town ?
My wife 's on a bender .
I 'm trying to sober her up .
Waiter , drinks , please .
Into the kitchen , son , and thaw out some ice .
Grandma , what large glasses you have .
- Is he working on a case ?
- Yes .
- What case ?
- A case of scotch .
Pitch in and help him .
- I 've got to order some food .
- Isn 't it a waste of energy ?
That sounds like an interesting case .
Why don 't you take it ?
I haven 't time .
I 'm too busy seeing you don 't lose the money I married you for .
Room service , please .
Sounds like a good case .
Girl mysteriously murdered .
Nobody knows who did it .
They haven 't found any clues .
No gun , no fingerprints .
I 'll bet you dollars to dog biscuits that they never thought of ...
I don 't want to hear anything about it .
Is that my drink over there ?
- What are you drinking ?
Yes , that 's yours .
Send me up a flock of sandwiches .
I 'd like to telephone my mother and wish her a Merry Christmas .
- Why don 't you ?
- I haven 't got any nickels .
Forget the nickels , there you are .
Go ahead .
Thank you .
Have a hunker ?
- I 'll have two hunkers .
- Attaboy .
Hello , give me long distance .
I want to talk to San Francisco .
Nick , I 've got to see you .
Alone .
Hello there , Beautiful .
- Come on , I 'll take you .
- Look what 's come to our party .
Let 's cross the ice and get away from the wolves .
- Who 's the brunette ?
- I used to bounce her on my knee .
Which knee ?
Can I touch it ?
Well , baby , what 's on your mind , if any ?
- You heard about Julia Wolf ?
- Yeah .
There !
Nick , you 're hurting me .
Of course .
That 's what I intend to do .
- Are you trying to tell me you did it ?
- Yes , I killed her .
Sit down .
I hated her for coming between my mother and father .
She kept me from seeing my father .
I went down there to ask her where he was , and she wouldn 't tell me , so I shot her .
- How many times ?
- Once or twice .
- Where did you hit her ?
- I hit her in the heart .
- What did she do ?
- She fell over .
- Did she scream ?
- Yes .
Which way did she fall ?
She fell over backwards .
Who are you trying to protect ?
Now wait a minute .
She was shot four times , fell on her face she couldn 't have screamed , because she was killed instantly .
- Who do you think did it ?
- I don 't know .
- Where did you get this ?
- In a pawnshop .
- Is that another lie ?
- No , Nick , that 's the truth .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
- Don 't be silly .
Take this drink .
- No , thank you .
- Want to powder your nose ?
- Make her take that .
- Where did you get that ?
- She brought it in .
- Tried to make me believe she did it .
- What will you do with it ?
Nothing , until I find out if it 's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with .
Keep her here and keep the reporters away .
They may believe her .
Isn 't that Dorothy Wynant ?
Yes . Wait a minute .
She doesn 't know anything about it .
- And you said you weren 't on the case .
- I 'm not .
- Hello , Ma !
- Here , give me that , will you ?
- Hey , San Francisco .
- Get off the wire , I want to talk business .
Operator , give me Drydock 4-8000 .
Don 't do that .
Don 't tell your paper I 'm working on anything , because I 'm not .
He 's just working on that little girl .
- Welcome to ...
- Oh , Nick .
I want to talk to you about something very important .
- I know , it 's a convention .
Come in .
- No .
- Got your roller skates on ?
- What ?
Let 's get rolling .
I 'll take you right ...
No , here , let 's , if you don 't mind ...
Just step in here .
Well ...
I 'm sorry , it 's the only place we can be alone .
Won 't you sit down .
Hello , Mr. Wynant .
- Come in and have a drink .
- I don 't drink .
Clyde Wynant is absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this .
No wonder the police think he 's involved .
- What do you think ?
- I know he isn 't .
But I want awfully to see him .
I want to tell him something important .
And MacCaulay won 't help a bit .
He thinks I just want money .
Don 't you ?
You 're always teasing .
- I beg your pardon .
- We 're just chatting .
Nick , you will help me find Clyde , won 't you ?
There are 1,000 detectives in New York .
Why not hire one of them ?
But he knows you .
All you need do is get in touch with him .
Tell him Mimi says everything is all right , but that I 've got to see him .
Again , I don 't want any part of it .
Now , you take Dorothy home ...
- Is she here ?
- Yes , she 's in there with my wife .
What did you tell them ?
- Wait a minute .
- Be quiet .
- Too bad you didn 't bring your whip .
- She didn 't tell us a thing .
I was so excited .
I didn 't realize what I was doing .
Come on , Dorothy , let 's go home .
She doesn 't have to .
You can stay , we 'd love to have you .
That 's sweet of you .
No , thanks , I 'll go .
- Where 's Gilbert ?
- Gilbert ?
Is he here ?
I might as well be living in a lobby .
There 's a physiological and psychological angle in my dad 's relationship with Julia that were overlooked .
I think it settles the whole question .
You see , my father was a sexagenarian .
- He was ?
- Yes , he admitted it .
A sexagenarian ?
But we can 't put that in the paper .
- Why not ?
- You know how they are .
Sex ?
- Just say he was 60 years old .
- Is that what that means ?
Of course .
Hey , that 's my hat !
Come and get it , while it 's hot .
Come on , give us a break .
- You owe me after that .
- I swear I don 't know anything about it .
Telephone , Nicky .
Oh , I thought it was the door .
Mr. Charles ?
I 'd like to lay a proposition before you .
I can 't discuss it over the telephone but if you 'll give me a half-hour of your time ...
It 's about Julia Wolf .
Hello ?
What is it ?
Some guy trying to sell me insurance .
- Where 's Miss Wynant ?
- She 's gone .
- Which way did she go ?
- Out the back door .
- You mean the little brunette ?
- Yes .
I 'm sorry .
Thanks , I 'm engaged for this one .
Face , no , don 't do that .
I want to talk to Ma .
So you think you 're a fighter ?
So what ?
So listen , worm .
Oh , Nicky , I love you .
Because you know such lovely people .
What ?
- Are you asleep ?
- Yes .
Good , I want to talk to you .
That 's jolly .
Wouldn 't you like to do a little detecting once in a while just for fun ?
- Can 't you get to sleep ?
- No .
Maybe if you took a drink it would help .
No , thanks .
Maybe it would help if I took it .
Everybody says you 're a grand detective .
They were kidding you .
I 'd like to see you work .
In the morning , I 'll get you some detective stories .
I know , but that girl 's in a tough spot .
There 's nothing I can do to help her .
She thinks you can .
It wouldn 't hurt you to try .
Darling , my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows about it .
The police will catch him without any help from me .
I think I would like that drink .
My darling ...
I 'll give you your Christmas present now , if you 'll give me mine .
- At breakfast .
- It 's Christmas now .
Breakfast .
What will you give me ?
I hope I don 't like it .
You 'll have to keep them anyway .
Because the man at the aquarium said that he wouldn 't take them back .
Did you hear a knock ?
Yes .
Well , it might be something important .
I 'm sure it is .
- Is Mr. Charles here ?
- Yes .
I got to talk to him , that 's all , but I must .
All right , come in .
You wait here , I 'll tell him you 're here .
- What in the name of ...
- Someone to see you , dear .
That 's good .
I was afraid I 'd have to go to sleep .
Get out of bed .
Let me straighten up .
You 're worse than an infant .
Funny , those blankets must be cockeyed .
Right , Asta ?
There .
You 've got the funniest look I ever saw in my life .
Hurry up , that man 's waiting for you .
I want you to tell me something , and give it to me straight .
Get me ?
Would you mind putting the gun away ?
My wife doesn 't care , but I 'm a very timid fellow .
You idiot .
Asta , come here .
All right , shoot .
I mean what 's on your mind ?
You don 't have to tell me you 're tough .
I heard .
I 'm Joe Morelli .
- I 've never heard about you .
- I didn 't knock Julia off .
All right , you didn 't .
I ain 't seen her in three months .
We were washed up .
Why tell me ?
I had no reason to hurt her .
She was straight with me .
But that dirty Nunheim got sore with her because I clicked and he didn 't .
And he put the finger on me .
This is all swell , but you 're peddling your fish in the wrong market .
I 've got nothing to do with this .
Studsy Burke says you used to be okay , that 's why I 'm here .
How is Studsy ?
I didn 't know he was out of stir .
He 's all right , he 'd like to see you .
What 's the law doing to me ?
Do they think I did it or is it just something else to pin on me ?
If I knew I 'd tell you .
I don 't know anything about it .
Ask the police .
That 'd be the smartest thing I ever did .
I put the police captain in a hospital for three weeks over an argument .
They would like for me to come in .
They 'd like it down to the end of their blackjacks .
I come to you on the level .
Studsy says you are too .
- Why aren 't you ?
- I am .
If I knew anything I 'd be ...
- What 's that ?
- I don 't know .
That makes this your party .
- Open up !
Police !
- Why , you two-timing ...
Okay , Bob .
- Give me that bottle .
- What knocked her out ?
I did .
She was in the line of fire .
Somebody call a doctor .
Here , baby .
Sweet .
- Help her up on the bed . - All right .
Are you all right ?
You darn fool .
You didn 't have to knock me out .
I knew you 'd take him , but I wanted to see you do it .
There 's a girl with hair on her chest .
- Nicky .
- What ?
- Are you hurt ?
- No , he just grazed me , that 's all .
- You are .
Somebody get a doctor .
- There 's one called already .
- Get into bed .
Are you all right ?
- Sure , I can 't even feel it .
I 'll get some towels .
Pretty close .
- Have a shot , will you ?
- Here we are .
But you 'll be okay .
- Tough luck !
- Shut up !
- Here , darling , use this .
- Now , baby , it 's only a scratch .
- Do you want a drink ?
- What do you think ?
How did you people happen to pop in here ?
We hear this was getting to be a meeting place for the Wynant family .
We figured we 'd stick around just in case the old boy himself should show up .
Then we see this bird sneak in , we decided to come up .
And lucky for you we did .
- Yeah , I might not have been shot .
- You know this monkey ?
- That dirty little rat Nunheim ...
- Shut up !
- Is he a friend of yours ?
- I never saw him before .
What did he want ?
He wanted to tell me that he didn 't kill Julia Wolf .
- What 's that to you ?
- Nothing .
What did he think it was to you ?
Ask him .
I 'm asking you .
Keep on asking .
- Frisk the dump .
- Not without a warrant .
So you say !
Go on , Bob .
Tough ?
Now look here , Charles , the both of us are going about this in the wrong way .
I don 't want to get tough with you .
I 'm sure you don 't want to either .
Just one more question .
Are you willing to swear to a complaint for this guy plugging you ?
That 's another one I can 't answer now .
Maybe it was an accident .
What 's that man doing in my drawers ?
Here you are , Lieutenant .
You got a pistol permit ?
No .
- Ever heard of the Sullivan Act ?
- That 's all right .
We 're married .
- This gun yours ?
- No .
- Who 's is it ?
- I 'll have to try to remember .
Okay , we got plenty of time .
I guess I 'll have to ask you a lot more questions than I figured .
We 'll come around tomorrow when you 're feeling better .
All right , come on , boys .
Where 's Asta ?
Come here .
You 're a fine watchdog .
He 's got more sense than you .
I 'm glad you 're not on this case .
On it ?
I 'm in it , they think I did it .
Well , didn 't you ?
I hope you 're satisfied .
Where am I ?
You 're not in a shooting gallery !
But , sugar , this is the nicest Christmas present I 've ever had .
You act as though it were the only Christmas present you ever had .
Where did you get that wristwatch ?
Christmas present .
- Yeah ?
Who gave it to you ?
- You did .
You must admit I 've got pretty good taste , haven 't I ?
Have you finished with this ?
Yes , and I know as much about the murder as they do .
I 'm a hero .
I was shot twice in the " Tribune " .
I read where you were shot five times in the tabloids .
It 's not true .
He didn 't come anywhere near my tabloids .
Bull 's eye !
Who is it ?
Send him right up .
Who was that ?
Mr. MacCaulay .
The Mallorys .
Oh , dear , I forgot all about them .
Aren 't you hot in that ?
Yes , I 'm stifling .
But it 's so pretty .
The Kirbys .
Is that another Christmas present ?
- Did I give it to you ?
- Yes .
I 'm spoiling you .
Why , Nicky , this is from Clyde Wynant .
He says , " Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf 's murder ?
- " Communicate with Herbert MacCaulay . "
- Let 's see .
- Where 's it from ?
- Philadelphia .
Well , then , he didn 't do it .
I don 't know .
He wouldn 't ask you to handle it if he were guilty , would he ?
Your guess is as good as mine , baby .
Nicky , take the case .
You take it .
I 'm too busy .
- How do you do ?
- Good morning .
I 'm afraid this isn 't a very Merry Christmas for you .
- He 's all right .
- Good .
- How are you , MacCaulay ?
- I 'm fine .
- Sit down .
- You 're coming along better than me .
- I hope you 're not seriously hurt .
- No , just a scratch .
I 've forgotten it .
- What a delightful toy .
- That 's Asta 's Christmas present .
I got word from Wynant this morning .
So did we , I mean Sherlock here .
- Darling , will you ...
- Pass you your drink ?
Yes .
Thank you .
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants ?
Slim .
Well , would it help if I could persuade him to meet you ?
It might .
He gave me a code message to insert in the " Times " in case I wanted to reach him .
- I don 't suppose it would do any harm .
- I 've done that already .
He should appear , you know .
It doesn 't look well , his staying away at a time like this .
- Police .
- For me ?
Where ?
Allentown ?
Yes .
When is the next train ?
Right .
I 'll get that .
Wynant 's tried to commit suicide .
They want me to go down and identify him .
I guess this changes the whole story , doesn 't it ?
That looks like an admission of guilt .
And I had such hopes .
I thought if you got on the case you could clear him .
I thought that Mimi , the way she acted , I was sure that ...
Oh , well .
There 's no use thinking about that now .
I 'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time .
Good-bye .
Have a Merry Christmas .
Thank you .
Same to you .
- Bye-bye .
- Good-bye .
Asta , is your balloon busted ?
So is mine .
- What 's the matter with you ?
- The mystery 's all gone .
- I was hoping you 'd find out who did it .
- Maybe I will .
- Lf Wynant ...
- I don 't believe he did it .
- Why don 't you ?
- No reason , just a hunch .
But I 'm going to find out .
I 'm tired of being pushed around .
Come on , Dr Watson , let 's go places .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
Excuse me .
Not a nice trick you 're trying to pull , running out like this when I was giving you time to rest before I questioned you .
What ?
About the gun ?
That never was a gun .
Don 't waste time talking about that .
Look here , man to man , are you working on this case ?
- Man to man , I 'm not .
- But he 's interested .
I 'd rather have you working with us than against us .
- That suits me .
- Then it 's a bargain .
Anything you want to know ?
- What about the suicide ?
- That was a phony .
- The boys didn 't even have to go down .
- I thought so .
Now they 'll think every thin man with white hair is Wynant .
- Do you think Wynant did it ?
- I don 't know .
He planned something .
He closed up his apartment and shop .
- Were you there ?
- Yes , but I couldn 't find a thing .
I figure it like this .
Wynant went to Julia 's apartment and found Morelli there .
Sees she 's two-timing him , there 's a fight .
He doesn 't do anything because of Morelli .
Lets his lawyer give her money to give to him so she thinks it 's blown over .
Then when she isn 't expecting it , he let 's her have it .
- No proof ?
- Nothing as yet to cinch it .
- $ 50 will get you $ 100 that he didn 't do it .
- What do you mean ?
For one , he 's too absent-minded to hold a grudge .
- Who 's your candidate ?
- I haven 't got that far .
Not everything points to Wynant .
How about your alibis ?
They 're all okay .
Mrs. Jorgensen , the boy , Dorothy , MacCaulay , even Morelli .
We had to let him go .
- What about Jorgensen ?
- I 'll check on that .
- Mrs. Charles , this must be dull for you .
- Dull ?
I 'm sitting on the edge of my chair .
- What about Nunheim ?
- He 's all right .
We know all about him .
He does some stooling for us occasionally .
Did you know he 's been hanging around Julia ?
No .
- He 's holding out on you .
- Let 's look into that .
Taxi !
This may get a bit rough .
I think you better let us go alone .
Catch me letting you go alone !
Grant 's Tomb .
Taxi !
- Who is it ?
- John .
Hello , Lieutenant .
Sit down , Nick .
I wasn 't expecting you , Lieutenant .
You said you 'd phone .
Have a shot ?
What 's the idea of telling me you knew the Wolf girl just by sight ?
That 's all I did , Lieutenant .
That 's the God 's truth .
Maybe I said hello to her .
" How are you , " or something when I saw her but that 's all I did .
That 's the truth !
You open your mouth and I 'll pop a tooth out of it .
- Is that so !
- Yeah !
Cut it out !
We didn 't come here to watch you two roughhouse .
She 's driving me nuts .
She 's been ragging me all day .
Maybe if you 'd quit running around after other women you wouldn 't have trouble with this one .
That 's a lie .
Anybody that says that is a liar !
Do you want to take a poke at him ?
I didn 't mean you , mister .
Come on , she can 't hear you now .
You know how it is .
A guy knocking around ...
You 'd have done better to have told me that in the beginning .
Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off ?
You don 't think I was involved !
Where were you ?
- Marion !
- Wait a minute !
I don 't like crooks .
And if I did , I wouldn 't like stool pigeons .
And if I did like stool pigeons , I still wouldn 't like you .
Don 't go !
Wait a minute !
I 'll do anything you say !
I 'll behave !
Don 't go !
Let me go after her .
Let me bring her back , please .
I 'll bring her right back .
I 'll do anything !
I 'll answer anything you want !
Sit down !
We didn 't come here to watch you two dance around the Maypole .
Where were you when the girl was killed ?
I don 't know .
I can 't remember !
I can 't tell you just offhand .
Maybe I was down at Charley 's shooting pool .
Maybe I was up here , I don 't know .
She 'd remember !
How 'd you like to be in the can on account of not remembering ?
Just give me a minute .
I 'll remember .
You know I ain 't stalling .
I always come clean with you .
Sure , I remember .
I wouldn 't blame you if you 'd throw me in the can .
I remember where I was .
That 's the afternoon ...
Wait a minute , I 'll show you .
What do you think of it ?
I think we 're on the right track .
Who are you phoning ?
I 'm phoning your office so they can send out a man to trail him .
- I want to see where he goes .
- Trail him ?
Trail who ?
Nunheim .
Give me that phone .
Bill , pick up Nunheim , tell the boys .
He just left , went down the fire escape .
Cover Grand Central and Penn Station .
Check all airports and steamship terminals .
What 's that ?
No , have Lefty radio all the cars .
He was dressed in a black pair of pants , yes .
How should I know if his underwear 's embroidered ?
What ?
Listen .
They 've been questioning me again today , asking me what more I know where I was that day .
Now , wait a minute , I ducked out on them .
Now , look , if you want me to play dumb anymore , I want $ 5,000 more .
$ 5,000 and I 'll blow town today .
Okay .
Where ?
All right , right away .
Be there , and bring it with you .
Arthur Nunheim , honorary member .
No , not a thing .
Find out about that bullet yet ?
Yes , sir , it 's the same gun that killed Julia Wolf .
And how are your folks ?
Hello ?
How are you ?
No , we didn 't find a thing .
It 's your wife .
And , Lieutenant , I 've got something .
I 've been doing a little detecting on my own .
That flatfoot I married thinks he 's smart , but I 'm just one jump ahead of him .
That 's swell , Mrs. Charles .
How did you like Grant 's Tomb ?
It 's lovely .
I 'm having a copy made for you .
What have you got , baby ?
I can 't quite hear you .
We 'll be right up .
She 's up at Mimi 's .
Jorgensen 's disappeared .
Well !
Chris may be at the club or somewhere .
I can 't see that that 's important .
You should have told them he disappeared .
But he has nothing to do with it .
That 's not for you to decide .
Everybody 's under suspicion .
Especially running off like this .
The police will want a description .
- Is this his picture ?
- I tell you , he didn 't do it .
They 'll want more than your word for that .
All right , I 'll tell them who did do it .
Mother !
And I 'll give them proof .
- Dorry .
- Oh , Tommy !
Please , don 't cry .
I can 't help it .
You don 't know .
You can 't go through any more of this .
Get together your clothes and skates .
We 'll go to my family .
No , I can 't .
But you 've got to get your mind off all this .
Darling , you 've been so sweet .
There 's only one thing you can do for me : Go .
- Go ?
- Go and never see me again .
- What are you talking about ?
- Please , you can 't get mixed up in this .
Do you think I care about that ?
You don 't understand .
You don 't know what 's going to happen .
All I know is that I want you to marry me right now .
I can 't marry you .
I can 't ever marry you .
Dorothy !
How 'd you like to have a couple of murderers for children ?
That 'd be fun , wouldn 't it ?
Perhaps they 'll murder each other and keep it in the family .
Father should have killed Gilbert and me .
Then we wouldn 't have this to go through .
You 're talking like a crazy person .
Why not ?
I am crazy , all our family is .
Dorothy , listen to me .
I love you , do you understand that ?
I love you .
Tommy , Tommy .
Please go .
Sleuthing isn 't much fun after all , is it ?
I feel awfully sorry for that girl .
Find anything ?
She 's ready to talk .
It wouldn 't do any harm , though , to find out where he is .
You know , you 're wrong about all of your children being murderers .
I studied the Mendelian Law of Inheritance and their experiments with sweet peas .
According to their findings , and they 're pretty conclusive only one out of four of your children will be a murderer .
Now , the thing for you to do would be to just have three children .
No , that might not work .
The first one might be the bad one .
I 'll have to look that up .
You needn 't bother looking that up .
I 'm not going to get married , and I 'm not having any children .
From now on , I 'm just out for the ride .
I took it from her hand .
It was Mr. Wynant 's watch chain .
I wanted to protect him .
Well , I guess that cinches it , eh , Charles ?
He killed them both , the Wolf girl and Nunheim .
$ 50 will still get you $ 100 .
That 's enough for me .
Extra !
Wynant 's ex-wife produces murder evidence !
I wish they 'd stop that .
It gives me the fidgets .
I wonder if they 'll find him ?
He must be in New York .
Where do you think you 're going ?
- I 'm taking Asta for a walk .
- He 's just been for a walk .
We 're going sightseeing , aren 't we ?
What 's that ?
That 's known in burgling circles as a flashlight .
Nick , what are you up to ?
What is this ?
- Looks like a hold up .
- What are you going to do ?
I 'm going down to Wynant 's shop to find out why it 's closed .
Why wouldn 't he close it ?
He went away .
He went away when I knew him , but never closed his shop .
I got a hunch .
You think he 's hiding there ?
I don 't know , but this is giving me the itch .
- I 'm going to find out .
- Nick , I won 't have you going down there .
It was you that got me into this .
I know , but this is different .
He 's a crazy man .
He might kill you .
He won 't kill me .
I 've got Asta to protect me .
All right , go ahead .
Go on , see if I care .
It 's a dirty trick , bringing me to New York , just to make a widow of me .
- You wouldn 't be a widow long .
- You bet I wouldn 't .
- Not with all your money .
- Fool .
Well , any port in a storm .
Good-bye , sugar .
Nicky !
Take care of yourself .
Sure I will .
Don 't say it like that .
Say it as if you meant it .
- I do believe the little woman cares .
- I don 't care .
It 's just that I 'm used to you , that 's all .
If you let anything happen to him , you 'll never wag that tail again .
You sure this is where you wanted to come ?
Yes .
You don 't want me to wait , do you ?
Certainly .
You 're not afraid , are you ?
No , I guess not .
All right , Asta .
Asta .
Come on , Asta .
Asta ?
Asta , you 're not a terrier , you 're a police dog .
Back , Asta .
No , no .
Asta , get away from there .
Come on .
Come on .
Hello , Lt. Guild , please .
Hello , John ?
This is Nick Charles .
I 'm up in Wynant 's shop .
Well , I 've found something .
It 's a body .
Stick ' em up .
Turn around .
Now , don 't make a move , or that dog will tear you to shreds .
All right , you can come out now .
He won 't hurt you .
Up to your old tricks , Tanner ?
You 're Mr. Charles , aren 't you ?
- Yes , how did you get in here ?
- I have a key .
I use to work here till they closed up the shop .
You worked here ?
Yes , Julia Wolf got me a job here as bookkeeper .
Well , that 's a hot one .
Bookkeeper .
Where did you learn bookkeeping ?
That last time you sent me up ? I learned bookkeeping in Sing Sing .
I figured it would be an in for me somewhere .
Somewhere they might leave the safe open ?
Honest , I never touched that safe .
Them bonds that was missing , Julia Wolf took them .
Trying to put it off on her ?
Mr. Charles , she did .
That 's why he got sore at her and killed her .
Listen , Mr. Charles , can I take my hands down ?
Okay .
I did do a bit of chiseling .
I come to bring the money back and fix up the books .
Easy .
It 's all right , Mr. Charles , it 's just a pocketbook .
I didn 't want them to find out and come after me .
Save that .
Tell it to the police .
Police ?
- Move over , will you ?
- Haven 't you got that yet ?
You wouldn 't know anything about this ?
No , sir .
Take him down to Central .
I 'll talk to him later .
Wonder what Wynant had against this one .
Quicklime .
Mind if I look these over ?
No , go ahead .
Just rolled them up and threw them in .
Lucky thing for us these weren 't entirely eaten up .
Extraordinarily lucky .
No identification .
He must have weighed 250 pounds , if he weighed an ounce .
Here 's something .
Rubber-tipped .
Must have been lame .
Who wouldn 't be , carrying all that weight around ?
I should say he stood about 5 ' 11 " , wouldn 't you , Doc ?
About .
" D.W.R. "
" R. "
Say , that case you worked on , that man who threatened to kill Wynant ...
What was his name ?
Rosebreen .
Say , could this be the man ?
I never saw him .
I don 't think anybody ever saw him .
He threatened to kill Wynant for an invention he stole , wasn 't that it ?
Yes , but we figured that was blackmail .
Just the same , he wouldn 't mind getting him out of the way , would he ?
Doc , how long would you say this body has been here ?
Can 't say offhand , at least a couple of months .
Couple of months ?
That 's just when Wynant closed the shop .
That 's an open book .
Wynant killed this guy and planted him here .
Julia knew about it , so he killed her .
And Nunheim caught him at that , so he bumped him off .
Boys , I guess we 'll be going along .
Nick , you did a swell job .
You wouldn 't mind paying me that $ 100 now , would you ?
Wait until you catch Wynant .
I 'll get him , all right .
You can bring that stuff all out in the car .
- You 'll run it through the fluoroscope ?
- Yes .
- Do you mind if I come down and see it ?
- Not at all .
I 'm very interested in that body .
Step right over here , Mr. Charles .
There 's the bullet he was killed with , see ?
What 's that ?
Just an old piece of shrapnel .
Shrapnel ?
Maybe he was in the war .
That would account for his cane and his limp .
Yes .
Hey , doggie , come on .
Look down at the floor .
Mrs. Charles , this way .
- Get that out of here !
- Just a moment .
Mrs. Charles , this way , one family group .
It 'll be lovely for the woman 's page .
- Have the police any idea where Wynant is ?
- No .
- Do you think they 'll find him ?
I know they will .
- Got anything else to say about the case ?
What about this Rosebreen ?
Sorry , I don 't know anything about it .
Can 't you tell us anything about the case ?
Yes , it 's putting me way behind in my drinking .
Let 's get this in .
Thanks , Nick .
What 's your next step , Nick ?
Right back to California .
We 've got to rest up from this vacation .
We 'll see you before you go .
- Bye-bye .
- Good-bye , boys .
Back to California ?
My soul , woman , I give you three murders , and you 're still not satisfied .
- Well , if you insist .
- Well , I don 't insist .
No , I wanted you to stay here and find Wynant .
- I did find him .
- What do you mean ?
- He was down in his shop .
- Nick !
That was his body that was down there .
You 'd better lay off that liquor .
That 's a fact .
Wynant 's body ?
Yes .
Don 't you want something to eat ?
Everybody thought it was Rosebreen .
That 's what they think , Guild and the rest of them .
They just take it for granted that it 's another one of Wynant 's victims .
Guild 's hot-footing around now looking for Wynant .
That 's all that troubles him .
What makes you so sure it was Wynant 's body ?
Well , several things .
Hello , Fred ?
We 're hungry again .
And lots of onions .
And coffee .
You 're driving me crazy .
What things ?
What things make you so sure ?
Well , take the clothes , for instance .
They were very carefully preserved and the body was just as carefully destroyed .
Whoever killed him was counting on one thing that skeletons all look alike .
- Well , they do , don 't they ?
- Sure .
You won 't get another swallow until you say .
I happened to remember he had shrapnel in his shin .
It bothered him .
I looked for it and found it .
Gimme .
- How long has he been dead ?
- Couple of months .
Then he couldn 't have committed those murders .
Smart gal .
Wynant dead .
Does Dorothy know ?
No , nobody knows but you .
I 'm going to tell her .
You can 't do that .
She 's going crazy .
She 'd rather know he was ...
I can 't help it !
I can 't tell a soul .
- I haven 't even told Guild .
- Why ?
I want to lie low until I get the whole dope .
- I 'm not going to go off half-cocked .
- What are you going to do ?
I 'm going to get the murderer .
And I 've got an idea .
- Do you want to see me take him ?
- Yes .
- Have you a nice evening gown ?
- What 's that got to do with it ?
Have you got a nice evening gown ?
Yes , I 've got a Lulu .
Why ?
I 'm going to give a party and invite all the suspects .
The suspects ?
They won 't come .
Yes , they will .
I 'll get Guild to issue the invitations .
Who do you think did it ?
Mimi .
Mimi ?
Mimi , Jorgensen , Morelli , Tanner ...
What were you doing on the night of October 5 , 1902 ?
I was just a gleam in my father 's eye .
Now , let 's see , you at the head .
And you on my right .
Thank you .
I 'll put MacCaulay here , where he can help me .
There ought to be a lady next to him .
I 've got Mimi .
I don 't think Mimi likes him .
Then it 's Mimi .
Who goes next to me ?
Suppose you leave that open .
See what you draw .
Put Dorothy there .
And then Tommy ?
No , I 'll keep Tommy on this side .
Put Gilbert next .
Nice boy .
Who 's next to Gilbert ?
That bird that shot me .
Morelli ?
Well , this is going to be good .
I 'll put that slick gigolo husband of Mimi 's here .
- Have they found him ?
- They found him .
Who goes next to him ?
I 'm leaving that open .
I 've a feeling that he won 't come alone .
Where are you going to put Guild ?
At the end , where he can keep an eye on things .
That 's the place for him when the trouble starts .
And the little friend of Nunheim 's , the frying-pan juggler , there .
Nick , are you sure one of these people is the killer ?
Positive .
Nick , I can 't stand the suspense .
Which one of them did it ?
I wish you 'd tell me . I wish you 'd tell me .
- Mr. Charles .
- Yes , Henri ?
I 'm afraid these men will interfere with your dinner .
Really ?
- How 's it going , boys ?
- Swell .
How 's this ?
" Yes , " monsieur " . "
Terrible .
That 's all right .
Your men 'll serve the dinner .
These boys are just here in case .
I think they 'll be all right .
Hello , Mrs. Charles .
Hello , Mr. Guild .
Well , I see you 're all set .
- Do you think they 'll come ?
- Most of them are here .
The rest will be here .
Don 't worry about that .
My men are picking them up .
- Bring them in , boys .
- You 're a great help to a hostess .
I wish I had you at all my dinner parties .
Welcome .
Let go of my arm , you big lug !
Say , what 's the idea anyway ?
I ain 't done , nothing !
It 's you ?
We only wanted you to dine with us .
If you think I 'm going to talk , you 're crazy .
'Cause I was mixed up with a stool pigeon don 't mean I 'm one , too !
Absolutely not .
Will you show the lady a chair ?
On your way , sister , on your way .
- Did you find Dorothy ?
- She 'll be here , don 't worry .
What you need is a drink .
I 'd think you guys would be tired of picking me up .
- Pipe down .
- Step this way , kid .
- What 's up ?
- Come on .
- Outrageous !
- How do you do , Mrs. Jorgensen ?
- How dare you send a detective after us .
- We wanted to be sure you 'd get here .
I told him we couldn 't come .
We have an engagement .
We 're going to the theater .
Nicky 's putting on a little show of his own .
You must stay .
Please , come and have a cocktail .
- What 's the gag ?
- You know as much as I do .
- Have a cocktail .
- No , I don 't care for any .
- I said , have a cocktail !
- I guess he wants us to have a cocktail .
Hi , MacCaulay .
Take off your hat and coat and join our festivities .
Why , Tanner , what 's this ?
They had me in jail last night , Mr. MacCaulay .
Don 't think a thing of it .
Come in .
Take off your things .
What is it , Mr. Charles ?
I wanted you to be here .
I 've got something , I think .
Come in , Tanner .
- Where 's Dorothy ?
- I don 't know .
She was with you .
She left this afternoon .
No , she wasn 't with me .
Here she is now .
We got them .
Picked them up at Penn Station .
Come on in .
- Hello , Nick .
- Dorothy .
- A party ?
- Yes .
Celebrating father 's third murder ?
- They were making a getaway .
- We were doing nothing of the sort .
You can 't get away with this .
How right you are .
Take this gentleman 's hat and coat .
Music !
Much music !
You know , Nick interrupted me at a very important time of my life .
I was just about to take my first false step .
I 'm getting out of here .
No , you stay here .
If I stay , I know I 'm going to take a poke at him .
Then I insist you stay .
Here 's Jorgensen .
Why , Chris !
How do you do ? I 'm Nick Charles .
- Chris , where have you been ?
- None of your business .
Chris , I swear it isn 't my fault .
I tried to keep you out of this .
Take your hands off him .
Do you hear me ?
Chris , what does this mean ?
Sorry we were late , but we had to break down the door .
Chris , how could you ?
Come in , make yourselves comfortable .
Just take the gentleman 's hat and coat .
Come , friends , and get it .
Tommy , how would you like to be end man ?
Mr. Jorgensen , next to Tommy , if you will .
Dorothy , I believe you and Mr. Quinn are over here .
MacCaulay , here if you will .
Tanner , down there .
Mrs. Jorgensen , next to Mr. Jorgensen .
I 'm Mrs. Jorgensen !
Put it over there , sister .
I was Mrs. Jorgensen before you were .
Mimi , you 're here .
Waiter , will you remove the illumination , please ?
Ladies and gentlemen , be seated .
Now , my friends , if I may propose a little toast .
Let us eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow , we die .
You give such charming parties , Mr. Charles .
Thank you , Mrs. Charles .
Perhaps you 'll tell us now why we 're here .
We 're here because I have some very important news .
What is it ?
Just this .
Clyde Wynant did not kill Julia .
He didn 't kill Nunheim or anyone .
What are you saying ?
It 's in the papers .
You mean , he didn 't kill them ?
- What did I tell you ?
- Is that why you brought us ?
I 'd like to believe that .
- I knew they 'd try this .
- With money , you can do anything .
Quiet , let him have his say out .
What makes you say that , Nick ?
I saw him last night .
- Where , Nick ?
- You did ?
That 's nothing .
I saw him myself .
You see ?
I told you .
- That 's a hot one .
- What did I say ?
It 's a frame-up .
Quiet .
When did you see him ?
Last night .
He came to see me in my apartment .
Is that so ?
What did he say ?
Nothing much .
He wanted to know how I was and how the children were .
What kind of clothes was he wearing ?
A brown suit , brown shoes , a white shirt a grayish tie with reddish-brown , or brownish-red , dots in it .
- Tell them , Ed .
- I saw him , too .
He was wearing a green suit and a white tie ...
What are you saying ?
You weren 't even there .
I know , but I saw him .
- Where did you see him ?
- I was gazing in my crystal .
Waiter , will you serve the nuts ?
I mean , will you serve the guests the nuts ?
Mimi , I 'm afraid you 're lying .
You see , I really did see Wynant last night .
- Are you kidding ?
- No .
- What 's the idea of holding out on me ?
- You saw him yourself .
I saw him ?
That was his body buried in the shop .
Nick !
It 's terrible to have to tell you this way , but your father is dead .
He 's been dead for three months .
Pardon me , you have something on your coat .
- Darling , please don 't cry .
- Tommy !
It 's terrible , I know , but isn 't it better that way ?
Here , I 'll take care of her .
- Tommy , you sit here .
- Waiter , will you kindly remove that ?
What , no one eating ?
Mimi , it hasn 't affected your appetite .
Because I don 't believe a word of it .
What 's your proof ?
A piece of shrapnel in his shin .
If he didn 't do it , who did ?
The murderer is right in this room , sitting at this table .
You may serve the fish .
- At this table ?
- Eat something , you fool .
- Well , aren 't you going to tell us who it is ?
- I don 't know .
I thought , if we all had a little get-together , we might be able to find out .
Nice food , isn 't it ?
Yes , it 's the best dinner I ever listened to .
You say you don 't know who did it , but who do you think ?
Morelli ...
- You can 't pin this one on me !
- Sit down !
- Am I the fall guy ?
- Sit down , or I 'll use a sap on you .
I only want to ask you a question .
- Morelli , you knew Julia .
- Yeah .
Was she gypping Wynant ?
- She don 't say so , but I figure .
- Why do you say that ?
Well , once I wanted $ 5,000, she give it to me like that , cash .
Thanks .
Three months ago the night that Wynant caught you in Julia 's apartment , Morelli he discovered that Julia was cheating on him and splitting with some man .
That man was ...
Tanner ...
I 'm so sorry , Tanner .
Don 't you want some wine ?
No , really , Mr. Charles , I had nothing to do with this .
- I told you ...
- That 's all right , Tanner , that 's all right .
You 're driving me crazy .
Now , let me see , where was I ?
Oh , yes .
Wynant went to find the man he accused of having cheated him .
That man , knowing that he was caught dead to rights and with prison staring him in the face , took the only way out .
He killed Wynant .
- Mr. Jorgensen ?
- Yes ?
You 're not eating .
Don 't you care for oysters ?
Why , I was just listening to what you had to say .
Good .
This murderer is very clever .
He studied this whole thing out very carefully .
You 'd understand that , wouldn 't you , Gilbert ?
Yes !
No !
He planned the whole thing beautifully .
After he killed Wynant , he wired MacCaulay using Wynant 's name and told him to close up the shop .
- Which I did .
Naturally .
Then he destroyed all of Wynant 's clothes , with the exception of his watch chain .
He figured that someday that might come in handy .
Then he took Wynant 's body and buried it with another man 's clothes a fat man 's clothes , to throw us off the track .
He even put in a belt buckle with an " R " on it hoping we would think it was Rosebreen an old enemy of Wynant 's who disappeared years ago .
Morelli , would you mind holding your knife some other way ?
You 're worrying Gilbert .
If that knife is missing , I 'll look for it in your back .
After our hero had killed Wynant , he had a brilliant idea .
He realized that he and Julia could still collect money .
Wynant was supposed to be out of town , no one knew where .
So our hero wrote letters to MacCaulay , signing Wynant 's name so that MacCaulay would continue to send the money to Julia .
He even telephoned MacCaulay .
You remember the day you came to see me ?
He telephoned he was in town ?
Yes , he called while I was out .
Yeah , wasn 't he slick about that ?
That same afternoon , Julia telephoned him .
She said you were coming , Mimi .
- I wanted to ask about Mr. Wynant .
- Exactly .
And our hero got terrified .
He was afraid Julia would break down and tell you that he had murdered Wynant .
So he went to Julia , and he killed her .
And he left Wynant 's watch chain in her hand .
- Is this true ?
- I don 't know .
- Why are you saying it ?
- It 's the only way it makes sense .
I hope you 're well .
His plan was working beautifully .
Everybody believed that Wynant was in town and that he did it .
There was just one hitch .
A bird named Nunheim , your friend .
Nunheim began to call on her .
He heard the shots .
He saw the murderer leave .
He knew who did it .
If he knew , he didn 't tell me !
You can 't drag me into this !
Our hero had paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut .
And when Nunheim threatened him again , he bumped him off .
He was very clever .
Everybody , even our astute friend Guild , thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer .
You can skip that .
But our hero had just one weak link in his chain .
The telegrams and phone calls were all very well but no one had actually seen Wynant .
So our hero picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case .
Mimi is the only one at this table who can tell us who the real murderer is .
Mimi , who was it that told you to say you saw Wynant ?
- Nobody told me , I did see him !
- Why don 't you let my mother alone ?
What were you paid to stick to that story ?
It isn 't a story , it 's true !
I did see him !
He isn 't dead !
You 're lying , Mimi .
But you 'd do anything for money .
You 're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant .
You won 't get anything if he 's dead .
- I 'm not going to stay here to be insulted !
- Sit down .
MacCaulay , you drew up Wynant 's will .
Mimi was cut off , wasn 't she , if she remarried ?
I have no right to answer that .
- How about it , Tanner ?
Isn 't that true ?
- Yes .
You shouldn 't let that keep you from telling the truth .
- Mrs. Jorgensen .
- Yes ?
Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen ?
No .
So you see , Mimi , under the law , you 've never remarried .
You 're still one of the heirs .
So what are you holding out for ?
A few crummy dollars , when you can get the whole estate ?
Remember the other two who were mixed in with him on this Julia and Nunheim .
When he thought they might spill , he bumped them off .
You ought to know he 's not going to take a chance on you .
What do you want , to be next on his list ?
Why , you dirty little ...
- Well , there 's your murderer :
MacCaulay .
- MacCaulay ?
Sure , do you want me to wrap him up in cellophane ?
Get in there !
What 's the matter ?
MacCaulay ?
I can 't believe it !
Well , I 'll be a monkey 's uncle !
Nicky , he might have killed you !
What 's the matter ?
You sorry he didn 't ?
I 'm glad you 're not a detective .
Not a hip in a carload .
Well , here 's to you two !
And to you two , too !
- Why , the rat , he can 't top us .
- No .
- Shall I keep these fresh for you ?
- Yes .
My gracious , it 's 1 : 00 .
- It 's what ?
- 1 : 00 .
No , baby , it 's 11 : 00 .
It is not , it 's 1 : 00 .
I set my watch ahead .
Yeah , you set your watch ahead at 12 : 00 , didn 't you ?
Look , you 're in New York , for instance .
The sun rises in New York .
San Francisco is 3,000 miles west of New York .
You 're wrong !
The sun does not get to San Francisco till three hours after New York .
Nick !
Yes , baby ?
Does that mean that it 's bedtime ?
Well , that 's a thought .
Come on , sugar , leave us do it .
Asta , are you ready ?
- And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest .
- Same to you , Nick .
Good night .
I can never thank you for all you 've done .
Don 't be silly .
Good night .
Gosh , darling , I thought they 'd never leave .
I thought you 'd never leave .
Baby , the sun rises in the east , it sets in the west .
If it 's 12 : 00 in New York , automatically , it 's ...
Nicky , put Asta in here with me tonight .
Oh , yeah ?
- Happy birthday , Mrs. Hawkins .
- Yes , Mrs. Hawkins .
Younger every year .
None of your frippery , John Harrow .
But music and friends do make you feel ... - Where 's Jim ?
- He 's in the kitchen , I think .
Just put a head on that one , John .
It 's going to thunder and lightning .
Then you best go lock yourself up in a closet . You made that cake ?
No , I didn 't .
And I 'll thank you not to say I did .
Jim Hawkins made a cake !
Jim Hawkins made a cake !
No , I didn 't .
Only girls make cakes .
My mother made this cake herself .
Surely she had to have a cake for her birthday .
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake !
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake !
Jim Hawkins dropped a cake !
Stop following me around .
Upon my soul !
Why , Jim , you didn 't go and bake a ... ?
Here 's the cake you made , Mother .
I trust it 's good .
It 's the best cake ever .
I raise a mug to Jim Hawkins , proprietor of the Admiral Benbow . - Jim .
- Speech !
- Come on , get up .
- Speech , speech .
Well , I don 't know what to say , but ever since Father died and with Mother having to do the work , I 'm truly glad each time she gets older .
I mean , then I get older too .
And soon I 'll be able to do all the work and won 't have to make speeches .
Here she comes .
Everybody to the taproom .
We 'll cut the cake in there .
Everybody take a seat .
Oh , Jim , there go the shutters .
- Go up and close them , will you ? - At your service , ma 'am .
- Now what ? - I 'm scared .
Aren 't you scared ?
No , I 'm not .
It 's girls that make me nervous .
Why don 't you go downstairs , where there 's more room to be scared in .
- I want a bunk with a sea view . - This way , sir .
Have you seen this man around here before ?
He looks like a seafaring man .
He certainly doesn 't belong to these parts .
Hey !
I want a noggin of rum .
Yes , sir .
Mind , you clod .
Have an eye to that chest . Here .
Now , you never made this voyage , you understand ?
You never seen me and you don 't know nothing .
Get out .
What are you looking for ?
Strangers , sonny , strangers .
I don 't like strangers coming aboard me suddenly .
Makes my spine jump like a porpoise , it does .
- What might your name be ?
- Jim Hawkins .
Now , look here , Jim , you and me 's going to be mates .
You 'll get a silver four-penny bit every month if you watches out for strangers and comes and lets the old captain know when they tops the horizon .
- Well , what manner of strangers ?
- Seafaring men .
Well , all seafaring men ?
No , no , no , son .
There 's a special cut of the jib to these seafaring men .
But most especially , I want you to keep your eye open for a seafaring man with one leg .
- A seafaring man with one leg ? - Aye .
Upon my word , sir , what shall I tell them ?
What do they want ?
Never you mind what they want .
You go on down below and get me a noggin of rum .
A double noggin , Jim , because I 'm becalmed .
Becalmed on a sea of troubles , and I 've got to fill my sails again .
Yes , sir .
Who is he , Jim ?
What did he say ?
I don 't know .
Something about seafaring men with no ears and no legs and no ...
Hey , drop anchor , matey .
We 'll fill the cask where you lie .
Rum for all hands , say I.
Here 's a new port all full of pretty wenches and strong young buckoes .
Clear the decks for pleasant action .
Fill a pretty belly with grog and that 's what makes the world spin on its poles , say I.
Hey , belay there .
- The rum .
- I 'm not much on strong liquor , sir .
Besides , we have to go now . It 's getting ...
" Go , " say ye ?
You 'll stay .
You 'll all stay .
Sit yourselves down on your binnacles .
Jim , matey , the rum .
I ain 't like all seafaring men .
Genteel , I am , and a dove at heart , mates .
Why , I know some seafaring men , them as boarded a Spanish brig all loaded down with Castilian dons and their beauteous ladies .
And what did they do ?
Genteel like me , ye thinks ? No .
They slices them dons like bread loaves and feeds them to the sharks .
And what did they do to the beauteous ladies ?
Why , after courting their favor , as it were saving your presence , matey they slits the veins of their pearly white arms and uses their blue blood to warm their rum .
And then what did they do , matey ?
Bless my soul , sir , what else was left ?
There was the song , Jim .
Singing by all hands .
Now , come on .
We 'll all tip the stave .
Come on !
Come on , sing !
Bottle of rum , you old hag !
- Bottle of rum !
- " Bottle of rum ! "
We 'll tip it again now .
Come on !
- Dr. Livesey .
- Mrs. Hawkins .
It was Mother 's birthday .
We were just having a little entertainment , doctor .
Well , my compliments , Mrs. Hawkins .
- A little brandy , Jim .
- My pleasure , sir .
Come on , mates .
Now we 'll tip it again .
- Thought sure we were in for a storm , but ... - Hey !
Silence there between decks .
You addressing me , sir ?
Is it blowing a gale of wind you can 't hear me ?
What did I say ?
I have only this to say :
I don 't know you .
I 'll split you double , you ...
If you do not lower that cutlass I promise on my honor that you shall hang at the next assizes .
And furthermore , sir I 'm not only a doctor , I 'm magistrate here .
And if I catch another breath of complaint against you if only for a piece of incivility like this , I 'll have you routed out of here .
Let that suffice ?
I ask your patience , sir .
Just a squall from a poor old sailor man who took too much rum over his bowsprit .
I ask your pardon .
It was a nice party .
Don 't worry , Mrs. Hawkins .
Don 't worry .
- Goodbye .
- Thank you .
Praise be , Jim , the man was only full of talk .
But bless my soul , sir .
He certainly can sing .
Well , sonny .
Come here .
Come here , sonny .
A little closer .
Here .
- Now , is this here table for my mate Bill ?
- I don 't know your mate Bill .
- But don 't Bill live here ?
- No .
Nobody but the captain .
Oh , captain , it is ?
Truly , sir .
I can ...
Here comes my old mate Bill now .
Bless his heart , to be sure .
Jim , lad !
The rum .
I 'm becalmed again .
Come , Bill .
You know me .
You know an old shipmate , surely .
- Black Dog .
- Black Dog as ever was .
Come for to see his old shipmate Billy .
- Well , speak up .
- The porter , sonny . Porter .
Well ?
Now , Bill , I 've been after you , now .
No , by the powers , and there 's an end to it !
If it comes to swinging , swing one , swing all .
I 'll part your dirty wig !
Out , you blubberous barnacle .
Next time I 'll sever your gullet .
- Humor him , Jim .
I 'll be back . - Where you going ?
To Mr. Doolittle 's .
I 'll get him to ride to Livesey 's so he and his constables can come and get that man out of here at once .
Rum , Jim .
Rum .
Are you hurt ?
I gotta get away from here , Jim .
I gotta slip my hawsers .
Captain , you 've been drinking too much .
Remember , the doctor said ...
Doctors is all swabs .
I 've lived on rum , I tell you .
It 's been meat and drink to me , man and wife .
And I needs rum now , Jim .
- Mother locked up all the rum .
She said ...
- I 've got to have it , Jim .
I gotta have it .
Look .
See how me fingers fidget ?
I can 't stop it , Jim .
I gotta have a drain of rum .
If I don 't , I 'll have the horrors .
And then I 'll see Flint there behind you in the corner , just as plain as print .
- Well , is Flint the one-legged man ?
- No , no , but he 'll be there too .
Both of them will be there if you don 't get me the rum .
Oh , go on , quick .
Before they come in and slips me the black spot .
- Well , what 's the black spot ?
- It 's a summons , Jim .
A summons .
- Do they wanna kill you ?
- No , no , it 's my sea chest they 're after .
- What 's in the sea chest ?
- Pieces of eight .
Pearls as big as ostrich eggs .
All the gold your heart can desire .
- And just for a little noggin of rum , Jim .
- Would a half a noggin do ?
That 's my matey .
- There we go , lad .
- Wait here .
I 'll see .
Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defense of his native country , England , and God bless King George where in whatever part of this country he may now be .
You are at the Admiral Benbow , Black Hill Cove , sir .
I hear a voice .
A young voice .
Will ye not take my hand , me kind young friend , and lead me in ?
Certainly , sir .
I ... I ...
Now , boy , take me to the captain .
- Well , no , sir .
Upon my word , I dare not .
- Take me in straight or I 'll break your arm .
Oh , it isn 't for yourself , I mean .
- He has his cutlass .
Another gentleman ...
- Come , now , march .
Yes , sir .
Hi , Bill .
Your old friend Pew .
Now , sit where you are , Bill .
Gentlemanly-like .
I can 't see , but I can hear even a finger stirring .
Business is business .
Now , right up to him .
Aye , Bill .
Now , boy , take his hand and bring it close to mine .
There .
That 's done . That 's done .
We 'll do him yet !
Not a doubloon . I fought and bled for it .
It 's mine .
Every farthing of it .
Mine !
I 'm swing on Execution Dock ...
Jim , what 's happened ?
Why , he 's dead .
" You have till 10 tonight . "
Black spot .
And they 'll be back again too .
- Who will be ?
- The men that wanted to kill the captain .
They wanna own the treasure in his chest upstairs .
- Let 's get out of here .
- No . The captain owes us money .
We 'll go get what he owes us .
They can 't take that .
Jim , I 'm so frightened .
I 'll see no harm comes to you , Mother .
I 'm not afraid .
- We shouldn 't , Jim , they 'll ...
- Come on , Mother .
He says there 's gold and silver and pearls as big as ostrich eggs .
We 'll show them we 're honest .
We 'll take what is our due and not a farthing over .
Why , there 's nothing there at all .
There 's some coins , though .
Open the door !
There 's something .
I 'll take what I have .
Up . Down with it !
In ! In !
In !
- Bill 's dead .
- Well , search him some of you brass-brained lubbers .
- Get the chest !
- Aye , aye , sir .
- Jim , I 'm going to faint . - No , Mother .
Here .
Down with the door !
They 've been here before .
Someone 's turned out the chest alow and aloft .
- Is it there ?
- There 's some money .
Not money , you squid .
Flint 's fist .
Flint 's fist !
You below !
Is it down there ?
It 's that whining little sneaking brat .
I should have torn his arm off .
I should have put his eyes out !
Scatter and find him !
- We 'll have to budge , mates . - What ?
Give him the whip .
Wait .
Johnny .
Black Dog .
Wallace .
You wouldn 't leave old Pew , would you , mates ?
After them , boys .
Scour the thickets .
Jim !
Jim !
Mrs. Hawkins !
Here we are , Dr. Livesey .
Here we are .
- Oh , dearie me , dearie me .
- Who were they ?
They wanted to kill the captain .
But he dropped dead just like you said he would .
- Well , what did they say ?
Well , they wanted something up in his chest upstairs .
Flint 's fist or something , I don 't know .
This is all I took .
- Do you suppose that could be anything ?
- Flint 's fist ?
Well , there 's only one Flint . I know that .
Why , it 's only a map .
What are those funny red crosses there ?
" Bulk of treasure . "
Bless my ...
Quickly .
Into the coach , both of you .
- Vance , back here at once .
- Well , where are we going , doctor ?
To Squire Trelawney 's .
- It 's it .
It 's it , I tell you .
- Squire Trelawney , are you sure ?
Sure ?
The actual chart of Flint 's treasure .
The very island it 's buried on .
Latitude .
Longitude .
Jim , now , look here .
The very blockhouse and stockade where the infamous pirate held off attack .
Squire , you get so confoundedly overheated .
- What do you propose to do ?
- Why , bless me for a fat mole , we 'll ...
We 'll dig it up .
Won 't we , Jim ?
Won 't we , young Hawkins ?
- I have my own shovel , sir . - Shovel ?
Shovel ?
You 'll have more than that .
You 'll be the richest lad in England .
- In the whole world .
- But , squire , a moment , now .
We 'll need a ship .
- We 'll need a crew .
- Tomorrow I leave for Bristol .
In two weeks from today , I 'll have the finest ship and the choicest crew in England .
Those cutthroats who attacked tonight have shown us that they 'll stop at nothing .
Others too , perhaps .
- We must proceed with absolute secrecy .
- Exactly , sir . Exactly .
Sphinxes , all . Do you hear that , Jim ?
Sphinxes .
Sphinxes , all .
There 's just one man I 'm afraid of .
And who 's that , sir ?
Who 's that ?
Name the dog .
You , sir .
For you cannot hold your tongue . I ?
I ?
Why , doctor , blast me , I ...
Livesey , you 're always in the right of it .
I 'll be as silent as a grave .
Tallyho , Jim .
- How are you , my boy ?
- It was a wondrous ride , sir .
- Where 's our ship ?
We all ready to sail ? - Not for several days .
Dr. Livesey won 't be here till Saturday .
- Hunter .
- Where 's our ship , sir ?
Ship ?
Ship ?
There she lies .
The good ship ' Hispaniola ' .
And a tighter craft never sailed the seven seas .
Bless my soul , sir .
All right , now , give them another broadside .
All together .
One , two , th ...
Well , sonny , was you aiming to blow the other leg off ?
I don 't think it 's loaded .
Well , you ought to be certain .
You be the captain of that ship , now , be 'n't you ?
- Well , I ...
- Come on , Jim , I 'll show you to your ...
Oh , he wanted to know if I was captain .
My captain is on his way from Dover .
Is there anything I can do ?
No , thank ye , sir .
Just an old sailor hobbled down to get a smell of the salt air and cast these eyes on a trim craft the likes of which you sure have got here .
Yes , I think I have a good eye for a ship .
Do you mind if I just come aboard , please ?
Just for a spell .
Yes , you 're ...
You 're welcome , my man . Of course .
- Squire , sir .
- This way .
- Squire .
- This way , my friend .
Any assistance ?
Silver 's the name .
Long John Silver , they calls me .
- At your service , sir .
- Mr. Silver , sir .
Trelawney 's my name .
Squire Trelawney .
And this is our cabin boy , Jim . Jim Hawkins .
Aye , matey .
Smart as paint , I 'll warrant , huh ?
Smart enough to see you 've only one leg .
- Jim , boy .
- Yes , sir .
You 're pretty smart , Jim .
So was that French gunner who touched off the ball that blew that old leg of mine overboard .
- You served in the navy , my man ?
Aye , aye , sir .
Under Admiral Hawke , off Biscay .
- Under the immortal Hawke ?
- Aye , aye , sir .
Are there many one-legged seafaring men ?
Why , the country 's full of them , matey .
Just like storks on a roof .
Truly , Mr. Silver , I 'm sorry for my bluntness .
Here , matey , you try this out .
Of course , you realize we can only sign on able-bodied men .
Oh , bless me , sir .
I didn 't think when I came hobbling down here that you 'd have any use for this timber leg and me .
Oh , no , no .
Now , you don 't happen to have a cook onboard , do you ?
- Cook ?
Why , no , not yet .
Well , squire , I own a little sailor 's tavern up here , and I can make salt pork taste just like roast pheasant .
Why , damn me , Silver , if you want the berth , you 're hereby made ship 's cook .
Silver , this port is full of the most unreliable men .
Of the dozen or so that I signed on , eight have never come back .
Disappeared entirely .
Oh , no .
Now , ain 't that a shame .
I wonder what could have happened to them .
Shiftless idiots .
How many men might you be needing , squire ?
I should like a round score of stout fellows , in case of savages or buccaneers .
Oh , now , you be scared of pirates , huh ?
Well , Silver , one never knows .
Not presuming , sir , but I know every able-bodied seafaring man in the town of Bristol .
What say you that I fetch a flock of them right down here to you ?
Fetch them down .
Fetch them down , Silver .
Why , strike me pink .
We may get Smollett 's entire crew for him and be able to sail sooner , eh , Jim ? Aye .
Aye , aye , sir .
With your eye for seamen , sir ...
Here , matey .
There you are .
Oh , sir , mayn 't I go with Mr. Silver ?
- Well , Jim ... - Oh , no .
No , no , no .
- There 's a lot to be done .
- But , sir , I want to go . Please .
Oh , now , take the boy along , Silver .
Take him along .
Show him the port , the ships .
Start his education for him .
- All right .
Come on , matey .
Come on .
That 's the way it be , matey .
That 's the way it be .
Then you surely would have been a captain if you hadn 't lost your leg .
Come on , lads , come on .
Overboard with ye .
Oh , yes , I 'd be captain .
I 'd be captain , matey .
Here .
Help yourself to a boatswain 's pipe .
There you are . Here .
- Thank you .
- Let me show you how to blow it .
- Oh , thank you , Mr. Silver .
- Now you blow it .
This is my little inn , Jim , as I keep for sailors as ain 't appreciated .
Mateys , this is Jim Hawkins , ship 's boy off the ' Hispaniola ' .
- Hi there . - Aye , lad .
You might be glad to know that I 've been made ship 's cook .
Just friends , Jim .
All happy to know that old John 's gonna get his health back .
They wouldn 't be needing any other hands , would they , John ?
Them as is worthy , George .
I 've just been yarning with the ship 's owner .
Maybe I can convince him of your high qualities , them as has them .
Oh , John .
That 's the kind of joke , Long John .
Now , this here is Dandy Dawson .
A gentleman , is Dandy .
Took to the sea for the love of it , he says .
Wouldn 't harm a cockroach .
- Your servant , sonny .
- My pleasure , Mr. Dawson .
And this is William O 'Brien .
Now , William is a lay reader in the church , is William .
Lost his ear defending a woman .
A maid in Santiago that he had taken unto his heart , as it were .
- As it were , sonny .
- Bless my soul .
And , matey , this is Israel Hands .
Ugly Israel , we calls him , but as honest a man as you 'll find in the room , Jim .
My pleasure , Mr. Hands .
You come on a fair breeze , Master Hawkins .
Where 's John ?
Stop him !
Stop him !
Here , here .
Jim , Jim , Jim . Here , here .
Who is he ?
- It 's Black Dog . - Who ?
Black Dog ?
Who ?
- What 's he done ?
- He was one of the buccaneers ...
A buccaneer ?
Not one of the pirates that Squire Trelawney was telling us about ? Yes .
He ought to be caught .
Now , have any of you ever seen the likes of him before ?
- No , John .
- He ain 't a friend of anybody in here , be he ?
- No .
- No , John .
That 's good .
That 's good for all of you .
If I ever catch any of you running alongside the likes of that , why , I 'll ...
A scurvy pirate in my inn .
You wait here , matey .
I 'll run and get me sea bag and me bird .
And we 'll go right up and tell the squire about this . Blimey .
Pirates .
Those are pretty boots , Master Hawkins .
Yes .
My mother gave them to me before I left .
And the same size our foot is .
Alike as two sister craft .
- Yes .
- I 'm fond of pretty things , I am .
Yes .
- Oh , a parrot .
- Yes , matey .
If any of you wants a voyage , you go right down to the ' Hispaniola ' .
She 's lying in Wolf 's Wharf .
Is it a boy or a girl parrot ?
No , Jim , a girl , and usually a well-mannered little wench , too , says I.
Pieces of eight , pieces of eight , pieces of eight , pieces of eight .
Upon my word , she 's a good talker .
Well , I wouldn 't say " good , " Jim , but powerful .
- What 's her name ?
- Captain Flint , I calls her .
Here , matey . You take her for a spell .
She likes you , Jim .
- But does she bite ?
- No , no .
Nary a nibble .
- I thought most parrots liked to bite .
- Not this one .
She 's a lovebird , matey .
You know , I 've been thinking about the squire , matey .
- Yes , Mr. Silver .
- You just call me Long John .
- Yes , Long John .
- You know , I don 't think that we ought to tell him about that Black Dog , now , do you ?
- Well , why not ?
- Well , the squire is very excitable .
- He 's got a lot on his mind , now , ain 't he ?
- Well , yes .
Well , now , we didn 't catch Black Dog , and there 's nothing can be done about it , is there ?
- Well , I know , but ...
Well , now , there 's Admiral Hawke .
I remember in a battle off of Lisbon why , a young lieutenant tells him something without using his judgment and do you know what happened ?
Why , that admiral fell in a fit and pink foam oozed out of his ears for 42 days .
- Out of his ... ?
All that time ? - Yes , sirree . Just like two spigots out of a barrel of ale .
So just for the peace of the mind of the squire , why , we won 't tell him , huh ?
- I believe you 're right , Long John .
- Matey , you 're just smart as paint .
Why , you and me 's gonna get along just fine in my galley .
She did bite me .
Now , ain 't that too bad .
Well , matey , I guess she ain 't used to you . She 's a little bit jealous , yeah .
I guess you don 't want to leave old Long John alone , do you ?
You ...
- Just a little kiss , matey . - Yes .
You clam brain .
Is a crew always happy like that when they leave a port ?
A good crew , Jim .
You know , if this voyage were a rainbow and there was a pot of gold at the other end they couldn 't be any happier .
- I 'm glad you like Dr. Livesey .
- Now , he 's a pretty smart man , Jim .
He 's not a sailor , of course . But he can cut you open and sew you up again .
Well , that sewing up must be pretty difficult .
- So is the cutting-up part .
- Yeah , well , experience , Jim .
- I couldn 't do it . - Oh , no .
Neither could I.
I 'd swoon like a lady of quality , I would .
I guess I 'm kind of sensitive-like .
To the squire , with my compliments , Jim .
Mulled wine , sir , with Long John 's compliments .
And Silver forgets nothing .
Along with me , he 's going to be certain that this is a voyage that we shall all remember .
Long John 's a wonderful man , sir .
Livesey , I give you ... Yes , yes , yes , yes ?
Captain Smollett .
All well , I trust . Everything shipshape and seaworthy ?
I may as well speak plain , gentlemen , at the risk of offense .
I don 't like this voyage .
That 's short and sweet .
- Pray explain yourself , sir .
- I was signed on under sealed orders to sail this ship wherever you 'd bid me .
But I 've arrived at the conclusion that every hand before the mast knows more about the voyage than I do .
I don 't call that fair . Do you ?
- Certainly not .
What do the men know ?
- That we 're going after treasure .
Oh , mind you , I 've heard it whispered on all sides .
So has my officer , Mr. Arrow .
Livesey , I never uttered a word .
It must have been either you or the boy here .
Oh , upon my word , sir , I never ...
- So treasure it is , I see .
- You mean you don 't trust the crew ?
- Oh , some of them may be honest .
- British naval heroes , all of them .
Yes , when there 's treasure in the hole , there 's fire in the forecastle .
So I 'm taking certain precautions before we sail . And by your leave , I 'd ask you gentlemen to help me .
Lay forward on the quarterdeck .
- Two inches off those points , boatswain . - Aye , aye , captain .
Captain , sir , what are we to make of this ?
- Why , me and Dick and Allan ...
- I never had me knife broke afore , captain .
It 's a habit of mine on long voyages .
Sometimes hands get restless .
Captain 's right , Jim .
Honest hands never object to having their knives tipped .
Boatswain , take the larboard watch .
Have the powder moved out of this forehold back under the aft cabin . Aye .
Larboard watch .
Spring the hatch to the forehold .
Captain , that means that I 'll have to move all my provision .
I stored them aft especially so the vegetables wouldn 't get mildewed .
My orders , man .
You get to your galley .
The hands will want their dinner .
Aye , aye , captain .
Well , why do you men stand here ?
Do as you 're told .
- Yes , sir . - Yes , sir .
- Well ?
- No sign of arms , sir .
You gentlemen are determined to make this cruise ?
Like iron , sir .
- Weigh anchor , Mr. Arrow .
- Aye , aye , sir .
Now , here , matey .
What 's to do ?
The captain ordered us to move our bunks aft .
With the gentlemen , huh ?
That 's fine , Jim .
Oh , but I 'd rather be forward with you .
Well , how 's this :
Supposing I ask the captain to change bunks with me .
That is , after we settles down to sail . Here , you , ship 's boy .
Get along with that .
I 'll have no favorites aboard my ship .
If there 's one honest man aboard , it 's Captain Smollett .
Honest , if you will , but an intolerable humbug .
I consider his conduct unmanly , unsailorly and downright un-English . Bless my soul .
Why does the captain have to bellow at me ?
Captain 's ways , Jim . Captain 's ways .
Now , I wonder what could have thrown the captain into such a sudden squall , matey .
Oh , well , he wanted to ...
I don 't know .
I wish you were the captain of this ship , Long John .
I 'll wager you could handle this boat better than he could .
No , matey , the captain 's a man of wisdom .
A lot of brains .
Too bad an uneducated seamen can 't open his head and see just what he 's got in it .
We 're moving .
- Well ?
Well , Mr. Arrow ?
- She 's breaking clear .
Haul the halyards around . Set the jibs .
All right .
Set the topsails .
Set the guards and royals .
Belay that canary piping and tip us a man 's stave .
Long John likes it .
And I likes rum , I does .
Lord , for a mouthful .
Is he serving rum aft ?
The squire likes his spirits of an evening .
And he likes Valencian lace around his throat , he does .
I 'm partial to Valencian lace meself .
A tender spot , the throat .
Starboard a bit , matey . She 's luffing .
She almost got away from you that time .
I was looking at old Nicodemus .
He follows us until he gets what he 's after .
Well , we 've given him plenty of potato peelings .
That won 't do for old Nicodemus .
He 's used to following slave ships .
Bless me , the ocean 's full of death .
But it 's cured your lungs hasn 't it , Long John ?
- Lungs , matey ?
Yes , you 've not coughed in a long time .
Yeah .
They 're much better , more shipshape now .
What are you gonna do after this voyage ?
Oh , I 'll go back to that little old roof , I reckon .
Well , would you like to come and live with me ?
- With you , matey ?
- Yes .
You see , I 'll have a lot more money .
And , well , I mean there 's only Mother and me .
And we 've a nice room with a sea view and sea air coming in from three sides .
And you could always be ...
No , no , matey .
I couldn 't .
I just ...
Well , anyhow , you can come and visit us .
- We 'll always be mates , won 't we ?
- Certain , we will .
- Certain , we will .
- No , matey , never spit to windward .
It 'll ebb back on you .
Always spit to the leeward .
It sails like a gull .
That 's right , matey .
Look , Mr. Arrow 's drunk again .
The captain 's got the key to the grog , Jim . - Where 'd you get it ?
- Just seasick .
- Sick ?
You 're drunk .
- Why , sir , I haven 't had a drink ...
You 're drunk .
If it occurs again , you 'll lie in the brig .
- Where 'd you get the rum ?
- Why , sir , I haven 't had a drink .
You get below before I cane you .
Here , you two .
Silver , what are you doing here in the poop ?
- Boatswain , take this wheel .
- Aye , aye .
Captain , for the lad 's sake , Mr. Arrow says ...
To blazes with Mr. Arrow .
You get forward , where you belong .
Aye , aye , sir . Aye , sir .
Good morning , Mr. Arrow , sir .
How 's for a cup of tea this morning ?
A powerful lover of tea you are , Mr. Arrow .
Yet I hopes I 'm the one that serves you your last cup , sir .
- Well ?
- He ain 't nowhere aft , sir .
He ain 't in the forecastle .
Poor Mr. Arrow .
And he stopped by me galley only last night , sir , for a breath of fresh air .
- Still drunk , you say ?
- His weakness was still upon him , sir .
Old Nicodemus isn 't with us anymore .
Arrow must have lurched overboard .
- That settles it .
- I 'm sorry , sir .
This will leave you short-handed , captain .
I 'll have it entered in the log . That 's all , men .
So why should I join ?
Join up with what ?
- But , Henry , lookie ...
- Astern of me , you little runt .
I don 't like you and others of your kind who 've come aboard this ship .
William Henry doesn 't seem happy aboard this ship .
You won 't fall , Henry .
I be right here below you .
Oh , look .
Is that another shark ?
Oh , no .
That 's a porpoise .
That 's a seaman 's friend .
Look , there 's a whole school of them .
- They wouldn 't eat anybody ?
- Oh , no , matey .
Porpoises off the bow is a good sign .
A successful voyage , they say .
Why , they comes right out from port and escorts you right in .
I guess nobody knows where we 're heading to but the porpoises and the squire I 'll wager .
O 'Brien , you were aloft with him .
How 'd it happen ?
I don 't know , sir .
A bit choked up I be , sir .
Henry was my friend .
He swooned , like , and fell like a plummet .
Poor Henry .
Leastwise he 'll never know what struck him .
I 'm thankful for that .
- Boatswain .
- Aye , sir .
- Prepare this body for burial .
- Prepare the body for burial .
Land ho !
Land ho !
Where away ?
Here , here , here .
Livesey , it 's irreverent , but , damn me , come , sir .
Gray .
- Where ?
- There it be , right under the cloud bank !
- There she be . - Where ?
Look , right there , underneath that cloud there .
Bless my soul .
Bless everybody 's soul , matey .
It 's it !
Gadzooks , Livesey , if it isn 't it !
The spot seems on the side of a hill .
Rotten to the core .
Jim , run out to the apple barrel and fetch us some good ones .
My pleasure , sir .
Tomorrow , Livesey , tomorrow .
We 'll land at dawn and we 'll have the doubloons by sundown .
You 're as smart as paint to join up , Dick .
Aye , Dick listened the minute he heard there was treasure .
Don 't you know the exact spot it 's buried , now you 're here ?
Flint saw to that .
He left his ship in the same place as we 're anchored .
He took the treasure and six brave lads and went ashore .
And when he came back , he came back alone .
" Dead men don 't bite nor tell no tales , " says he .
- Well , I 'm with you .
- How about the others ?
Oh , you mean Gray and Allan and ... ?
Oh , they be stupid souls .
Well , we 'll talk to them .
Now , lookie , John , now we 're here how long are we gonna stand off and on like a blessed bumboat ?
When do we strike , John ?
The last minute that I can manage , that 's when .
We could all steer a course for home , but who 's to set one ?
Captain Smollett 's a good navigator , he will .
They takes the map , gets the treasure , brings it aboard .
Captain Smollett takes us out into the trade winds and then one day , they all disappear overboard .
Result of a very heavy storm at sea .
Like Flint ye be , John .
And the flower of the flock was Flint .
Hey , Dick , you 're a nice lad .
Get me an apple out of that barrel to sweeten my pipe with , will you ?
Silver .
Silver .
Silver .
George Merry and the others is breaking out arms .
- Now , I told them you was against it . - Why , the fools .
This molasses is sweeter than Silver said it 'd be .
Ephraim , look-see if that box of prunes don 't turn into powder and ball .
Who smuggled these arms aboard this ship ?
I did .
I 'll tell you when to break them out .
And that 's the whole awful story , sir . I wish I 'd only dreamt it .
There 's your lighthearted crew for you .
Captain Smollett , I own myself an utter ass .
I await your orders .
What beats me is how they 've been held in check so remarkably .
With your permission , captain , that 's Silver . A very remarkable man .
Yes , he 'd look remarkably well swinging from a yardarm , sir .
Easy , Jim .
Steady , boy .
You may have been the means of saving the lot of us .
- Don 't flounder now . - I 'm not afraid .
Let 's see , there are seven of us , including young Hawkins here .
We were nine .
What 's the first move ?
Silver 's anxious to conceal everything and hold on .
I 'm anxious to give him the chance .
So we 'll send the crew ashore alone . It 's my idea they 'll be glad to go .
Think they 'll bark their shins on the treasure .
If they all go , we up anchor and run with the ship .
If none go , we 'll try and hold this cabin , and God defend the right .
Redruth , you load and distribute those muskets .
If only a few go ashore you mark my word , Silver will bring them back , as mild as lambs .
- Come and get your sidearms , gentlemen .
- Come on , Jim .
- You can spy out a lot more for us .
- Exactly , boy .
They trust you .
Why , you and Silver have been great friends .
I know .
Why , we were mates , and we were gonna hunt goats together .
I even asked him to live with me .
He was the best friend I knew .
He gave me this .
I never knew anybody like him before .
But I know him now .
Certain , I do .
Ship 's cook means luck ashore , mates .
Shove off , lads .
Silver has left six men .
One of them might be honest .
Jim !
Who told you to come along ?
Well , nobody . I just ...
Hey , what ?
Jim !
Come here .
Wait for me , matey .
Jim ?
You hear me ?
Jim !
You come back here !
- Hunter , did Jim go ashore ?
- Why , yes , sir .
- I thought it was part of the plan , sir . - Gentlemen , this is bad business .
Now , come now , Tom .
You haul to and think it over .
What are you telling me , John Silver ?
I 'll not listen to the likes of that .
Now , be off . I don 't want my rigging fouled with mutiny .
- I 'm an honest seaman , you hear ?
- Yeah , I 'll lay to that but , Tom , you 're smart as paint .
Why , I knew that the minute I clapped eyes on you .
You ain 't gonna let honesty stand in the way of being smart , are you ?
- In heaven 's name , what was that ?
- That ? I reckon that be Allan .
So you killed Allan , have you ?
Well , rest his soul for a true seaman .
But kill me if you can . I defies you .
That 's two .
- Not Jim .
They wouldn 't do ... - They 'll do anything now .
Our only chance is to ...
Stay below there , you men .
Get back in that hold .
We 've got to abandon ship .
Load the jollyboat with all the provisions and powder she 'll carry .
You men get that boat in the water and get it loaded up .
- Why abandon ship ?
- They 've shown their hand .
When they come back , they 'll board it .
They 've killed two men already .
We 're next .
- Can 't we hold them off ?
- With these swine at our backs ?
If we tried to hold that aft cabin , they 'd burn it .
We 've got to get to Flint 's blockhouse .
If that stockade is still standing , we can at least make a fight of it .
Gray !
Abraham Gray !
We 're about to leave this ship .
I think you 're an honest man .
If you wanna do your duty , come out and follow me .
- I 'm with you , sir .
- Good man .
- Lay aft and help with the boat . - Aye , sir .
Don 't shoot .
Don 't shoot .
- Who are you ?
- I 'm Ben Gunn .
I 'm poor old Ben Gunn .
And I haven 't spoken to a Christian these three years .
Three years ?
- Were you shipwrecked ?
- Nay , mate . Marooned .
Marooned three years agone .
And I lived on oysters and berries and goats .
My heart 's sore for Christian diet .
You mightn 't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?
- No .
- " No , " says you ?
Well , says I , many a long night I dreamed of cheese .
It 's toasted , mostly .
Then I wake up again , and here I were .
Well , if I ever get aboard again , you shall have some .
Well , now , what 's to hinder you getting aboard now ?
- Ain 't old Flint 's ship , be it ?
- Oh , no . Flint 's dead .
But most of his hands are aboard her .
- Worse luck for us .
- Not a one-legged man ?
You mean Silver ?
If you was sent by Long John , I 'm just the same as pork , and I know it .
But who are the rest you spoke about , matey ?
Well , there 's Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney and the captain .
Squires and doctors , says you ?
Gentlemen born , says I. That 's different .
- Have they showed themselves ashore yet ?
- No .
Lively , doctor , lively !
This is the last trip .
So after I was on Flint 's ship , I was on another ship .
That was three years back , and we spied this island .
" Lads , " says I , " there 's where old Flint 's treasure 's buried . Let 's land and find it . "
Twelve days we hunts .
Every day they have worse words for me .
Till one fine morning , all hands got aboard .
" As for you , Benjamin Gunn , " says they " you 're so sure Flint 's treasure 's buried here you can just stay and find it , " says they .
" Now , was that a gentlemanly thing to do , " says you ?
Well , did you find it ?
That 's what your squires and doctors would like to know , says I.
" Yes , " says you ?
Snug in behind that rock , Jim , is my little skin boat and paddle as I made it with my own hands .
You takes it , paddles out , finds the squire and tells him that Ben Gunn puts a heap sight more confidence heap sight , mind you in gentlemen born than gentlemen of fortune .
And then you nips him on the cheek like I does you .
- Why ?
- And then you tells him that Ben Gunn will meet him on this hill .
He 's to come alone with a white thing in his hand .
Upon my word , I don 't know what you 're talking about but I 'll tell the squire and doctor everything that you said . They 've be ...
They 've begun to fight .
Who 's the best shot here ?
Mr. Trelawney , out and away .
Pick me off one of those pirates , if you please , sir .
Move sharply , move sharply .
There .
Hand me that ball .
That 's a score snood !
Come on , my boys .
Stay to your oars , Gray . He 's gone .
We 've got to beach this boat or she 'll swamp .
Larboard .
Larboard a little .
We 're swamped here , lads .
Hold to your muskets .
Jim , thank heaven you 're safe .
Up , lads . Abandon that boat .
Stockade 's our only chance .
It 's them after-cabin blokes !
They 're making for the stockade .
Come on , lads , head them off .
Belay that .
Belay that , you swabs !
They 'll shoot you down like a lot of gulls .
Get to those gigs and get back to that ship .
Come on , lads .
Shoot away , me lads .
That 's the way to waste powder .
The flag spots the house for them .
Hadn 't we better lower it ?
Lower the flag ?
Strike my colors ?
Not I , sir .
We 've little provisions , but we 've plenty of powder and ball .
And by heaven , sir , this spot is England .
Stockade , ahoy !
It 's Silver himself .
I feel this may be a trick .
Doctor , take charge of your watch .
Gray .
Joyce .
What do you want with your flag of truce ?
Captain Silver , sir , wants to come aboard to make terms .
Captain Silver ?
Who 's he ?
I never heard of him .
Me , sir .
Me .
The poor lads have chosen me their captain since your desertion , sir .
What 's your course , Silver ?
One minute 's talk with you .
I 've no desire to talk with you .
If you wanna come over here , come .
But if there 's any treachery , it 'll be on your side , and Lord help you .
That word from you is enough , sir .
I knows a gentleman when I lays eyes on him , you can lay to that .
Joyce , take the doctor 's place .
Well , well , well .
Here we are all together again , just like one big , happy family .
Top of the morning to you , Jim .
I 'd rather you 'd sit down , Silver .
Sit down and toss away that crutch if you 're talking to me .
Come , out with it , man .
What do you want ?
We want the treasure .
We 're gonna have it .
You want your lives , that 's yours .
Well , you can have that if you give us Flint 's chart .
I 'd see you and the whole island blown to blazes first .
Well , that ... That 's an idea .
You give me the chart and the moment the treasure 's onboard , we 'll take you along with it .
And I 'll give you my affidavit , upon my word and honor that we 'll set you down safe and sound at the first point of civilization .
- That 's on your word of honor .
- My affidavit , gentlemen .
And a handsomer one you couldn 't hope to look at .
That all ?
Every last word , by thunder .
Good .
Now you hear me .
You come back here , one by one , unarmed and I 'll guarantee to put you in irons , take you to England and get you a fair trial .
If you refuse , my name is Alexander Smollett I 've flown my sovereign 's colors and I 'll see you all to Davy Jones .
- That final ?
- That 's the last good word you 'll hear out of me , by heaven .
The next time we meet , I 'll put a bullet in you .
- Do you meet my terms ? - No .
Then tumble out of here , me lad .
Hand over hand , on the double .
- Give me a hand up .
- I 'd sooner touch carrion .
Who 'll give me a hand up ?
Before the hour 's up , I 'll crush your blockhouse like it was a puncheon .
Them of you that dies will be lucky .
Inside .
Clear decks for action .
Quarters , all hands .
They 'll board us in a minute .
Now , get over that wall first , and don 't use your muskets only as the last resort .
Morgan , you and yours to the larboard .
Job , you and yours to the starboard .
Now , by the powers , board them .
- Here they come , captain !
- Fire when they top the wall .
Another load , Jim .
More loads , Hawkins . Come , boy .
- Trelawney , sir , you 're a man .
- And you 're a captain , sir .
At them , you dogfish !
At them !
Outside , lads .
Outside and fight them in the open .
Cutlasses .
Lively , lively , lads .
My compliments , Mr. Gray .
I 've been looking for this .
Inside the house , lads .
They 've gone .
Fire from cover .
You crawling squid .
You dogfish .
Don 't mind me , sir .
Watch them .
They 've turned tail for the moment .
My case , Jim .
- Hunter and Joyce are dead , sir .
- My case , Jim .
- Captain Smollett has a ball in his shoulder .
- Oh , yes .
- God rest Hunter and Joyce .
- Amen .
- How many did they lose ?
- Seven .
They 've had their rations for today .
Well , that makes them nine against our five , gentlemen .
- Precious sight more confidence , eh ?
- Yes , sir .
Here 's Gray .
Well ?
Well , Gray ?
They 're all camped down by the swamp .
I heard them .
They 're like hornets , and Silver 's the maddest .
- It looks like tomorrow will finish us .
- What 's in the wind ?
They 're building rafts and floating the cannon in from the ship .
Silver says he 's going to blow this blockhouse to limbo .
That settles it .
This Ben Gunn may be our last chance .
- You sure he 's all right in the head ?
- Well , he 's rather silly , sir .
He told me to nip the squire .
Nip me ?
How ?
Begging your pardon , sir , like this .
- A lunatic .
- No harm in finding out .
I have two hours before dawn .
I 'll haunt that clearing all day .
It 'll take them all day to get that gun ashore .
If they turn up again , God be with you , gentlemen .
- Godspeed , doctor .
- Good luck , doctor .
What 's the doctor up to ?
Oh , he thinks this Ben Gunn fellow can help us .
How is beyond me .
Says he , says them , says I , says nothing .
We can 't hold out against cannon , Smollett .
If we could only get out and cut that ship adrift that 'd put an end to the cannon .
Cut off their base of supplies .
We 've no boat .
They 're undoubtedly watching the gigs .
I know , I know .
The doctor 's right .
Our only chance is this Gunn fellow .
- Keep near the house , Jim .
- Oh , yes , sir .
It 's just hot in here , sir .
Go on , make your play .
Make your play , I says !
Let 's talk .
Silver 's tangled everything , I tell you .
Stow that drunken guff and make your play .
I be 'n't drunk , and Silver 's a fool .
You 're the fool , William .
And your face fair makes me bilious , it does .
Fool , bilious , eh ?
We 're adrift !
Adrift we be !
- Why , the anchor 's gone !
- The hawser 's parted !
Up with the jib , we 'll swing into the reef .
Come aboard , Mr. Hands .
Much hurt ?
Not the way poor dear William be .
He wasn 't much of a sailor , was William .
Where might you come from ?
I 've come aboard to take possession of this ship , Mr. Hands and you can regard me as captain until further notice .
Well , now , Captain Hawkins and who 's to sail her , without you get the hint from me ?
- Well ...
- Now , look here you give me me food and me drink and a bit of a scarf or a handkerchief to bind up me wound with and I 'll show you how to sail her .
Now , that 's square all round , ain 't it ?
Done , Mr. Hands .
Now , I can 't have these colors , Mr. Hands and by your leave , I 'll strike them .
God save the king , and there 's an end to Captain Silver .
Now your wound , Mr. Hands .
I won 't be forgetting about this , Captain Hawkins .
And where might we be a-sailing to ?
Not back to the anchorage , you can be sure .
I 've seen a map of this island .
- Do you know a cove called North Inlet ?
- That I do .
It 's a way north , on the other shore , it be .
Well , that 's where we 're sailing to .
I 'm gonna run her high and dry on the beach where nobody will be able to find her excepting honest people .
Now , does that suit your curiosity , Mr. Hands ?
Why , Captain Hawkins , under my present unfortunate circumstances to a plum .
Aye , she 's headed right now .
Right , captain .
Now lash the wheel and come forward for a close haul on the jib .
Right .
It 's been a tiresome voyage .
Why , you can stand .
And I can walk too .
Perhaps you 'll be needing a little rest , Captain Hawkins .
Wet powder , Captain Hawkins .
One more step , Mr. Hands , and I 'll blow your brains out .
Dead men don 't bite , you know .
I reckon you and me will have to sign articles , Jim .
I 'd have had you but for that lurch there .
I don 't have much luck , not I.
It looks like I 'll have to ...
Dr. Livesey .
Dr. Livesey .
Pieces of eight .
Well , if it ain 't Jim Hawkins .
Dropped in sort of friendly-like , huh ?
What have you done with my friends ?
Have you killed them ?
Oh , no .
Blood spilling 's all over , Jim .
We signed a treaty , Jim .
Treaty ?
What kind of a treaty ?
Well , we give them their freedom out of here in return for half of their provisions .
But where did they go ?
Oh , they just wandered away .
But if you 're of mind to hunting them up , why , you just save your time , Jim because they don 't want to have nothing to do with you .
- You 're lying .
- No , Jim .
Why , the squire told me right to my face that you was a deserter and the doctor ...
Oh , the doctor said that you was scared .
But they couldn 't think that .
They wouldn 't , not after ...
Naturally , I 've always wanted you to join up with us and take your share .
- Now it looks like you 'll have to .
- Well , supposing I said no .
Well , even if you do get the treasure your ship 's lost , your men lost , your whole business gone to wreck .
- If you want to know who did it , it was I.
- You , Jim ?
I was in the apple barrel that night and heard you .
I cut the ship 's hawser and killed those two aboard her and I took her where you 'll never see her again , none of you .
Kill me if you want , but the laugh 's on my side , and I 'll die laughing at the lot of you .
I believe you would , matey .
He faked the map from Billy Bones .
First and last we 've been fouled by him .
Avast there !
Be you captain here , Morgan ?
- Tom 's right .
- I 'm the captain I say what 's right .
- I 'll be hanged if I 'll be hazed by you , John ...
- You want to have it out with me ?
That 's better , George Merry .
Why , this boy 's got more fight in him than the whole of you .
I like this boy and if you understand King George 's English you better not lay a hand on him .
Well , you makes a hash of this cruise .
You 're a bold man to say no to that .
And second , there 's that boy .
He 's earned a proper killing .
In the third place , you wouldn 't let us attack them , and they on the march .
And fourth , you let the enemy out of this trap for nothing .
Oh , we get the stores and the powder but we didn 't get the map , did we ?
And what do we want here except for the map , I 'd like to know .
Quiet , by George !
- By thunder , it 's it .
- Look : " J.F. "
Flint 's initials , with a score below and a clove hitch .
Good old Silver !
Long John forever !
- Aye , Silver !
- Hurrah for Silver .
- Where 'd you get the map ?
- From Dr. Livesey , matey .
You couldn 't have gotten it unless you killed them .
No .
That 's part of the bargain , matey .
They gets their freedom and we gets the treasure .
Will you join me in a bit of fresh air , matey ?
There 's so much stupidity in here that I can 't breathe properly .
Come on .
Guess that ends everything , now that you 've got the map .
No , matey , you 've still got a chance for a share .
No , I thank you but I want you to know I 'm grateful for you defending me .
Now I best go and hunt up my friends .
Goodbye .
Here , you better stay here for a spell .
Maybe the squire and the doctor have had a little change of heart about you .
Well , yes , but ...
Well , I might need you for a hostage .
Come on , sit down .
Hostage ?
What do you need a hostage for ?
You said you 'd made a treaty .
Well , treaties are only good until you find a chance to break them , matey .
That isn 't very honorable .
It 's smart , Jim .
You see what being honorable done for me ?
- I had to show them the map , didn 't I ?
- Well , why were you keeping it from them ?
There 's too many of them to share the treasure with .
I just trying to figure a way to get rid of about half of them .
- Oh , I see .
More murders .
- Oh , no , not murder .
Tactics .
I recall taking a prize ship off of Peru once and there was too many of them to share the treasure with so Flint and me , we waits till all hands are asleep ...
I don 't wish to hear about it .
All right , Jim .
Well , what did you do with them ?
Flint , he has a little hammer , so we go around to all the bunks and we get in back of the men and then we ...
Never mind .
I don 't wish to hear about it .
Oh , all right .
It ain 't important .
We only disposed of 13 men .
Blockhouse , ahoy .
What about it , Silver ?
Have you seen anything of Jim Hawkins ?
- Why ...
- Here I am , Dr. Livesey .
Thank heaven you 're safe .
Let me talk with him .
- No , by the powers .
They 'll pull a trick .
- Please .
I 'll be telling you for the last time , George Merry , you drop his arm .
You give me your word of honor that you won 't slip your cable , Jim ?
- I do .
- Well , all right , then .
We 'll go down and have a yarn with the good doctor .
Dr. Livesey .
Where did you all go ?
Why did you give up to them ?
All I can tell you now is that we 're safe and sound .
But where did you go , lad ?
We searched everywhere .
Then you didn 't think I deserted you , sir , and that I was scared ?
Not a thought of it , lad .
You said that they said I was scared , that they didn 't want me .
Well , matey , I thought it would be easier for you to join up that way .
- Oh , I didn 't join , sir . Truly , I didn 't .
- But where did you go , Jim ?
What ... ?
I ran away to cut the ship 's hawser , like Captain Smollett wanted .
- I have her beached at North Inlet now , sir .
- North Inlet , eh ?
Float her and get her away from here .
Don 't mind about me .
One budge of your hand , Silver , and I fire .
Quick , now .
Quick , Jim .
Whip over the wall and run for it .
Oh , no , sir , I passed my word ...
What 's your word to these scoundrels ?
Quick , head for cover .
Sir , it was my word of honor , no matter whom it 's to .
I can 't break it .
A lad of honor .
I counted on that , sir .
Jim , we won 't leave this island without you , my word on that .
- You 're going for the treasure now , eh ?
- There where we be going .
Well , mark you , Silver :
When you find it , prepare for squalls .
And if Jim Hawkins here is so much as scratched there 'll be a ball between your eyes that nobody will bother to remove .
Squalls , eh , matey ?
Am I off my course and sitting on a waterspout ?
I 'd almost wager .
East-southeast two points east .
- I thought so .
Just as the chart says .
Why , that 's one of the six brave lads that Flint killed and laid their bones right in a line with the treasure .
There 's five more of them ahead between us and the doubloons .
Forward .
Darby McGraw !
Darby McGraw !
Hark , ye .
Darby McGraw !
Darby McGraw !
That 's him , I tell you .
I 've heard Flint calling Darby a hundred times .
Fetch aft the rum !
- Them was his last words aboveboard .
- That fixes it . I 'm done .
Where might I hear that voice afore ?
Nobody but us on this island knows them words .
That 's Flint 's spirit .
Nothing but flesh and blood can talk .
I was never afeard of Flint alive , and I ain 't scared to face him dead .
Come on , if you 're coming .
There it be , mates , right in the clearing there .
At it , mates .
All together .
- Why , there 's nothing there at all .
- Nothing , Jim .
We 've been out-sailed .
Here , Jim .
Take that and stand by for trouble .
Two guineas .
That 's your 700,000 pounds , is it ?
Why don 't you dig a little deeper , lads .
Maybe you 'll find radishes and turnips .
It 's only an old cripple and a boy .
Let 's settle it .
Let them have it .
That 'll hold them for good and all , Gray .
Dr. Livesey , where did you come from ?
- How did you happen ... ?
- We thought we 'd be useful , Jim .
Look , sir , there 's no treasure at all .
We 've come all this way and everybody 's been killed for nothing .
Upon my word , sir , I don 't understand it .
Well , don 't try , Jim .
We 'll go up to Ben Gunn 's cave .
Maybe old Ben 's got another trick in his beard .
Beard ?
Cave ?
Upon my word , sir .
Thank ye kindly , doctor , and quite a squall it were .
By the powers .
That voice .
- So it be you , Ben Gunn .
- How do you do , Mr. Silver ?
" Pretty well , I thank you , " says you .
Ben , Ben .
To think as you 've done me .
Gray , lead the way with Jim .
March , Silver .
You 'll find as how you 've been done by everybody .
- Well , have you had enough action , me lad ?
- No , thank you .
Keep going , keep going .
Why , bless my soul ...
But ...
What 's ... ?
Upon my soul , how did it all get here ?
All found and carried up here with my own hands , says I.
" Very thoughtful , " says you ?
And you can be full of cheese from now on , says I.
" Yes , " says you ?
Yes , says I.
Be it all here , Ben Gunn ?
You don 't be holding out any on us , now , be you ?
Mr. Silver , says I.
- Silver .
- Aye , aye , sir .
Well , captain , I reports back to duty .
Me and Jim played a powerful trick on them .
Now that we all have the treasure , why , we 're all one big , happy family .
We 've got the treasure .
We .
You 're going back to stand trial in England for mutiny and murder , my man .
Look , Jim .
Rubies with fire in them .
Them 's pretty harsh measures .
Pretty strong medicine , captain , for just a little infraction of the rules .
Not nearly so harsh or strong as the rope I hope to see you hanging from at Execution Dock .
You 're under arrest , Silver .
- ' Hispaniola ' ahoy !
- Ahoy !
Ahoy !
Don 't leave me !
Don 't leave me , I 'll stand trial !
We 'll starve .
We 'll starve !
You had your chance , my friends .
We 'll pick up a new crew at Jamaica .
Did the frigate answer our signal ?
She says , " Come aboard , Hampton commanding . "
Good .
Ben Gunn , stay alert , now .
- We want no strange craft alongside .
- Aye , sir .
A British ship of the line .
And tomorrow we may have the pleasure of seeing Silver hanging to a yardarm .
Well , Jim , do you come to take old John aloft for a breather ?
No .
I fetched you this instead .
Thank ye , matey , but I ain 't much for spirits .
Well , I thought you might like to start and drink a lot of it .
- Why ?
- Well , doesn 't everybody ?
I mean , before they 're hanged ?
Hanged , matey ?
They went over to a frigate that 's lying here .
They 're not gonna wait till we get to England .
Captain says we can hold a naval trial tomorrow and the squire says we can see you swinging from a yardarm .
That ain 't just exactly a breather , be it , Jim ?
I 'm sorry .
Truly , I am .
You say they all went over ?
No , they left Ben Gunn on watch .
Well , Jim I guess you 'll have to stand on deck and watch me swing .
I can 't bear the thought of it .
Of you , of anybody .
Oh , we won 't think about that , Jim .
You just dies , and that 's that .
Quite often , though , not as quick as people think , Jim .
- Why not ?
- Well you take my case , as it were .
Now , there I 'll be , way out on that yardarm .
Way out there with a rope around my neck .
And then they gives the orders to jump .
And when the average man jumps and reaches the end of that rope snaps his head around , way around like that .
That 's the average man .
But of course , with me , it 's a little bit different .
With my one leg , you see , I 'd be kind of off-balance .
And if they didn 't get that noose just right right there , why , I 'd probably just slowly strangle and choke just so I didn 't swallow my tongue .
But that very rarely happens , Jim , swallowing the tongue .
Stop , stop !
I don 't know how you 'll get by Ben Gunn but you 're free from here , at least .
There .
- Oh , that 's my matey .
If ever the day comes that I can help you , why , I ... I 'm going to ...
What 's the matter ?
I guess you 'll have to help me up , matey .
It 's my rheumatism .
This place is damp in here .
No , no , no .
I 'm ticklish under my arm .
Thank ye , matey , thank ye .
Where 's Ben Gunn ?
Sitting up by the mizzenmast on guard .
You run aft and get me a pistol .
- No , there 'll be no blood spilled in this .
- Oh , no , not for Ben Gunn .
Why , I can talk with Ben , he and me are old shipmates .
Just for protection on shore , you know .
It 's a wild place , Jamaica .
All right .
But I told you , you mustn 't .
Now , ain 't that terrible ?
He 's left to guard a ship , and there he lays in a drunken stupor .
But he has a awful large bump on his head .
Well , he must have got that when he fell off of there and hit the deck with his head .
Ain 't that too bad .
Well , matey ... What old Long John 's got to tell you , he don 't know how to say it .
I don 't mean that you 'll be forgiving me all the bad things that I 've done but just for the mateys that we might have been .
You won 't be a pirate anymore , will you ?
You won 't steal ?
No , sir .
From now on my course is going to be a straight , honest one , so help me .
Why , shiver my timbers , I ...
Well , now , I 'm glad that happened , matey .
That 's just what I was trying to tell you , and I didn 't know how .
I cut through the bulkhead , into where the treasure was and took off just one sack of gold .
But you promised you wouldn 't .
Well , I took that before I promised .
But it 's off my conscience now and the Lord knows my conscience won 't stand any more , matey .
- Well , here .
You may need it .
- No , no , no , thanks .
But you have to buy food .
No , that 's all right , Jim .
I 'll get along all right .
I 'll get along all right .
Well , matey ...
Here .
Feed her good .
And put her ...
You put her down below decks when any women around , huh ?
I will .
I promise I will .
Oh , belay that .
Don 't do that . Our courses will cross again sometime .
Lookie . Lookie , now .
Now , you didn 't get all of that bar silver on that island , now , did you ?
- No .
- Well , who knows ?
Maybe someday you 'll have a great big ship .
Bigger than this one .
And you 'll go down there and get the rest of that treasure , now , won 't you ?
And you might be needing a mate or a captain , huh ?
- I guess so .
- All right .
And who do you think would come hobbling along for that berth but old Long John Silver ?
It 'd be Honest Long John then .
And together , we 'd go down there and dig up that treasure and we 'd scour all the seas for all the treasures on those islands .
And we 'd hunt goats .
And fight cannibals .
It 's true , matey .
Certain , we will .
Certain , we will .

Song helps us to live and to love
Like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
We are able to sing and laugh , like children
Among obdurate fight and work
So we were born like this
And who with song strides through life
And who with song strides through life
A FILM BY ALEXANDER MEDVEDKIN PRODUCED IN 1934 BY MOSKINO KOMBINAT STUDIO
HAPPINESS
Or the story of unlucky Khmyr , his horse-wife Anna , his wealthy neighbour Foka .
To the last lazy kolkhozian .
What is happiness ?
That 's what I call living like a tsar !
Sixty years I 've slaved and I 've never tasted vareniki .
And the old man swore he would not die until he had tasted some of those cakes .
One broken padlock , 1 rouble 50 . Planks for coffin , 2 roubles 15 . And for the nails , 65 kopeks .
The money ! Quick , the money !
Go and find happiness and don 't come back empty-handed .
At the same time , in Tyr , lived Saint Epiphany .
Take those 5 kopeks , father !
Buy something nice for your wife !
We 'll light a candle to Saint Epiphany .
To the left , of death thou shalt die .
Straight on , of death thou shalt expire . Right , thou shalt neither die nor live .
A merchant was returning from the market ...
Swimming or diving , I shall have that money !
Why did you die , grandfather ?
Here is happiness !
But the horse had a voracious appetite and Khmyr had no more hay to give it .
Sweet Jesus ! You who gave me this horse ... Lord , give me a life of ease and plenty .
My master !
" If I were tsar , " I 'd eat but the fat of the bacon ... "
Bloodsucker !
Atheist !
Split the harvest 50 / 50 .
And Khmyr had a bumper harvest .
One in the field , seven at the feast !
For this , for that , for the tax , for the arrears ... For the hay , labour , seed , harrow , wheat , potatoes and the coffin .
Help !
Stop , thief !
For ten years I 've been a thief in Voroneje . For three years I stripped Tsarevo-Kokchaisk bare . And never has anyone cheated me like this .
Respected guests , is it my fault ?
Fortune simply refuses my company .
You vulture !
Here 's one rouble twenty , go to bed !
I 'm going to die !
If the moujik dies , you 'll have to explain it to the tsar and to God !
Sacrilege !
Do you think you can die without permission ?
If the moujik dies , who will feed Russia ?
Who gave you permission to die all alone ?
Who gave you the right to an improvised death ?
Whip him till he bleeds but keep him alive !
So they whipped Khmyr for thirty years and three . And they shot him on 12 fronts .
And 7 times they killed him in the Carpathians .
All of which made him lose all faith in happiness .
And even when he found himself in a kolkhoz , he was the worst of water-bearers .
Anna was happy and she bloomed .
The engine needs water .
Foka , the enemy who was spared , was still around .
He 'll not turn his nose up at what 's offered on a plateau .
I 'll report you , you lazybones !
And I 'll put you on a charge , you alcoholic !
Let me go , Annushka , leave the kolkhoz and be free !
Outside , I 'm my own boss , my own master ...
Are you afraid of being without bread all winter ?
Stay here and guard your kolkhoz 's harvest .
Guard it like the apple of your eyes !
But on this land there were still rogues .
Anna Khmyrova , 283 units of work .
A priest can die , then !
Go , Khmyr !
We 'll never make a man of you !
Why are you crying , Khmyr ?
How could I not cry ?
I cannot live like before . I don 't know how to live like now .
Come , my dear Khmyr .
I shall teach you how we can live ...

My Leader :
Around you stand the flags and standards of this National Socialism .
Only when they are threadbare ... will the people be able to understand ... by hindsight , the greatness of our time ... because of what you , my Leader , mean to Germany !

Our thanks is the vow to stand with you ... in good days and bad ... come what may . !

From the proclamation of the Führer read by Wagner
Adolf Wagner , Gauleiter of Munich-Upper Bavaria Adolf Bavarian Interior Minister SA-Obergruppenführer
No revolution that seems to be permanent ... can lead to anything other than complete anarchy .
So the World will not live at war . So also the people do not live on revolution .
Nothing on this earth that has lasted for thousands of years ... was assembled in mere decades .
The largest tree also has the longest period of growth .
What braves the centuries ... will also be strong through the centuries .
Alfred Rosenberg , Reichsleiter and later Reich Minister for annexed Eastern Territories
It is our unshakeable belief in ourselves ... that is our hope for the youth ... to carry on the work which has been put before them in the stormy years ... of the revolt of 1918 in Munich ... and which is already part of the entire German nation 's history .
Dr. Otto Dietrich , Reichsleiter and Reich Press Chief in Ministry of People Enlightenment and Propaganda
Truth is the foundation ... on which the power of the press stands in the world .
And that it reports the truth about Germany ... is the only demand that we place on the foreign press .
Dr Fritz Todt , Reich General Inspector of Highways and Construction and Minister of Armaments and Munitions
As I speak , work on the Reich Autobahn has begun at 51 locations .
Although this work is in its early stage ... today there are already 52,000 men on the job ... and another 100,000 ... engaged in the work of allied industries .
Fritz Reinhardt , State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Finance and SA Obergruppenführer
Wherever we look , all around there is building ... and new creations ... and activity and life ... which will continue into the future .
Richard-Walther Darré , Reich Agricultural Leader , Head of Central Office of Race and Resettlement
Maintaining the health of our farmers is the primary foundation ... for the prosperity of industry ... for German business and for foreign exports .
Julius Streicher , Gauleiter of Upper Franconia and Editor of " Der Stürmer "
A people that does not protect the purity of its race , goes to seed !
Dr. Robert Ley , Reichsleiter and Head of the German Labor Front ( DAF
- Deutsche Arbeitsfront )
All our work must be dictated by a single thought ... that the German worker ... be made an upright , proud and equally entitled national comrade .
Dr. Hans Frank , Reichs Minister of Justice and later Governor General of occupied Poland
As the Leader of the German legal service ... I can say that , clearly , the basis of the National Socialist State ... is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code . And for us our highest leader is also the highest judge . !
We know how sacred the principles of these laws are to our Führer . These Reich laws can assure you , National Comrades ... that your life and existence is safe in this National Socialist State of Order , Freedom and Law .
Dr. Josef Goebbels , Reich Minister of People Enlightenment and Propaganda , Gauleiter of Berlin ... and later General Plenipotentiary for Total War
May the bright flame of our enthusiasm never be extinguished .
It alone gives light and warmth ... to the creative art of modern political propaganda .
This comes from the depths of the People ... and from these depths of the people ... it must always again find its roots and its strength .
It may be good to possess power based on strength ... but it is better to win and hold the heart of a People .
Konstantin Hierl , Reichsarbeitsführer , Head of the German Labor Service
Today , the German people are spiritually and soulfully ready ... to undertake their obligation in the general Labor Service .
We have the Führer 's orders !
Reich Labor Service Review before Hitler
My Leader :
I wish to present 52,000 RAD men for your inspection .
Hail , Men of the Labor Service !
Hail my Führer !
Shoulder spades !
Spades at ease !
Here we stand .
We are ready ... to carry Germany into a new era .
Germany !
Comrade , where do you come from ?
From Friesenland
And you , Comrade ?
From Bavaria
And you ?
From Kaiserstuhl
And you ?
From Pomerania
And from Königsberg
From Silesia
From the seacoast
From the Black Forest
From Dresden
From the Danube
From the Rhine
And from the Saar
One People !
One Leader !
One Reich !
Germany !
Today we work together ... in the swamp .
We work in the swamp .
And in the sand .
We dam the North Sea .
We plant trees .
We build roads ... from town to town , and city to city .
We provide the farmer with new soil ... forests and fields , land and bread ... for Germany .
We didn 't stand in the trenches . Nor were we under the shell fire of grenades ... and still we are soldiers .
Sharpen the hammers ... axes , pick axes and spades . !
We are the Reich 's young manhood . !
As once at Langemarck ... at Tannenberg ... before Lüttich ( Liege ) ... before Verdun ... on the Somme ... on the Ähne ... in Flanders ... in the West ... in the East ... in the South ... on land , on water , and in the clouds .
Comrades , who were shot by the Red Front and Reactionaries ...
You are not dead . !
You live in Germany . !
My Labor Service Men . For the first time you are presented for review in this forum ... before me and before the German people .
You represent a great idea ... and we know that for millions of our national comrades ... physical labor will not longer be a divisive concept . But it will instead bind us together and , furthermore ... no longer will it be the case in Germany ... that physical labor will be seen as anything less ... than any other work .
The whole nation passes through your school .
The time will come when no German ... can be admitted into the community of the people ... until he has first become a member of your group .
And you know that today you are not only being seen ... by the thousands in Nuremberg , but by all of Germany ... which also sees you here for the first time today .
And I know that just as you serve this Germany proudly ... all of Germany today will see its sons marching in you with proud joy !
Viktor Lutze , S.A. Chief of Staff at SA Night Rally
Hail Victory !
Hail Victory !
Hail Victory !
Comrades . Many of you here tonight knew me ... as an SA man ... marching in the rank and file ... in the first years of the Movement .
And Party Comrades , just as I was an SA man then ... so I am still an SA man today !
We SA workers will always be true only to the Führer ... and fight for the Führer .

According to your command , my Leader , a youth stands here ... a youth that knows neither class nor caste .
The young generation of our people follows after you .
Just as you demonstrate the highest self-sacrifice in this Nation ... so does this youth wish to be selfless .
Because you embody the concept of fidelity for us ... therefore we wish to be faithful .
Adolf Hitler , the Leader of German Youth , attention !
My German youth .
After one year I can greet you again here .
You standing here today represent something ... that is happening all over Germany .
And we want that you , German boys and girls ... will absorb everything that we wish for Germany .
We want to be one people ... and through you , to become this people .
We want a society with neither castes nor ranks . And you must not allow these ideas to grow within you .
We want to see one Reich . ! And you must educate yourselves for this .
We want this people to be obedient ... and you must practice obedience in yourselves .
We want this people to be peace-loving ... but at the same time to be courageous . And you must , for that reason , be both peace-loving ...
You must be both peace-loving and strong .
We want this people not to become soft ... but to become hard and , therefore ... you must steel yourselves for this in your youth .
You must learn sacrifice ... and also never to collapse .
Whatever we create today ... whatever we do ... will all pass away ... but in you Germany will live on .
And when we can no longer hold ... the flag that we tore from nothing ... you must hold it firmly in your fists !
And I know that it cannot be any other way ... as we bind ourselves together . For you are flesh of our flesh and blood from our blood . !
The same spirit that governs us ... burns in your young minds .
And when the great columns of the movement ... sweep through Germany today ... then I know that you will close ranks ... and we know that Germany lies in front of us ...
Germany marches within us ... and Germany follows behind us . !

Night Rally of Political Leaders
Architect Albert Speer 's " Sea of Flags " ... and " Cathedral of Lights " on Zeppelin Field .
Ayear ago ... we met for the first time on this field :
the first general review of political leaders ... of the National Socialist Party .
200,000 men have assembled here . They are not here at the summons of their hearts alone ... but also at the summons of their loyalty .
It was the great calamity of our people that drove us to the struggle ... brought us together ... and left us greater .
Those who do not understand ... have not experienced the same calamities among their people .
These things appear enigmatic and mysterious ... that hundreds of thousands would be led to assemble ... amidst calamity and passion .
Others cannot understand ... that this is not an order of the State . !
They are deceiving themselves . !
The State does not order us . ! We order the State . !
The State did not create us . ! Rather we created our own State . !
No , the movement lives ... and it is grounded hard and fast .
And as long as one of us can draw a breath ... he will give his strengths to the movement ... just as it was in yesteryear .
Then drum will join drum ... flag will join flag ... group will join group , Gau to Gau ... and after that , this earlier divided people ... will follow these sacred columns of the Nation .
It would be an outrage if we were to lose ... what we have fought for ... with so much labor , so much worry ... so much sacrifice , and so many privations .
One cannot live faithfully and give up ... what has given meaning and purpose to one 's entire life .
That would not be so ... if it were not a cardinal command .
And no earthly power gave us that command . For the God , our God , who created our people , gave us that command . !
So it is our vow this evening ... that each hour , on every day ... to think only of Germany of the People and Reich ... and of our German nation . !
To the German people . !
Hail Victory . ! Hail Victory . !
Review of SA and SS and Commemoration of the recent death on August 2 , 1934 ... of Reichspräsident and General Feldmarshall Paul von Hindenburg
Heinrich Himmler , Reichsführer-SS and Chief of the German Police , Hitler , and Viktor Lutze , Stabchef-SA
Viktor Lutze , Storm Troopers ( SA ) Chief of Staff
My Führer ( My Leader ) :
Just as we have always done our duty to you in the past ... so too in the future , we await your orders alone .
And we , Comrades , know only to obey ... the orders of our Führer ... and to prove that we have remained true to the Führer .
Our Führer , Adolf Hitler :
Hail Victory . !
Hail Victory . !
SA and SS men :
A few months ago ... a dark shadow cast itself across our Movement .
The SA and other institutions of the Party ... had nothing whatsoever to do with this shadow .
They who would believe that a rift has opened in the unity of the Movement ... deceive themselves .
It stands fast as this block here ... and nothing in Germany will break it .
And when anyone does harm to the spirit of my SA ... then the SA will not be harmed ... but those who do this harm ... will injure only themselves !
And only a fool or a known liar ... could think ... that I would ever disband an organization ... that took us so many years to build .
My Comrades ... we stand fast together for our Germany ... and we must stand fast together for this Germany .
And I hand to each of you the new insignia ... placing them with confidence ... in the hands that I see as the most trustworthy there are in Germany .
For in the past you have proven your loyalty to me a thousand times . In the time to come , it cannot and will not be any different .
And so I greet you as my old , faithful SA and SS men . !
Hail Victory . ! Hail . ! Hail . !
Hail . !

Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess at the Podium
The Führer speaks :
The Sixth Party Day of the Movement has come to and end .
What appeared like a show of political strength ... for millions of Germans outside of our ranks . For hundreds of thousands of fighters ... it was ultimately more .
The great personal and spiritual meeting ... of the old fighters and comrades in struggle .
And , perhaps , a cross section of you ... despite the forced civility of this review of our Party ... will return with courageous hearts to the days in which it was difficult to be a National Socialist .
When our Party consisted of only seven members ... it already had two principles .
First , it would be a Party with a true ideology .
And second , it would be , uncompromisingly ... the one and only power in Germany .
We had to remain in the minority , because we mobilized ... the most valuable elements of struggle and sacrifice in the Nation ... which have always been not in the majority , but rather in the minority .
And because these are the racially best of the German nation ... they can in the proudest self-esteem ... claim the leadership of the Reich and the people . The German people ... and subordinated itself to this leadership in ever-growing numbers !
The German people is happy ... in the knowledge that a constantly changing vision ... has been replaced by a fixed pole . ! Whoever feels that he is the carrier of the best blood ... and knowingly uses it to attain the leadership ... will never relinquish it !
Ludwig Müller , Reichsbischof ( Reich Bishop of the United German Evangelist Church )
There is always a part of the people who stand out as really active fighters ... and more is expected from them than from the millions of national comrades in the general population .
For them it is not simply enough to make the pledge : " I believe . ! "
Rather , the affirmation : " I fight . ! "
For all time to come the Party will be the source of political leadership for the German people .
It will in its teaching ... and was ultimately in its organization hard as steel ... malleable in its tactics and adaptable in its entirety : yet it will be a training school like a holy order for political leaders .
It must be shown , however , that all upstanding Germans become Nationalist Socialists . Only the best Nationalist Socialists , however , are Party Comrades . !
Once , our enemies worried us and persecuted us and , from time to time ... removed the lesser elements from the Movement for us .
Today we must examine ourselves and remove from our midst the elements that have become bad . And therefore , do not belong with us . !
It is our wish and will ... that this State and this Reich last for thousand years .
We can be happy to know that this future belongs entirely to us . !
When the older ones among us falter ... the youth will stiffen and remain until their bodies decay .
Only then , if we in the Party with our most obedient dedication ... become the highest embodiment of National Socialist thought and being ... then the Party will materialize ... into an eternal and indestructible pillar of the German people and Reich .
Then our glorious and laudable Army ... the old , proud , standard bearers of our people ... who are equally tradition minded ... will champion the Political Leadership and the Party . And then these two institutions will equally educate the German man ... and , therefore , strengthen and carry on their shoulders ... the German State , the German Reich . !
At this hour , tens of thousands of our Party Comrades are already leaving the City .
While many of them relive the meeting in their memories ... still others are already planning the next review .
And again the people come and go and they will be engrossed anew and happy ... and inspired , for the idea and the Movement live on in our people ... and with the Movement are symbol of eternity !
Long live the National Socialist Movement . !
Long live Germany . !
Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess at the Podium
The Party is Hitler . ! But Hitler is Germany , as Germany is Hitler . ! Hitler :
Hail Victory ! Hail Victory !

Well I 'd like to ...
Well it 's your funeral , come on then , there 's a bus .
- You don 't stay here always ? - No , I 've taken a furnished flat ...
I 'm only over here from Canada for a few months .
By the way , am I allowed to know your name ?
- Smith .
- All right .
Do you want to know more about me ?
What do you think I do for a living ?
- Actress ?
- Not in the way you mean .
- Chorus ?
- No .
- Sorry .
- I 'm a freelance .
Out for adventure , eh ?
This way ...
Sorry my sitting room 's all upset I 've had the decorators in .
- Wait until I find the switch . - Not yet .
Now .
Mr Hannay would you be so kind and turn that mirror face to the wall ?
You 'd be happier if there were curtains over those windows . - Yes .
- I 'm sorry .
Hello , there 's the telephone .
Just a minute .
Mr Hannay don 't answer the telephone .
Why not ?
Because I think it 's for me .
Please don 't answer .
Just as you say .
Won 't you sit down ? Thank you .
Would you please kick that footstool over to me ?
- You needed that .
- I did .
Thank you .
- I owe you an explanation .
- Don 't bother about me , I 'm nobody .
We cannot talk here .
All right .
Just a minute .
OK ?
- Cigarette ?
- No , thank you .
- Your friend again .
- Take no notice .
Would you think me very troublesome if I asked for something to eat ?
- I 've had nothing all day .
- Sure .
- Do you like haddock ?
- Yes please .
I suppose your name isn 't really Smith .
It depends on where I am .
You may call me Annabella .
Annabella Smith , a clergyman 's daughter I 'd say .
Hello , nervy .
Upset by those shots tonight ?
I fired those shots .
- You what ? - Yes .
To create a diversion .
I had to get away from the theatre quickly .
There were two men there who wanted to kill me .
You should be more careful in choosing your friends .
- No you don 't understand .
- You don 't make it easy .
Beautiful mysterious woman pursued by gunmen ... sounds like a spy story .
That 's exactly what it is .
Only I prefer the word agent better .
- Agent ?
For what country ?
- Any country that pays me .
- But what is your country .
- I have no country .
Born in a balloon . Well , we 'll let that go .
Now I suppose you 're over here to dig up some big state secret .
No I 'm here to save a secret from being dug up ... a very important secret for this country ... not because I love England but because it will pay me better .
You see a very brilliant agent of a certain foreign power ... is on the point of obtaining a secret vital to your air defence .
I tracked 2 of his men to that music hall .
Unfortunately they recognised me .
That 's why they 're after me now .
That was too bad .
Have you ever heard of a thing called persecution mania ?
- You don 't believe me ?
- Frankly , I don 't .
Go and look down into the street .
You win .
- Are they there ? - Yes .
I hoped I 'd shaken them off .
I 'm going to tell you something ... which is not very healthy to know , but now that they followed me here ...
- What do you mean ?
- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps ?
- No .
What 's that , a pub ?
Never mind .
But what you were laughing at just now is true .
These men will stick at nothing I 'm the only one who can stop them .
If they are not stopped , it 's only a matter of days , perhaps hours ... before the secret is out of the country .
Why don 't you phone the police ?
Because they wouldn 't believe me any more than you did .
And if they did , how long would it take to get them going ?
These men act quickly .
You don 't know how clever their chief is ...
- clever and ruthless .
- Who is he ?
What 's his name ?
He has a dozen names and can look like a hundred people .
But one thing he can 't disguise .
This part of his finger is missing .
So if ever you should meet a man with no top joint there ... - be very careful my friend .
- Thanks , I 'll make a note of it .
- Meanwhile , what are you going to do ?
- First , I 'll eat my haddock .
Then ... if you don 't turn me out into the street , have a good night 's rest .
You 're welcome to my bed I 'll get a shakedown on the couch .
Is there anything else I can get you ?
- A map of Scotland .
- Why Scotland ?
There 's a man in Scotland I must visit next if anything is to be done .
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland by any chance ?
Perhaps I 'll tell you tomorrow .
Clear out Hannay .
They 'll get you next .
What you were laughing at right now is true .
These men will stop at nothing .
There 's a man in Scotland I must visit next if anything is to be done .
It is only a matter of days . perhaps hours ... before the secret is out of the country .
The police would not believe me any more than you did .
I tell you these men act quickly ... quickly ... quickly .
Good morning sir .
You 're up bright and early this morning .

I 've been paying her a call ... and now I want to go home . - Does she ?
- Well what 's preventing you ?
- One of those men is her husband . - Now do you see ?
- Why didn 't you tell me before ?

That 's the Manse but the minister hasn 't got a motor car .
Are there no newcomers ?
- Aye , there 's an English professor .
- Professor ?
He lives at Alt Na Shallach , the other side of the Loch .
Would that be anywhere near that village ? - It would .
- Thanks .
I 'll try there .
You won 't try tonight , it 's 14 miles .
Do you think I could get a lift in that van ?
It 's bound the other way .
I guess you 're right .
Could you put me up for the night somehow ?
- Free ?
- No , I 'll pay .
- Aye . Can you eat a herring ?
- I could eat half a dozen right now .

You 'll be tired ?
I 'll say I am .
Out on the tramp looking for a job .
Sit down please , while I go on with our supper . Thank you .
- Have you been in these parts long ?
- No . I 'm from Glasgow .
- Did you ever see it ?
- No .
You should see Saughiehall street with all it 's fine shops ... and Argyle street on a Saturday night with the trams and the lights ... and the cinema palaces and the crowds ...
- And its Saturday night tonight .
- You don 't get those things here .
No .
Do you miss them ?
Sometimes .
I 've never been to Glasgow , but I 've been to Edinburgh , and London ...
I 'll tell you about London at supper .
- John wouldn 't approve of that .
- Why not ?
He says it 's best not to think of such places ... and the wickedness that goes on there .
Listen now before he comes back .
What do you want to know ?
Is it true that all the ladies paint their toenails ?
- Some of them .
- Do London ladies look beautiful ?
They do .
But they wouldn 't if you were beside them .
- You ought not to say that .
- What ought he not to say ?
I was just telling your wife that I prefer the town to the country .
God made the country .
Is the supper ready woman ?
- May I look at your paper ?
- I don 't mind .
- You didn 't tell me your name .
- Hammond .
Well Mr Hammond , if you 'll put down that paper , I 'll say a blessing .
Yes , of course .
Sanctify these bounteous mercies to us miserable sinners .
Oh lord make us truely thankful for all thy manifold blessings ... and continuously turn our hearts from wickedness ... and from worldly things unto thee ...
Amen .
I mind I forgot to lock the barn .
There are police cars coming .
You best be going .
- I was so asleep .
- Don 't let them catch you .
I 'll never forget you for this .
Which way do I go ?
I 'll show you .
Aye , I might have known ...
Making love behind my back ...
Get out .
And you too . Get out of my house before I ...
- Aye , go go .
- And leave you like this ?
- It 's your chance of liberty . - You don 't understand ...
You 're wrong . She 's only trying to help me .
- To bring shame upon the house .
- To help me to escape from the police .
- The police ?
- They 're after me for murder .
They 're here .
She came to warn me .
I told her about it last night .
Don 't let them in .
Say I 'm not here . I 'll make it worth your while .
How much ?
Have you got that much ?
Give it to me .
After they 've gone .
Get back into the bed . Shut him in .
Hide him .
- No not there . I don 't trust him .
- But he took the money .
He couldn 't resist it , here ...
I was right , he 's asking if there 's a reward if you get catched .
He 'll argue a moment before he lets them in .
Now 's your time .
Your jackets terrible light coloured I 'm afraid they 'll see you .
- You best take this one .
- Is this your husband 's coat ?
His Sunday best one . But never mind .
They mustn 't see you .
- What about you ?
- I 'll say I couldn 't stop you .
- He 'll not ill treat you ?
- He 'll pray at me .
But no more .
What 's your name ?
I 'll never forget you for this .
There he goes .
Spread out in a line .
- Is the master in ?
- What name shall I say sir ?
He wouldn 't know my name but ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith .
- Would you wait here while I enquire ?
- Yes all right .
There 's been a couple of cars here .
Murderers don 't pay calls in cars .
- Good day to you .
- Good day to you .
Have you seen any strangers about this morning ?
There 's a few callers upstairs now but they 're not strangers .
You haven 't seen any suspicious bodies outside the windows or at the house .
No sir .
There hasn 't been anybody near here for the last half hour .
- You 're from Annabella Smith ?
We 're having a few drinks to celebrate my daughter Hilary 's birthday .
Give me 5 minutes to get rid of these people and then we can talk . Come along and meet my wife .
Louisa , another guest .
This is Mr ... - I forgot to ask your name .
- Hammond . Mr Hammond .
He 's come to see me on business , all the way from London .
There 's a police inspector at the door . He wants to speak to you .
The door ?
All right , all right .
I 'll deal with this .
- Take him in my dear will you please .
- Come on ... This is Patricia ...
Mrs Bailley .
Hilary my dear this is Mr ...
Hammond , just arrived from London .
Forgive the orgy , we 've all been to church ... the sermon lasted 45 minutes .
This is Captain and Mrs Ogilvie .
Have a drink Mr Hammond ?
This is Derek , Derek Stewart ...
And this is Sheriff Watson .
You 've got to be polite to him .
He 's our Sheriff substitute . Scotch for a local beat .
Give you 6 months hard as soon as look at you .
It 's all right don 't worry .
I 've sent them away .
Come and look at the view from this window Mr Hammond .
We 're rather proud of it .
Sheriff , when are you going to catch that murderer ?
- What murderer ? - Haven 't you heard ?
The man who stuck a knife into that woman in Portland place .
- He 's in the district .
- How exciting , where ?
Somewhere about . On the moors , bridge of Orchy or somewhere .
Why don 't you catch him ?
You wouldn 't like me to be stuck in the back with a knife .
It 's not my business . You catch him and I 'll convict him .
- Is there a reward ? - Gracious , it 's nearly 1 o 'clock .
We must get out of here . The Professor wants his lunch .
There 's no hurry .
But if you must go .
Pat , ring for Captain Ogilvie 's car .
Whenever you catch him you 'll find me at the court at 10 every morning ... so bring him along .
Louisa , forgive us , Mr Hammond and I want to have a chat before lunch .
Now Mr. Hannay .
I suppose it 's safe to call you by your real name now .
- What about our friend Annabella ?
- She 's been murdered .
Murdered ?
The Portland Mansion affaire . What are they looking for you for ?
- I didn 't do it .
- Of course you didn 't .
But why come all this way to Scotland to tell me about it ?
I believe she was coming to see you about some Air Ministry secret .
She was killed by a foreign agent who was interested too .
- Did she tell you what he was like ? - There wasn 't time .
There was one thing , part of his little finger was missing .
- Which one ?
- This one , I think .
Sure it wasn 't this one ?
- Lunch is ready dear .
- I 'm coming right away .
Well , I 'm afraid I 'm guilty of leading you down the garden path ... or should it be up ?
I never can remember . It seems to be the wrong garden all right .
- What are we going to do about it ?
- That 's just the point .
What are we going to do about it ?
You see I live here as a respectable citizen and you must realise ... that my whole existence would be jeopardised if it became known ... that I am not , what shall we say , not what I seem .
Oh Mr Hannay , why have you come here ?
Why have you forced me into this difficult position ?
I can 't lock you up in a room .
I 've my wife and daughters to think of ...
I don 't know what to think , really I don 't ...
What makes it doubly important that I shouldn 't let you go is ... that I 'm just about to convey some vital information out of the country .
Oh yes , I 've got it . Poor Annabella would 've been too late in any case .
- Well , that 's that .
- Yes , well what about it ?
- What about what ?
- About yourself ...
- It seems there 's only one way out .
- And what 's that ?
Supposing I left you alone , with this revolver .
Tomorrow 's newspapers could announce that the Portland Place murderer ... - had taken his own life .
- I thought you were coming to lunch ... We 're all waiting .
Will Mr Hannay be staying ? I don 't think so dear .
Well , what do you think Mr Hannay ?
Well I 'm afraid you leave me no alternative .
I can 't find my hymn book .
Where did you leave it ?
In the breast pocket of my overcoat it was hanging here .
John , I 'm afraid I gave it to that gentleman who stayed here that night .
Cigarette cases yes , but I 've never seen it happen to a hymn book .
This bullet stuck among the hymns .
Well I 'm not surprised , Mr Hannay ... some of these hymns are terribly hard to get through .
I 'm not complaining Sheriff . " Hymns that have helped me " .
That 's a good one , Mr Hannay .
That 's fine . And to think I was drinking his champagne only half an hour before .
It 's a lesson to us all , not to mix with doubtful company on the Sabbath .
- How did you escape ?
- Look out the window and you 'll see .
They put ... They body in the dressing room .
When I came to I borrowed this suit and pinched his car .
Sheriff , I don 't want to hurry you , but oughtn 't we to be taking steps ?
This is serious you know . If not , you don 't think I 'd come to you ... - with a murder charge hanging over me .
- Never heed the murder Mr Hannay .
You 'll convince Scotland Yard of your innocence like you convinced me .
All I 'll need is a short statement I can forward to the proper authority .
I 've someone coming over from the police station to take it down .
- Are you waiting to see me Sheriff ?
- Indeed I am . Do you think I enjoy playing for time with a murderer ?
- Murderer ?
- Certainly . Hannay , you 're under arrest for wilful murder ... of a woman unknown in Portland Mansions , London , last Tuesday .
Take him over to the jail .
You must believe my story , it 's true every word .
We 're not so daft in Scotland as some smart Londoners think .
Do you think I believed your story about the Professor ?
He 's my best friend . Get me Professor Jordan .
Where did that bullet come from ?
From one of your pursuers on the moor .
Isn 't that so ? I had a shot at him myself .
Let me phone the High Commissioner for Canada in London .
You better do that from London . You 'll be there soon enough .
It 'll save you the cost of a trunk call .
That 's the Professor 's car all right .
Hannay must be inside spilling the beans .
- Stop him there !
- My God !
How do you do ?
We 're all waiting for you .
Pamela 's gone to meet you at the station .
... From our respected leader and standard bearer himself ...
I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you another question vital ... to the import of our country at this critical and momentous hour .
But first of all , as a preliminary to this , I shall occupy your time for ...
- You 've occupied too much already .
Ladies and Gentlemen , I will now call upon the speaker of the evening ...
Speak out ! There 's no need for me to tell you who he is or speak of his record ... as a soldier and statesman , a son of Scotland ...
- The border and conquered England ... one of the foremost figures of the diplomatic world in London .
I 'm therefore going to ask him to tell you something ... And about time too !
Important to this constituency that at this crucial by-election ... our candidate should be returned by an adequate majority .
I now ask for Captain Fraser .
Ladies and Gentlemen , I apologise for my hesitation in rising ... but to tell you the simple truth I 'd entirely failed ... while listening to the chairman 's flattering description ... to realise he was talking about me .
For you , may I say from the bottom of my heart with the upmost sincerely ... how delighted and relieved I am to find myself in your presence here .
Delighted because of your friendly reception , relieved because ... as long , as I stand on this platform ...
I 'm delivered from the anxieties ... which must always be the lot of a man in my position .
When I journeyed up to Scotland a few days ago on the Highland Express ... over that magnificent structure , the Fourth Bridge ... that monument to Scottish engineering and Scottish muscle ... on that journey I had no idea that in a few days I would find myself ... addressing an important political meeting , no idea ...
I 'd planned a very different programme for myself .
You 'd be for the moors to shoot something .
Yes , or somebody , I 'm a rotten shot .
Anyhow I little thought that I should be speaking tonight in support of ... that brilliant young statesman , that rising , the gentleman on my right .
Already known as one destined to make his mark in politics .
Your future Member of Parliament , your candidate , Mr ...
- McCrocodile .
- He doesn 't know the candidate 's name .
I know your candidate will forgive my referring to him ... by the friendly nickname by which he 's already known in anticipation ... in anticipation , mark you ...
Westminster . Now ladies and gentlemen , we 'll discuss some topic .
What shall it be ?
- The herring fisheries .
- Unemployment . - What about the idle rich ?
- The idle rich ?
That 's an old fashioned topic , especially for me . I 'm not rich ... and I 've never been idle .
I 've been very busy all my life ...
- and expect to be much busier soon .
- Have you ever worked with your hands ?
Indeed I have , and I 've known what it is to feel lonely and helpless ... and to have the whole world against me ... and those are things that no man or woman ought to feel .
I ask your candidate and all those who love their fellow men ... to set themselves resolutely to make the world a happier place ... a world where no nation plots against nation ... no neighbour plots against neighbour ... where there is no persecution or hunting down ... where everyone gets a square deal and a sporting chance ... and where people try to help and not to hinder ... a world where suspicion and cruelty and fear have been forever banished !
That 's the sort of world I want .
That 's all I have to say , goodnight .
- I did what I could for you .
- You 're a difficult man to follow .
- I guess you think you 've been clever .
- Tell your prisoner not to insult me .
- You try and stop me . - Come along . Couldn 't you realise I was telling the truth in that train ?
You must 've seen I was genuine .
Whether you believe me or not ... put a telephone call through to the High Commissioner for Canada ... and tell him that an enormously important secret ...
An important secret is being taken out of the country by a foreign agent . I can 't do it myself because of this fool detective .
Has that penetrated ?
Right to the funny bone , now tell me another one .
Haven 't you any sense at all ? Put that call through ...
I beg you refer them to me .
Will you do this ?
No .
Goodnight . I beg pardon Miss but we should like you to come too .
- Whatever for ? - To identify the prisoner formally . Will you come to the police station ?
It 's only for a few minutes . All right , if it 's absolutely necessary , lets get it over .
Now you ...
- Must I sit next to this man ? - It 's just a moment .
Well , be as quick as you can .
Isn 't that the police station ?
You past it .
You must 've misunderstood me .
We 're going somewhere else .
- Where are we going ?
- To Inverary .
- Inverary ? - Yes .
This man is to be questioned by the Sheriff Principal .
- We 've orders to take him there .
- But not to take me .
I 'm afraid you must go . You 'll be sent back at the earliest moment .
- How far is it to Inverary ?
- Forty miles .
Will you keep quiet ? We 'll be there in less than 2 hours .
I 'm not going to spend the night with you all . Looks like it .
Isn 't he going the wrong way ?
That 's the way to Inverary . There 's a bridge down on that road .
We have to go round .
- Might I see your warrant ?
- You shut your mouth . You 'll see it soon enough when we get to the station .
Like to have a small bet with me Pamela ?
All right I 'll have it with you Sherlock .
A hundred to one that ... your Sheriff Principal has the top joint of his little finger missing .
I win .
Hello .
What are we stopping for ?
They 're all over the road , get out there and clear them away .
- What about him ?
- I 'll soon fix that .
There miss , now you 're a special constable .
- What 's the idea ? What do you mean ?
Yes , and as long as I go , you go .
Come on ! Stop them !
- Come on , we must run for it .
See if they 've gone down that way .
Where the devil can they have gone ?
Help ! Let me go , let me go !
Shut up or I 'll shoot you first and myself after .
There 's nobody down here I tell you .
Then come up here , don 't waste any more time .
They must be a mile away by now .
Don 't do that .
Oh do stop whistling .
Why are you doing this ?
What chance have you got tied to me ?
Keep that question for your husband .
I admit you 're a white man 's burden . I know and I can 't tell you what comfort that gives me .
What is the use ?
Those policemen will get you as soon as it 's daylight .
- They 're not policemen .
- When did you find out ?
You did it yourself .
I didn 't known that was the wrong road to Inverary .
They were taking us to their boss , God help us if they ever catch us . I see , you 're still sticking to your penny novelette spy story .
Of the 20 million women in this Island I 've got to be chained to you .
Listen , I 'm telling you the truth . I told you on the train ... and after that election meeting .
I 'm telling you now for the third time .
There 's a dangerous conspiracy and we 're the only people who can stop it .
Think what you 've seen happen right here under your very nose .
- The gallant knight to the rescue .
- All right .
Then I 'm just a plain common murderer ... who stabbed an innocent defenceless woman in the back ... how do you come out of that ?
I don 't know how innocent you may be ... but you 're a woman , defenceless and alone on a desolate moor in the dark .
Manacled to a murderer who 'd stop at nothing to get you off his hands . If that 's the situation you prefer , have it my lovely , and welcome .
I 'm not afraid of ...
For all you know I may murder a woman a week .
So listen to a bit of advice .
From now on , do every single thing I tell you to do , and do it quick .
- You big bully !
- I like your pluck .
We 're going in there .
That 's my business .
Now remember what I said , the civil tongue , or else ... We 're going in there and you will back me up in everything I say or do .
- Has that penetrated the ivory dome ?
- Only just . Pull yourself together now .
Put your hand in my pocket ... and look as if you 're in a hurry .
Come in man , come in sir .
Oh the young lady 's terribly wet .
Yes , we had an accident with our car a few miles back .
- Oh , you 'll be staying the night ? - Yes .
We 've just the one room left with the one bed in it .
You 'll not mind that ?
No , quite the reverse .
- You 're man and wife I suppose ?
- Oh yes . - Yes .
- Have you any luggage ?
No , we left that behind in the car .
Well maybe I could lend the young lady a nightgown .
Will you please register ?
James , the book . I 'll away up and light a fire .
Will you be needing your supper ? No , thank you .
Just send up a large whisky and soda and a few sandwiches .
Oh , and a glass of milk .
I can 't write with my left hand my dear but I can shoot with it .
You can guess what 's in this pocket . You sign , the sooner you get used to writing your new name , the better .
Off we go , Mr and Mrs Henry Hopkinson The Hollyhocks , Hammersmith .
Now dearie , off with that wet skirt , I 'll have it dried in the kitchen .
Oh don 't bother . It 'll dry in front of the fire just the same .
No doubt the gentleman will take care of you .
Good night sir .
- Good night man .
Good night .
- Is he married to her do you think ?
- I don 't know and I don 't care .
They 're so terribly in love with each other .
I 'm going to tell them the whole story .
You want to hang me for a murder I didn 't commit ?
So long as they hang you . Let me go !
I 'm not going to spend the night here ?
Of course you are , what else can you do ?
We were just getting warm before the fire .
I can see that .
I thought maybe you 'd like this in your bed , sir . Thank you .
You 'd like a hot water bottle my sweet ?
- Say " Yes darling " .
- Yes darling .
- Very well .
- Please don 't go !
Why not ?
Is anything wrong ?
Of course not , she wants to tell you something that 's all .
We 're a runaway couple .
I knew it all the time , and they 're after you ? You won 't give us away will you ?
Please .
Of course we will not give you up .
Good night to you both .
You 'll not be disturbed .
Thank God for a bite to eat .
- What 's next on the programme ?
- Get these things off . Right .
How are we going to set about it ?
Anything in that bag of yours ?
A pair of scissors or hairpin or something ?
A nail file if you think that 'd help .
It 'll take about 10 years but we can try .
Now let 's make ourselves as comfortable as possible .
What about that skirt of yours ?
It 's still pretty damp you know . Don 't want to be tied to a pneumonia case on top of everything else .
- Take it off , I don 't mind .
- I 'll keep it on , thank you .
And that , is that .
My shoes and stockings are soaked . I 'll take them off .
That 's the first sensible thing I 've heard you say .
- Can I be of any assistance ?
- Here hold this .
- Thank you . - Don 't mention it .
- Would you like your milk now ?
I 'll wait a little .
That 's better .
Now are your feet quite warm again ?
Will you kindly place yourself on the operating table ?
Nobody 's going to hurt you .
This is Armistice day . - Lets get some rest .
- I 'm not going to lie on this bed . You 're chained to me , you 'll lie wherever I lie ...
- we 're the Siamese twins .
- Don 't gloat ! You think I 'm looking forward to waking up and seeing your face ?
Unwashed and shiny ?
What a sight you 'll be .
Give me that nail file . Lets have a go at this .
I wish I could get that damned tune out of my head ...
I wonder where I heard it .
- You sound very sleepy .
- Sleepy ! I 'll say so .
Do you know when I last slept in a bed ? Saturday night .
Then I only got a couple of hours .
- What made you wake ?
Dreams ? - What do you mean ?
They say murderers have terrible dreams .
Only at first . Got over that a long time ago ... when I first took to crime I was quite squeamish about it .
- I was a sensitive child .
- You surprise me . Used to wake up in night screaming thinking the police were after me ... but one gets hardened .
How did you start ?
In quite a small way , pilfering from other children at school .
Then a little pocket picking , car pinching , smash and grab ... and so on , to plain burglary .
In years to come you can take your grandchildren to Madame Tussaud 's ...
- and point me out .
- Which section ?
It 's early to say , I 'm still young . I 'll be in one department or another .
Yes , you 'll point me out and say : " Chicks , if I told you how matey ...
I once was with that gentleman , you 'd be surprised " .
What 's the matter ?
You 're pinching my wrist with this handcuff .
Sorry . Talking about Madame Tussaud 's .
That 's how it all began .
- What began ?
- My career of crime ... all hereditary , Great Uncle Penruddock .
Who was he ? Where were you brought up ?
Never heard of my great uncle Penruddock ... the Cornish Bluebeard ?
Got it all from him .
I thought your family came from Canada .
No that 's where they went after the Penruddock incident .
Murdered 3 wives and got away with it but his third mother-in-law ... got the goods on him and tried to have him arrested .
Did she succeed ?
No . He was too quick for her . Took her for a walk to Land 's End and shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean .
He 's in Madame Tussaud 's and there 's no doubt about his department .
You must go down to see him sometime .
Can 't mistake him ...
Third on the left as you go in , red whiskers and a hair lip .
And that lady , is the sad story of my life ... poor orphan boy , who never had a chance ... are you still set on giving me up to the police ?
You 're sure everything 's going to be quite all right ?
Bound to be .
He can 't have much time . As soon as I 've picked up ... You know what , I 'll clear out of the country .
Be careful .
- Good bye my dear .
Is that Professor Jordan 's house ?
Oh , he 's gone to London .
I 'd like that whiskey hot .
I 'll get the hot water .
He dodged down a side street . The police took the wrong way .
The girl handed him over to us thinking we were detectives .
Very good ma 'am , I see .
- Well ? - The old man 's got the wind up .
- He 's cleared out already .
- Whatever for ?
Thought it too dangerous with Hannay on the loose ... he 's warning the whole 39 steps .
Has he got the , you know ? Yes . He 's picking up our friend at the London Palladium on the way out .
Here 's your toddy .
That 'll be half a crown . - And the phone call .
- We 'll say a shilling .
- Is this a hotel as well ?
- Aye .
- Do you have people staying here ?
- Aye . I suppose you get a few odd people at this time of the year ?
Oh , aye .
You didn 't happen to have anyone in tonight , did you ?
Aye . They weren 't by any chance a young couple , were they ?
James ! Mercy me !
What kind of a silly creature am I married to ?
Want to get us all jailed ?
How much did you take for these ?
Half a crown .
Out the pair of you .
Don 't let on that you got a drink here after hours .
You old fool you .
You wouldn 't have given away a young couple .
Good morning .
What 's the idea ?
How did we get out of these ? I slipped out of mine last night ... and camped out here . You didn 't .
- Why didn 't you run away ?
- I did , but as I was going ...
I discovered you 've been speaking the truth so I decided to stay .
What earthquake caused your brain to work at last ?
I overheard those men telephoning .
- What did they say ?
- A lot of stuff about the 39 steps .
Go on .
Someone 's going to warn them .
How can you warn steps ? Go on .
There was another thing , someone 's got scared and is clearing out and ...
Oh yes , he 's picking up someone at the London Palladium .
The London Palladium ?
Is that the Professor ?
Our friend with the little finger missing .
I feel such a fool , not having believed you .
Oh that 's all right . We ought to get a move on .
What room are those 2 men in ?
No room .
They went as soon as they had telephoned .
They what ?
- Didn 't I tell you ?
- You let them go ?
- You little idiot !
- Don 't talk to me like that .
4 or 5 precious hours wasted . Why didn 't you wake me up ?
You should 've realised what they said was important .
They 've called these men off why not let well alone ? Let well alone ?
My good girl , I 'm accused of murder .
The only way I can clear myself is to expose these spies .
You still can .
He 's going to the London Palladium . First or second house ?
I 'll get there 5 hours late .
- The show should just about suit you !
- What 's that ?
You 're quite right madam .
The Air Ministry has a new thing lots of people are interested in ... but they are positive that no papers are missing about it ... that would be of any use to a spy .
I 'm quite sure . There 's a man leaving the country tonight with something .
Since you phoned from Scotland this morning we 've made enquiries .
- It 's obvious I 'm wasting my time .
- Just a moment please .
There 's one thing you haven 't told us . Where 's Richard Hannay ?
I haven 't the faintest idea .
- Now look here , you can 't ...
- You 're in the phone book , aren 't you ?
Well if anything crops up we 'll give you a ring .
That 's all now . Thank you .
Tell Archer and Seagrave to get another taxi and follow that girl .
She 'll lead us to Hannay alright .
Cover every exit and on no account let anyone leave the building .
You 2 go in the orchestra pit .
Ladies and gentlemen . We shall now sing .
No one 's allowed to leave the theatre .
Can 't a man go out and get a drink ?
My seat 's in the stalls . I 'm looking for someone .
May I go through ?
She 's seen him .
She 's on her way down to the stalls now sir .
Can I borrow your opera glasses ?
Can I take your place please ? What are you doing here ?
Listen , he 's in that box .
You can 't do anything , I 've been to Scotland Yard . Nothing 's been stolen from the Air Ministry .
But you heard those men and there he is .
Shall we take him now sir , or wait until the interval ?
What are you going to do ? Nothing 's taken and that 's the end .
Do you hear that tune ? The damned tune I couldn 't get out of my head .
Now I know where I heard it before .
That music hall , Annabella Smith .
Ladies and gentlemen ... with your kind attention and permission ...
I have now the honour to present to you ... one of the most remarkable men in the world .
- The same little man .
- Every day ... he commits to memory 50 new facts and remembers every one .
Facts from history , geography , from newspapers and scientific textbooks .
Millions and millions of them , down to the smallest detail .
Test him ladies and gentlemen .
Ask him any question ...
I 've got it .
Of course there are no papers missing .
All the information is inside Memory 's head .
- But I still don 't understand . - Don 't you see ?
The details of that Air Ministry secret were borrowed and memorised by ... and then replaced before anyone could find out .
That 's why he 's here tonight ... to take Memory out of the country after the show .
Some gentlemen here would like to speak to you .
A question please , a question please .
- When did Florence Nightingale die ?
- There 's something you must know .
- OK , Hannay . Come quietly .
You don 't want to cause trouble and spoil people 's entertainment . What are the 39 Steps ?
Come on , answer that .
What are the 39 Steps ?
The 39 Steps is an organisation of Spies ... collecting information for ...
Keep your seats . Keep your seats , please .
There 's no need for alarm .
I don 't want a chair .
Let me rest here .
I 'm alright .
Take it easy .
Get the girls on straight away .
The girl 's introduction right away .
What was the secret formula you were taking out of the country ?
Will it be alright me telling you ?
It was a big job to learn it .
The biggest job I ever tackled and I don 't want to throw it all away .
It will be quite all right .
The first feature of the new engine is its ratio of compression ... represented by R minus one over R to the power of Gamma .
Gamma seen in end-elevation , axis of the 2 lines of cylinders ... angle of 65 degrees .
Dimensions of cylinders as follows .
This device renders the engine completely silent .
- Am I right , sir ?
- Quite right old chap .
Thank you sir . Thank you .
I 'm glad it 's off my mind at last .
I told you not to drink so much .
One dance , mister .
Just one dance !
Jacqueline , stop bothering the gentleman .
- He 's not nice !
- How about a drink ?
It 's blood !
It 's blood !
Come in .
Excuse-me .
It 's the police .
The officer wants to see your passport .
- What does he want ?
- It 's just a formality .
You must go to the station . I said you 'd go today .
Ah , yes . Si ...
Thank you .
Crime on Rue Saint-Vincent .
- This guy is repulsive !
- Scram !
- French ?
- Yes , but quietly .
Countrymen , finally !
We wouldn 't say no , but get rid of those two !
Go on , scram !
You 're new .
Like anywhere else , women aren 't the only ones on the game here .
- I 'm Pierre .
- Siméon .
- And I 'm Gorlier .
- Hello .
- You 're here on business ?
- No .
I just came from Berlin .
- Cigarette ?
- Caporal !
Great !
- You can find them in Germany ?
- I bought them at the border .
You can trust us . We 're men .
I can see that !
Anisette !
- Same here . - Make it three !
Word of advice : be careful in Barcelona .
- It 's full of snitches of every stripe . - Really ?
And you can 't find a decent steak .
Oh , I 'm used to it .
Berlin 's even worse .
You don 't know hunger until you 've lived in Barcelona .
- You can 't let yourself slide here .
- Well , we 'll see .
Say ... Do you know a place where I can bed down for a while ?
Why not here ?
The manager is an ex-con .
His old lady does the cooking .
No danger of food poisoning . That 's very important in Spain .
- I 'll go ask him .
- OK .
Go ahead .
- He 's a good guy . - Him ?
Oh ...
Room and board : 220 pesetas a month .
Great .
I 'll take care of it right away .
There 's no hurry .
You have plenty of time .
Hey , you never know , mate . This way , the deal is done .
What the hell did I do with my wallet ?
... Wow !
You lost it ?
Come on , give it back right now .
What do you mean ?
What bad manners !
Skip the jive .
I get it . Give it back .
Be square . It 's all the dough I have left . And what about my papers ?
- He 's got some nerve !
- I 've got nerve !
? Let 's step outside !
Let 's clear this up with the police .
What ?
No cops ! Never mind .
Take a seat !
You say you were robbed and you 're afraid of the police !
Okay , we 'll meet again !
- He 's going to ... - Throw me out if I don 't pay for my room .
- You understand Spanish ?
- Not , just the situation .
- How much can you pay ?
- I haven 't eaten in two days .
- He says ... - That he 's going to seize my dirty shirts and my toothbrush .
Let him .
I hope he makes good use of them .
Republic of Spain . " ... former Spanish and foreign soldiers to rejoin ... " Foreign Legion .
Not doing well ?
- So you 're hungry !
Come and eat .
- No , what an idea !
Come this way .
Go on , eat ! Eat !
Don 't mind them .
Here , lick it !
Lick , you scum !
Here , you scum ! Lick it !
I 'll kill anyone who comes close .
Join the glorious Spanish Foreign Legion .
You will find in the grand setting of Morocco
Honor and Profit - - 5 Pesetas a day .
No papers required .
No forms to fill .
- You 're French ?
- Yes .
[ Speaks Spanish . ] Why do you want to enlist ?
- I 'm famished .
- How 's that ?
- I 'm hungry . I have no job .
- Ah yes .
- You 're strong . - I guess ...
- What ?
- Do you have your papers ?
- No .
- It doesn 't matter .
Your name ?
- Er ...
Benoît .
- Benoît .
- What ?
- It 's a popular name with the French .
- Would you mind another name ? - I don 't care .
Makes no difference .
Then ?
Well , er ... Write down Gilieth .
Pierre Gilieth .
G , I , L , I , E , T , H.
Sign here . You 're in .
- Merde !
- You 're French ?
Mulot Marcel .
Paris , Rue 3 Frères .
And you ?
- Pierre Gilieth .
- Did they take you ?
- Yes , I got the stamp from the vet .
- Me too .
This is lousy .
- What 's forcing you ?
- I was starving .
Here , check out my shoes !
And they 're called Oxfords !
Just three months ago , I was still a bagpiper with the 3rd regiment in Algeria .
I 've never liked soldiers .
One day , I got fed up and I took a powder .
I made it to Spain , fat as a bicycle .
I really had to tighten my belt . So we 're going back to the desert . And we 're better paid on this side .
Yes , 5 pesetas .
And a pal .
So what was that German on about ?
They probably turned him down .
You should see the girlie who came in after me . They 'll never let him near those 5 pesetas .
Oh , here he is !
- You have a smoke ?
- I wish !
- If I may .
- Hey , another one !
- French ?
- Yes .
Thank you .
- Here , thanks .
- No , keep it !
- No , what an idea ! - Keep it .
We 're here for five years .
- No kidding ?
- They took you ?
- As you can see !
- But your guns are kind of empty !
Don 't worry about that .
We should celebrate !
- Maybe , but I 'm flat broke .
- I have money .
What !
?
You have the means to drink and smoke , and you join up like an idiot ?
- I can explain .
- No questions asked .
The rule here is to keep our memories to ourselves .
Right . We wipe the slate clean and start over from scratch .
- You were a soldier ?
- Yes , deserter .
- You desert ... ?
- Hey , come on , guys , how about this drink ?
Let 's go tie one on .
Hey you ! Don 't leave . Here are your marching orders .
You take the boat in Algeciras .
Don 't look , guys , but here we go again .
I go through life backwards .
- Like a crawfish ...
- Still , the important thing is to eat .
Yes , but after eight days of full meals , we forget we 've ever been hungry .
We 'll see .
Back when I was in the colonial army ...
Ah , you were in the colonial army ?
You 're wasting your time .
In the Legion , buddy , you must always look forward .
A guy in the 4th regiment at Marrakech gave me that advice . His name was ...
Hey , his name was the same as mine . What a coincidence !
What 's this monastery ?
That , my friends , is an image you won 't soon be forgetting .
It 's the Legion camp where you 'll be living .
- It 's got character .
- No talking in the ranks .
Forward , left .
- Do you have a preference ?
- Then , take the corner .
- OK .
- Smells like spring in a garbage dump , no ?
- Yeah , a rotten spring .
Oh , man !
We have a nice setup here .
Hey , fancy sheets !
- We could make you a veil .
- Well dressed , housed and fed ...
- We only need a secretary to take a letter .
- It 's still a strange way to live .
You , my little bourgeois , you 'll be used to it in one year , and you 'll re-up in 5 .
Listen to this soldier 's advice , and pass me a smoke .
Who the hell 's this guy ?
Hey , what ... ?
Do you have a stuffed nose , or are just afraid of drafts ?
The gentleman must think he 's at the movies .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7, 8 , 9 , 10 ...
Bravo , mate , you 're a real man ! Wait .
Let 's put him over here .
- We 'll take care of him .
- Allow me !
- Goodnight , sweetie . - [ Speaks Spanish . ]
Come on , play another tune !
The gentleman wants his nanny .
This is sure going to be fun .
My mattress is like an ironing board .
I don 't like soldiers .
Oh , shut it .
This isn 't so bad .
There . This is the Seine . A real ribbon .
The Seine turns , comes and then leaves again .
But not right away .
She knows that when you 're in Paris , you have to stay as long as possible .
This is Montmartre . Streets that climb , lovely girls , and accordion music ...
And there , a kid by the name of Mulot .
Yours truly .
- A kiss to get by !
- Down with the paws !
- Give me a kiss .
- You disgust me !
Hands off .
I know someone you don 't put up as much of a fuss with .
Is your dad coming back from his trip soon ?
Will you introduce me then ?
He 's having his nap .
Just wait ' til he 's here .
Ah , here comes your beau !
- Hi , guys !
- Hi .
- A drink ?
- I 'm broke .
No problem , I 'm buying .
- Does your mother print money ?
- Perhaps !
Oh , I almost left out Rue 3 Frères !
Hey , don 't touch Montmartre , you ruffian !
Do you realize not one of them understands what you 're saying ?
I don 't care .
They 're impressed and I 'm amused .
- You 're a big kid !
- Come on , I 'm buying a round .
So we 're playing nice now !
- Whenever you keep your hands to yourself .
- He was hassling you again ?
When you 're born a pig , you stay a pig .
- Let me know if he bothers you again .
- Oh , I 'm not scared of him .
- Where 's the wine ?
- Cooling .
The boss will serve you today .
Hurry it up , then !
- Hello , gentlemen .
- Greetings .
- Comes to 5 pesetas .
Who 's paying ?
- " Who 's paying ? " I am .
Light of my life !
Show me you 're not still mad at me !
No !
Leave it !
I 'm not trying to rip you off !
- I told you not to touch it !
He 's lost it !
It 's love letters , letters from a woman .
I don 't want anyone touching them .
- I don 't care about your woman .
- You know that the past is sacred .
Come on ...
How would you like folks to rifle through your papers , to dig into your past ?
- I have no past .
- We all have a past .
- You , like everyone else .
That 's life .
- What ?
- You want me to smash your face ?
- Oh , come on !
Say , doesn 't all his money amaze you ?
- It 's his mother 's .
- His mother , that 's easy to say .
What about the fuss he just made over his papers ?
In the middle , there was an ID card with a photo in the corner .
Oh , maybe it 's just a driver 's license .
- In any case , it had a funny color .
- You only need to ask him about it .
Then you just pound him into submission if he puts up a fight .
Oh no , it 's not time yet .
I 'd rather use a soft touch to find out what he 's hiding .
I don 't want him looking into my business . But if he insists , I 'll set him straight .
Don 't worry .
I 'll wait for the right opportunity .
Time doesn 't exist here .
So ...
Still , I 'd really like to know what that card is .
He keeps his papers in his jacket and his jacket on his bed ...
Looking for something , Gilieth ?
Oh , it 's you !
What ...
- I got the wrong bed , sorry .
I can 't see .
- Sure ...
Drills , forced marches ...
That 's all they have us doing .
Makes you want to check out of here .
Oh , you 're always bellyaching .
I didn 't sign up to play the fool .
I 'm not going downstairs .
I 'll just wait for chow time .
You 're right .
I 'm bushed too .
Oh , on second thought ...
There . A trick I learned from my aunt .
Never fails .
Mysterious Crime on Rue Saint-Vincent A man was found murdered in his home .
The motives remain unknown ...
M. Morin 's family has offered a reward of 50,000 francs for information leading to the capture of the murderer .
So , I hear you 're headed south .
- You read that in the cards ?
- The guy in the telegraph office told me .
The order came through this morning .
The 4th bandera is going to relieve the 2nd
- out of a nasty spot in the desert .
- I 'm not affected . I 'm in the 3rd .
- Lucky you .
- You think so ?
I 'd like to get out of here .
The air around here isn 't good for my lungs .
- So , your feet don 't hurt anymore ?
- No , I must have bound them too tightly .
Come on , let 's go down to the tavern .
The boss just got some first-rate wine !
- Get off my back .
- He also has real Pernod .
- I said , get off my back .
- Hey , what have I done ?
Don 't be nasty .
We 're brothers .
We enlisted together .
Don 't you remember the Barcelona barracks ?
Or the first meal we had together ?
We weren 't proud then .
You 're nagging me !
How do you like it ?
- Oh , it 's no Beaujolais .
- The third glass is always the best .
Here .
Hey grease ball , shut it down .
You 're going to make us bawl .
Oh , don 't cry .
You 'll rust the player .
They 're bugging me with their flamenco , their fandango and their cheap romance !
Gilieth !
They have French records !
You 're also being a pain with your music .
- You must be reminded of bad moments .
- I 'm reminded of nothing at all .
- Mind your own beeswax .
- Let 's drink to that .
I have something you 're going to like .
Rosita , the old bottle . Tell me what you think .
Painful memories need to be drowned .
Some of them know how to swim !
What 's the idea ?
- What 's the matter with you ?
- Stay out of it .
Come on , don 't worry .
We know what it 's like to have the blues .
You remind me of a soldier who came here because of ... Because of something stupid .
That was his secret .
Get it ?
He kept it deep inside , but it ate away at him .
One morning , it weighed so heavily on his mind that he went straight to the police and spilled his guts like an idiot .
- It was too much for one man to bear .
- Why are you telling me all this ?
It 's to remind you that you must always trust your friends .
If that guy had talked to his friends , he wouldn 't have messed up .
What do I care about your story ?
Don 't get mad .
It 's just a story .
It 's of no importance .
And I knew a guy who was always bugging people with question after question . And one day , he was found with a knife stuck in his belly .
- You 're saying this for my benefit ?
No , it 's just a story .
It 's of no importance .
Leave it . He 's over there , it 's about to start ...
He 's being a real pain !
Under Paris bridges
When night falls
All types of bums sneak around and find a berth ...
I don 't want to hear this !
It 's just as good as anything else . You can 't see clearly ...
- I said , don 't want to hear this !
- Oh , it 's nothing .
Will you stop this ?
To go to Suresnes Or to Charenton All along the Seine We walk ...
Shut up , or I 'll deck you !
What 's wrong with him ?
He must be soft in the head !
You planned this !
You 're rotten !
I 'll cut out your heart , you hear me ?
Get out of my way !
Clear out !
Where the hell is he ?
Go on , scram !
I 'll calm him down .
Go get some help at the camp .
- Gilieth , are you crazy ?
- I can 't stand that pig anymore ! I can 't !
So you 're the famous Gilieth .
You asked to speak to me ?
- Yes sir , captain !
- What is it ?
I 'm not doing well , sir .
Explain yourself .
Sir , I no longer wish to stay with the 3rd bandera . There 's a guy ... er ... Sorry , an individual who ...
Er ... I don 't know ... I think I 'm a pretty good legionnaire .
And I have the right to that pea ...
You have the right to obey and to maintain the discipline you chose to accept .
- I always do my duty , sir . - I know .
You 're a good soldier .
Yesterday , I took care of the guy who 's been riding me .
- I know that , too .
Is it serious ?
- I 'd trade my hide for his .
I don 't like that kind of answer .
You 're beginning to annoy me with these stories .
You don 't get to choose your place here ! You don 't get to discuss your assignment . Stop bothering me with your personal interests .
Sir , please transfer me to the 4th bandera so I can leave with them for the south .
It is the 3rd bandera , yours , which is leaving .
Ah ?
Well ... Then I ask that legionnaire Lucas be assigned to a different company .
Is that all ?
You brawled yesterday like a common porter .
That does not incline me to grant favors to legionnaires who get drunk , who slaughter each other like pigs .
Like the pigs you all are with your big mouths , and those damn pasts I don 't wish to know .
If we had to account for the pasts of everyone in the Legion , we 'd be better off dissolving it .
Oh ... We are not all born equal before Fortune .
So if I have to die just to die , I 'd rather die
- with honor .
- How long have you known that saying ?
Since I know that I 'm leaving for the south .
Legionnaire Lucas will be reassigned .
He will not leave .
May God grant you your wish .
- Sir ! Thank you , sir .
- Don 't thank me .
Listen , legionnaire !
When you feel your past clutching you by the throat ,
- ask He who can ...
- I don 't believe in God , sir .
Ah ...
Then , here .
Thank you , sir .
Do you know what I 'm thinking ?
Don 't you care what I 'm thinking ? I 'll tell you anyway .
I 'm thinking about crosswalks , the crosswalks in the streets of Paris .
Oh , I 've never used one .
One must have some dignity !
Well , here , now , they seem swell to me .
It 's funny , no ?
Are you mad at me because I 'm telling you about crosswalks ?
No , buddy , I 'm not mad at you . On the contrary .
No , I feel good .
As good as it gets .
You can breathe easy . Lucas won 't be making you miserable .
Why do you think Lucas makes me miserable ?
Only the blind can 't see .
You 're right .
Really , if I 'm here ... - No questions asked .
- I have a serious reason .
No questions asked . You 're my friend , and that 's enough .
Oh , if you knew how it happened .
Don 't bother .
You must have had your reasons .
Anyway , things will be nice and quiet in the desert . No more Fernando Lucas and his smart ass mug .
- How long did you enlist for ?
- 5 years .
You don 't mess around , do you ?
If you still have the heart for it , you can join the military police after .
You look like two fools .
- Yes , my little whore .
- It 's true we look like two idiots .
But that 's because we 're thinking of pleasant things that are funny only to us .
Yes , only to us .
- Here come the replacements .
- None too soon .
Welcome to the easy life .
- So that 's the famous road ?
- Yes sir , captain .
The work is hard .
It 's pure granite .
We 're making slow progress .
- Plus , we 're getting shot at . - Must be coming from that peak at 1200m .
That 's right , sir .
We 're also getting it from that crest .
We 've done some scouting . But the arms smugglers run away whenever we get close .
This suburb seems packed with comforts and luxuries .
They 've stuffed our heads . Ultimately , we 'll wind up building more roads for tourists .
I 'm fed up .
I 'm a soldier , not a road contractor .
My wife and daughter are playing tennis even as we speak .
- That 's funny , no ?
- I don 't know , sir .
I 'm a bachelor .
I 'm not staying here 5 more minutes !
I 'm fed up , captain ! I want out of here !
You 'll give me 3 days for presenting yourself to your captain without prior authorization .
And 3 more days for having done so in an unkempt state .
You 're a dirty cow !
- Tell me . - What ?
I checked with an old-timer . Apparently in the village down the hill
- there 's an establishment of renowned delights . - Let 's go .
The boss , she 's the tall one over there .
They call her " Breadboard . "
She was bored in Europe .
Desert fever , in other words .
So she came back . Not for the business . She doesn 't care about money .
In other words , an intellectual .
After the mule , God created the ass , and after the ass , the legionnaire .
The birds do as they wish . They 're free .
So you have to please them , sweet-talk them . With my mug , I don 't get too lucky .
They 're all Bedouins , except for the tall blond in the back .
She 's German .
Oh , you only have eyes for the Pavlova .
Well , I have some inside dope .
She 's from Rabat .
She had some problems . Something about poisoned tea .
I 'm telling you what I heard .
Oh , Princess ...
- I 'll make you some tea .
- Tea !
- It 's nice here .
- Everything is mine .
I 'll show you .
I have treasures .
- Where did you learn such good French ?
- I used to dance in Meknes .
A lot of French legionnaires came to watch .
They were nice .
Then suddenly , for no reason , they 'd go crazy .
They 'd yell at the top of their lungs : " Get out of my face ! "
- And they 'd break everything .
- We call it the blues .
- You too , you get the blues ?
- Sometimes , like everyone .
And you 'll break everything ?
I don 't think so .
Come take a look .
It 's time .
They 're my friends .
When I 'm sad , I sit down in front of my clock , and I wait for them to come out .
They never miss an appointment .
Are you often sad ?
Come !
- Do you want to hear the sea ?
- The sea ?
Listen !
What do you use this compass for ?
I use it to find the south . That way , I can look towards my hometown .
I also have necklaces , bracelets and a gold coin .
I 'll put them on so that you 'll find me beautiful .
But I find you beautiful .
When they found me pretty ,
- other men would kiss me right away . - Would you like me to kiss you ?
Listen . I think that when a man and a woman like each other , the best thing ...
I know all of women 's secrets .
Yes , but you don 't know how to wait .
- Are these tattoos ?
- No , it 's henna .
- I 've never wanted to be marked .
- Oh yeah ?
I 'll come with a friend . He 'll mark down my name on your shoulder with needles .
- You move quickly .
- My name is Gilieth .
Pierre Gilieth .
I am Aischa Slaoui .
My mother came from Rabat .
No !
He 's having his face tattooed now ?
It 'll remove any temptation of going home if I ever get the blues .
I never want to see civilian scum again .
Damn , what a snob !
Gilieth is getting married tonight , and we 're invited .
Oh ! Here she comes !
Here she comes !
Go ahead . Make the cross .
Go ahead .
And so the blood of one mingles . with the blood of the other .
You have drunk from the red spring of life . May the sole God of my beliefs protect you .
So that 's it ... ? You 're married ?
- May I ?
- Yes .
Finally , some real music .
Today , I 'm buying .
- Let 's dance like we do in my country . - I don 't know how .
Doesn 't matter .
I 'll teach you .
Come .
First chance I get , I 'll shoot him dead , captain or not .
With or without mint , tea is forbidden today .
If I drink this , I 'll see everything upside down .
- How about now ?
- Go on , princess .
- Like it ?
- Yes .
What is it ?
What 's the matter ?
Oh , that 's too much , you bastard !
This neighborhood is prone to frequent night attacks .
You 'll accompany me to the camp .
Here 's my gun .
You 'll walk behind me .
You 'll do 15 days of labor for bragging about killing your captain and 15 more days for not having done it when you had the chance .
- A legionnaire cannot go back on his word .
- Yes , sir .
- Say , where are we going ?
- To the mountains , this weekend .
Apparently we 're hooking up with the 4th bandera .
They 're camped out there , and sparks are flying .
Never get taken prisoner .
And always keep a last bullet for yourself .
If those bastards take you alive , they cut off your head . Then they give your body to their women who cut you open to build a fire inside .
That 's what they call central heating .
I don 't care .
A fortune teller told me I 'd die of diabetes .
- What time do we leave . - 3 a.m.
Something 's brewing . Smells like a fight .
It 'll be good exercise .
We 're starting to get fat .
They 're sending us on recon , and reinforcements are supposed to turn up ...
- Now 's a good time to make a will .
- You 've got something to bequeath ?
- All I have : my body , to medical science .
- What are they supposed to do with it ?
They can study the illness I suffer from in the throat .
- What illness ?
- I suffer from thirst .
- Sir , reinforcements have been spotted . - Sound assembly .
Very well , sir .
Reinforcements are here !
- Say , Mulot .
- What ?
You never know ...
If I don 't come back .
Don 't worry .
I 'd take care of your wife .
It 's too bad we have to leave now .
I 've never been happier or more at peace than in this desert .
I wonder what he 's doing here .
I don 't get it .
The Captain had bounced him from the company .
He must have managed somehow .
I 'm not naturally curious , but I 'd give a year 's pay to know what he 's up to , all the way out here .
Here , look .
Looks like he 's already well-informed . I bet you he 's headed to " Breadboard 's . "
And in a big hurry , too .
I might as well find out . Things are turning sour , buddy , they 're turning sour .
- What 's this ?
- Tea .
No , not tea .
Give me an anisette .
Something strong .
Hey ...
- Is she your girlfriend ?
- It 's Aischa Slaoui .
- Does she dance ?
- For those she likes .
Aischa , will you dance for me ?
I have money , you know .
- So ?
- Aischa is tired .
Oh !
, Oh , Gilieth !
I 'm happy to see you , pal !
You too , Mulot .
This is great !
Leave the bottle !
Tonight , we 're having a party and getting smashed .
- I was so bored without you .
- Oh yeah ?
Without you around , life was just impossible . And you , Mulot , are you still as fond of soldiers ?
- You , get off my back .
- Be nice . I 've taken an interest in her .
You know , Aischa , Fernando Lucas is not Bedouin fluff .
Go on , dance .
Dance , girl , dance !
Don 't you follow orders anymore ?
Dance , since you 're being asked !
Dear lamb , all the blood of a soldier isn 't worth a single one of your tears .
And you paid such a high price for your wedding gown ...
Peace be with you .
I 'll give you some of the powder that was prepared for me by the holy man of Sadi Aissa .
Pour it in your friend 's tea . And his heart will come back to you .
Aischa ...
How strange you people are !
- I look in your eyes and I don 't understand . - I had to do what I did .
Listen to me carefully .
Would you like to get back to the south where you were born ,
- and be with your parents , your friends ?
- I have no friends where you aren 't .
We 'd leave together , both of us , you and I.
I 'd leave this uniform and dress like those of your tribe .
Would you like that ?
Yes !
I have 3,000 pesetas .
My savings .
Everything I 've earned in 3 years . It 's all yours .
- We can afford to take a great big car .
- Yes .
- Can I bring along all my treasures ?
- Yes .
My clocks , my fabrics , my belts .
Yes , but before then , you must ...
- I 'll do anything you want .
- Very well ...
That man downstairs is my greatest enemy .
I knew it !
I guessed it the moment he saw you .
Then , listen ...
Tomorrow , I leave for the mountains . I 'll be away for a few days .
During this time , Lucas , that 's his name , Lucas , he must come back here . And come back often .
Above all , don 't tell him that you 're my wife .
On the contrary , make him believe that you hate me , you think I 'm a brute . Make him talk . And try to find out where he comes from , and what he really thinks of me .
And if he stays mum ?
You 'll be nice to him . All he asks of you ... you will do .
Sometimes you have to give a lot before a man loosens his tongue .
But he must talk .
You hear me ?
He must !
- What time is it ?
- My watch is 42 francs late .
It 's in hock . Wait .
It must be 5 o 'clock .
5 o 'clock .
That 's when Fernando Lucas ...
Do you know Rue Saint-Vincent in Paris ?
You don 't know Rue Saint-Vincent ?
At number 25 , there 's a little villa .
That 's where I killed a man .
There 's a reward of 50,000 bills for whoever finds the killer .
I 'm sure that Lucas ...
As far as I can look back , I 've always been alone .
So , when he came along ...
Him or another , what difference could it make ?
But since , there are days when the shadow of Gilieth blocks out the sun .
You 're right .
Gilieth is extremely dangerous . But I know just the words to make him crawl into the ground .
Do you know Europe ?
I would like to know it .
If I go back there , would you come join me ?
I 'm not rich , but you won 't be unhappy .
My trade can become a profitable one .
But you 're a soldier .
Can you become a sergeant right away ?
I can do better than that .
I 'm not a soldier like Gilieth .
I may want to leave now , but when he returns , I won 't want to .
My will runs away in front of him like water through a sieve .
If you help me , I will rid you of him .
- Forever ?
- Forever .
Speak .
I will obey .
Listen ...
When he returns , ask him :
" What were you doing in Paris , a year ago , " at dawn , Rue Saint-Vincent ? "
- That 's funny !
- What were you doing ...
What were you doing in Paris , a year ago ,
- at dawn ...
- Rue ... Rue Saint-Vincent .
Rue Saint-Vincent .
As you say those words , be sure to look into his face carefully and what he tells you , you 'll need to repeat word for word to someone ...
And that will be the end .
Are you a police chief ?
So what ?
I work faithfully for society .
I 'll never dare to ask this of Gilieth .
You won 't need to fear him anymore .
You 'll be free .
I 'll marry you and I 'll take you to my country .
The men are coming back tomorrow . Will you help me ?
Force is on our side . And tomorrow , Gilieth will sleep in jail .
For now at least . God will take care of the rest .
They 've waited enough . They won 't send another dime . We must find a solution .
- And quickly . Lest you lose your position . - My position !
They should come be in my position . They 'll see how easy it is .
Anyway , I 'm close to my goal .
Take a look .
He 's going to " Breadboard 's . "
In a few minutes , I 'll be set .
I 'm going to know .
Ah finally , I 'm going to know .
" Ask him :
'What were you doing , a year ago , 'in Paris , at dawn , Rue ...
'Rue ... ' "
- Rue Saint-Vincent .
- That 's it !
- Do you want to know ?
- I don 't care .
- You don 't care that I killed a man ?
- I don 't care .
- Don 't you want to know why ?
- You must have had your reasons .
Peace be with you and with us .
This won 't be easy . It 'll take a while . Don 't stray too far away .
Come , Mulot .
Here comes rat face !
So , did everything go okay ?
May I ?
- Give me a drink .
- Don 't bother sitting down .
We were waiting for you .
Now that you 're here , we 're going to step outside .
I need to ask you a few explanations .
You can speak here .
No !
If you 're a man , you 'll go outside with me .
Okay ... okay ...
Just be careful with your movements .
We 're being watched .
Say goodbye to Slaoui .
Come on , Aischa . Say goodbye to the gentleman .
I can 't .
You can 't ?
Then spit in his face .
- Very nice , Aischa .
- Go on , walk in front .
And not one word or I 'll shoot you down .
- Where are we going ?
- Never mind . We 'll be out of sight .
As long as you 're alive , always keep this coin in memory of Aischa .
So you want to cash in on the 50 grands ?
50,000 bills , that 's a nice loot .
Assuming I don 't make you bleed like a pig .
I killed that guy on Rue Saint-Vincent .
I , Pierre Gilieth .
The son of a bitch didn 't deserve to live .
I executed him , you hear ?
One less piece of garbage , trust me .
And I 'd do it all over again .
So what ?
Get up .
You disgust me .
The ground is wet .
You might catch cold .
I 've often thought about you .
I knew that one day you 'd show yourself to be a snitch .
Well ? What are you going to do ?
You 'll sleep in jail tonight , Gilieth .
That 's interesting .
Don 't you see what our lives are like here ?
Don 't you get that men who made this choice deserve to be left in peace .
But that 's not enough ? They still need cops on their tails ! To watch their binges , spy on their sleep , stalk their loneliness !
- You 'll sleep in jail tonight .
- Is that what you thought ?
Oh !
Here 's your knife .
You might need it .
Listen carefully .
My life is over now .
I had been planning to escape to the south with Slaoui . But that plan 's worthless now . I 'd be caught before I got there .
And there 's something else now .
I won 't end up like a louse .
You hear , copper ?
With just one move , I can wipe you out like an eraser .
And then , I 'm free .
But I 'm going to surprise you .
I 'm not a murderer .
I don 't care about your hide .
I 'm letting you go .
See that ? If you talk , there 's one for you and another for me .
Now you can go rat me out .
Good day .
[ Bugle . ] What 's happening ?
They 're sounding assembly .
Legionnaires , you are men without country . You enlisted to serve Spain . Now she needs you .
She is asking you , without holding back to die for a cause she supports , in accordance with the contract you chose to sign .
Even at the moment of your death , she owes you no other explanation .
An entire region is rebelling .
We have a post in the mountains , about 100 kms from here that can keep the enemy in check for several days .
Until we can organize our defenses , I need 24 men to occupy this post .
I have absolute right over you .
And I can arbitrarily pick those men .
But I want volunteers . I want volunteers for death .
None of your comrades have come back alive from this fort .
I need 24 men to defend it .
Those who are ready to die , step forward .
I myself will take command of this detachment .
There 's no reward , this time .
- Pick 24 men .
- Yes , sir .
Gentlemen , I thank you .
To the right , to the left , the first 12 men , step forward .
Beef stew was on Wednesdays .
She really had a way to make it !
Some well-marbled beef and a calf 's foot , with some baby carrots .
- And bits of bacon for flavor .
- Enough . You 're making my belly hurt .
To think we joined up because we were starving .
This is taking us back .
How about a game ?
Just one !
A game of cards ? A quick one .
Pay attention .
The captain is calling me .
We should try to go outside to bury our dead comrades .
The air in here is unbearable .
But that 's impossible , sir .
We 're under direct fire from the bastards .
- But we could take off the roofing .
- If you wish .
Take command of the post . I don 't have too much longer left .
Yes , sir .
You , get rid of the ceiling .
Oh no , the sun ...
Oh the sun , dear God !
Muller , where are you going ?
- I forbid you from going out .
- Captain ...
- I 'm going to get you some water .
- I forbid you ...
The water hole is under surveillance .
You know we can 't get there .
Muller !
The dirty cows !
You know this is poisoned !
Look at the guys !
He 's crazy !
You 're nuts !
By God , no one is drinking from this again !
Stop , stop !
To your posts , immediately !
Mulot !
Mulot , to your post !
To your post , I say !
Mulot !
Where the hell is that rescue column ?
We 're dying of hunger and thirst here !
They were probably stopped . Maybe that cannon we heard all night is responsible .
Isn 't that what our planes are for ?
It 's one of ours , guys !
It 's Lieutenant Garcia 's squadron .
He must have run into the bastards !
I 'll show this pig !
- He 's coming back !
- Take cover !
Lie down !
Play dead !
Hurrah !
Hurrah !
Hurrah !
This time , we 're screwed .
You 're telling me !
If I have to die , I don 't want to die of thirst .
- I 'm going to get some water .
- Stay here !
Don 't worry .
I 've figured out how to get there , and I 'll be careful .
- Anyway , at the point where we are ...
- Did you go nuts too ?
If I 'm not back in three or four weeks , and one day you go by Place Blanche , stop by the newsstand at the corner . Tell the guys that Mulot died for a glass of water .
I 'd love to see the look on their faces !
Captain !
So , you 're with the police .
Yes , sir .
My enlistment is void .
I only signed up to ...
I don 't want to know anything .
If I had known your identity sooner , I would have drummed you out .
People like you have no business being with us .
Our men deserve to be forgotten .
I volunteered to follow you here .
If you get out alive , you will leave this uniform , you will return to Europe ...
Yes , sir .
And you will forget . - Did you understand me ?
- Yes , sir .
By your command , sir .
Ow ! Bastards !
I don 't care .
I 'm not thirsty anymore ...
- Mulot is dead .
I 'm going to get him .
- They 'll kill you too .
Does that inconvenience you , copper ?
You had other plans for me . But he 's my friend ! My friend !
It 's over , Gilieth . You know it .
Ah ... And if we get out of this ?
You won 't have to worry about me .
Listen .
The two of us came here together .
We don 't care what the world thinks of us .
But since we 're going to die , we mustn 't die like pigs .
Come on .
- We 're going to make it . - Oh , Gilieth !
- Life is beautiful !
- Oh , my God !
What ? Gilieth !
Gilieth !
Gilieth !
The replacements are here , mate !
They 're here !
Captain !

Your Ladyship , please .
Douglas ?
The door , Thomas .
Is everybody here , I presume ?
- Yes , sir .
- Everyone except the heir from America .
- Oh , well , no need to wait for him .
I was notified of his arrival in town today , but I 've no faith in it .
So we 'll proceed to the business on hand .
To wit , the reading of the will of the late Angus lan McLaurel a kindly master , a friendly friend and a loyal Scot whom everybody respected .
- God rest his soul .
- Amen .
If you don 't mind , I 'll omit the legal phraseology , get down to the bequests .
" First , I bequeath to my grandson in America , Stanley McLaurel whom I 've never seen , a ... "
Laddie , what do you make that out to be ?
Could you tell us where we could find a policeman ?
You 'll have to pardon my friend , officer , he 's a stranger here .
I wonder if you could direct us to the best hotel in your fair city .
- Right over there , sir .
- Thank you .
Thank you .
No , nothing today .
Good day , madam .
We 'd like for you to give us a room and a bath , please .
I can give you the room , but you 'll have to take the bath yourself .
- By the day or the week ?
- You 'd better make it by the day .
You see , my friend Mr. McLaurel is heir to the McLaurel estate and we 're moving in there shortly .
- Is that a fact ?
Oh , I can see the likeness now .
- Did you know the old gentleman ?
- Known him for nigh on to 40 years .
'Twas a sad ending he had .
- What did he die of ?
- He died of a broken heart .
You see , he had a no-good son by the name of Sandy who ran away to America and married a queen .
- Royalty ?
- " Royalty . " No , a burlesque queen .
One of those play-actors .
And the old man never forgave him .
- Well , what became of Sandy ?
- They had a wee baby boy .
And when Sandy saw the baby for the first time he committed suicide .
Can you beat that ?
What a face that kid must have had .
Sandy was your father .
And I don 't blame him .
- Will you show us to our room , please ?
- Upstairs , and the first door to the left .
Thank you .
Come on .
Oh , my goodness !
" Therefore , the residue of my estate , real and personal I do bequeath to my granddaughter , Lorna McLaurel . "
Isn 't that wonderful ?
" I make the above bequest to my granddaughter providing she accedes to my wishes , to wit :
I do appoint Colonel Gregor McGregor at present serving with His Majesty 's forces in India to be the sole guardian of her estate and person until she shall reach the age of 21 . "
Well , congratulations , my dear .
The proviso is not so bad .
You 'll like my brother , I 'm sure .
- Your brother ?
- Oh , of course , I forgot .
This is all a surprise to you .
Colonel McGregor is my brother .
And he sent me over here to fetch you out to India .
India ?
You mean , I must really leave Scotland ?
Why , it 's always been my home and I love it .
There 's nothing to get upset about .
We 'll talk about this another time .
When you 're over the shock of finding yourself one of Scotland 's richest girls .
Yes .
But I 'm not going to India .
Alan , you heard what they said .
But you 'd never let me go so far away , would you ?
Well , I ...
I ...
Or would you ?
Oh , Alan .
Alan , that 's thousands of miles away .
Alan , dear , don 't let me go .
Keep me here near you .
Please .
- I don 't wanna go away .
- There , my dear .
You come along with me until you can quiet down .
This thing can be settled without upsetting anybody .
- You 'll excuse me , I know .
Come along .
- I don 't wanna go .
Alan !
Oh , Mr. Miggs , what am I gonna do ?
There , there , lad , everything will be all right .
And now , I thank you for your gracious attention .
That 's all .
There 's no hurry .
You 'll get what 's coming to you .
I 'm Mr. Hardy .
This is my friend Mr. McLaurel .
- I believe we 're expected .
- Oh , yes , sir .
Step right in , sir .
Just a moment , gentlemen , and I 'll announce you .
Thank you .
- Nice fellow , isn 't he ?
- Charming .
I think I 'll retain his services .
That 's a good idea .
He sure can " buttle . "
- Oh . By the way ...
Mr. Miggs .
- Yes , Mrs. Bunts ?
The next time you drop down to Glasgow , you must come up and see me sometime .
- Thank you .
- That 's Mae West .
- Mr. Miggs will see you .
Follow me .
- Thank you .
- Right this way , sir .
- Yes , sir .
- Order the gig and wait for me .
- Yes , sir .
- Now , gentlemen .
- How do you do , Mr. Miggs .
I 'm Mr. Hardy .
This is my friend Mr. McLaurel .
- I 'm glad to meet you .
Take a chair .
- Thank you .
And now , Mr. McLaurel , I 'd like to see your credentials .
I beg your pardon , Mr. Miggs , I didn 't get you .
I asked Mr. McLaurel if he had any credentials .
- Just what do you mean , Mr. Miggs ?
- Something to identify himself with .
To prove that he is Stanley McLaurel .
For instance , a passport .
I 'm sorry , sir , but we haven 't one .
- What ?
No passport ?
- No , sir .
You see , it was like this :
We were in such a hurry to get away , we forgot to get one .
- Well , how did you get into the country ?
- We stowed away on a cattle boat .
The roughest trip I ever ...
Oh , well , if you can 't prove who you are , there 's nothing to be done .
I wonder if these would do , Mr. Miggs .
- Right there , sir .
- Yes .
Oh , I 'm sorry .
My mistake .
That 's the one .
- Is that you ?
- Yes .
That was taken three years ago .
You can see I wasn 't feeling very good .
- See , my left ...
- Well , it 's proof enough .
- Like father , like son .
- That 's fine .
Now that 's all settled could we get down to business ?
- Yes .
" Know all men by these present , that I , Angus lan McLaurel being of sound mind and ... "
- Pardon me , Mr. Miggs .
- Is it necessary to read that ?
- Well , no .
Well , let 's skip it and get down to what we 're going to get .
" First , I do bequeath to my grandson , Stanley McLaurel whom I 've never seen , two of my most cherished possessions with the hope that he 'll preserve them and hand them down from generation to generation . "
You 're a very lucky man , Mr. McLaurel and you 'll be the envy of many a true Scot .
Look at that .
Blown at Waterloo , sounding the charge at Balaklava whistling defiance at Mafeking and the praise of victory at Mons .
And last but not least , this snuff box .
Presented for valor by Mary Queen of Scots to your great-great-great-great - great-great-grandfather .
And a grand man he was .
- Is this all we get ?
- That 's all , sir .
And I wish you a very pleasant voyage back to America .
Thomas , show these gentlemen to the door and tell Lady Ormsby I 'd like to speak to her at her convenience .
Yes , sir .
This way , gentlemen .
Good day , gentlemen .
There we are .
- Well , here I am .
At your service .
- Oh , thank you , Your Ladyship .
You know , I 'm anxious to have this affair settled .
Here 's the probate of the will and the term of the colonel 's trusteeship duly signed , sealed and now delivered .
Thank you , Mr. Miggs . I 'll see that my brother gets them safely .
I shall mention your efficient handling of the whole affair .
You can depend on that .
I 'm worried about the lassie .
This romance with my clerk is more serious than I suspected .
She 's got a mind of her own .
And if she decides not to go it will be ruinous for her .
- Of course it would be .
Oh , this love affair , or romance as you call it , doesn 't mean anything .
- Love affairs at that age never do .
- You may be right but I don 't like the job of forcing her to go away .
You won 't have to .
The boy will do that .
He seems a reasonable , manly sort of chap .
I know .
You send him to me and I 'll see what can be done .
Oh , I 'll do that at once , Your Ladyship .
And thank you again .
Oh , it takes a woman to handle the affairs of the heart .
I 'll say goodbye to you for the present and thank you for your gracious help .
- Goodbye , Mr. Miggs .
- I 'll send the boy to you at once .
Well , here 's another nice mess you 've gotten me into .
All the way from America on a cattle boat for this Mr. McLaurel .
That isn 't the way to use that .
Dry these .
Mr. McLaurel .
Mind your own business .
Blown at Waterloo .
What do you think we 'd better do , Ollie ?
I expected that .
Every time you get us into a mess you come to me expecting me to get us out of it .
Well , it wasn 't my fault .
What do you mean , it wasn 't your fault ?
If you hadn 't been so money-mad , we wouldn 't be here .
There we were , comfortably settled in jail with one more week to serve .
And you had to talk me into breaking out just to come on this wild-goose chase of yours .
Well , I guess we 'll have to stow our way back home again .
Go to the jail and tell the warden we 're sorry for the trouble we put him to and maybe we 'll get our old cell back .
- Be more comfortable to be there than ...
- Why , if we went back there that warden would give us life .
For escaping .
Well , we could go to another jail where the warden didn 't know us .
Serve our week and nobody would be any the wiser .
Pay our debt to society and then we wouldn 't have to worry a bit ...
Why , if we went to any jail in that state the warden would give us life .
In fact , he 'd hang us .
We could go to another state .
You know what we could do ?
We could go way , way out west where they 'd never find us .
Out west where ?
Oh , Philadelphia , Jersey Ci ...
Any of those places where they have no exposition laws .
What do you mean , " no exposition laws " ?
Well , if the police found out where we were they could come and get us if we didn 't want them to ...
If we ...
If they knew .
That 's a very , very , very good idea .
Just as soon as my pants are dry , we 'll formulate our plans .
Step aside .
That 's the only pair of pants I 've got in the world .
Alan !
Come , lass .
Come , lass .
Now , hurry , hurry , hurry .
I don 't want to .
Alan !
- Good morning , Mr. McLaurel .
- Good morning , Mrs. Bickerdike .
Where is Mr. Hardy ?
I haven 't seen him in the past three weeks .
- Oh , he 's awful sick .
- Is that a fact ?
Hoot , ma 'am .
You know , the day he fell in the water , he got an awful cold and it turned into pneumatics .
- Is he very sick ?
- You 're darn hooting he 's sick .
The only thing he can keep on his stomach is a hot-water bottle .
- My , my , what a predicament .
- Yeah , I think he 's got that too .
Well , give him my respects .
- I surely will .
- And also give him this .
It 's the bill for three weeks ' rent .
I 'm getting very impatient waiting for this estate to get cleared up .
We were talking about that this morning .
I 'll see ...
- Who 's there ?
- It 's me .
- Come in .
- Are you dressed ?
Come in .
Where have you been ?
The landlady gave me this .
It 's the bill for three weeks ' rent .
There are more important things than this .
Did you get me any pants ?
- No , but I got something to eat .
- What ?
- Where 'd you get it ?
- I traded our overcoats for it .
That 's just like you .
Thinking of your stomach before my pride .
How are you going to cook it ?
- I never thought of that .
- No , you wouldn 't .
Once again , I have to come to your rescue and be the mother of invention .
What you going to do ?
I 'm going to cook the fish over the candle .
I 've got an idea that 's better than your mother 's invention .
- What ?
- Hold this and I 'll show you .
A grill .
Put the candle under there and we can cook the fish on top .
Why , that 's exactly what I intended to do .
Now , give me the fish .
You watch the fish and see that it doesn 't burn .
How does it look ?
Never looked better in all its life .
Well , bring it over because I 'm as hungry as a hunter .
Where 's the rest of it ?
It " shrizzled . "
Well , I 'm glad you didn 't bring a sardine .
What 's going on here ?
- Mr. Hardy just had a relapse .
- A relapse ?
He 's awful sick .
What are you doing ?
!
Put it out !
Put it out !
Put it out !
Do something !
Well , do something !
This has gone far enough !
Rent or no rent , get out of my house !
You ... You foreigners !
- He can 't go out .
He hasn 't got pants .
- Come on !
Pack up your things and get out !
Get out of my house !
Oh , no , you don 't !
I 'll hold these till you settle up .
- What are you laughing at ?
- Why shouldn 't I laugh ?
Here am I , Oliver Norvell Hardy a man without a home .
A man without a country .
A man without any pants !
- Well , I don 't see anything to laugh at .
- Neither do I !
- Isn 't that swell ?
- Why , that 's wonderful .
- Says we can get a new suit of clothes for nothing . - What does it say ?
Come on .
- Didn 't you hear me say to come on ?
- Yeah , but you didn 't say which way .
I thought you ...
- How do you do , sir ?
- How do you do , gentlemen ?
What can I do for you ?
Why , we read your advertisement and we 've come to accept your offer .
Yeah , we 'd like to get measured right away .
Aye . Well , if you 'll just sign your name to the bottom of that .
Yes , sir .
Now , if you 'll follow me , please .
Major , here 's a couple of new customers .
Fix them up .
Thank you very much for your courtesy , sir .
Come here .
Here 's the king 's shilling .
What 's this for ?
That 's to bind the bargain .
You 're now in His Majesty 's service .
- What do you mean ?
- You 're in the army .
What 's that got to do with this ?
Oh , that 's the tailor shop upstairs .
I 'm afraid there 's been a slight mistake .
We came here to be measured for a suit of clothes .
Well , don 't worry .
We 'll give you a suit of clothes you 'll be proud of .
- Sergeant .
- Yes , sir ?
Have the medical officer thump them over and take them to the barracks .
Aye .
You come along with me .
Come along now , you hear ?
Do you think they 're kidding ?
Why , certainly they 're kidding .
They 're having the time of their lives .
- Well , let 's tell them we 're wise to them .
- You heard what the man said .
We 're in the army .
Well , I didn 't know .
I thought we 're coming up to get some clothes ...
Now , this is the third deed you 've spoilt in a week .
I want to assist you , but for the last three months you 've not been worth your salt .
I know , Mr. Miggs , but I ... I ...
That 's the postman .
A brisk morning , Mr. Douglas .
- Good morning , Mr. Miggs .
- Good morning .
Wait .
Are you sure that 's all ?
There isn 't one for me ?
Sorry , lad , but that 's all .
Sorry , sir .
- Ollie .
- What ?
Do you feel a draft ?
After what I 've gone through , nothing matters .
Come in .
Good morning , Mr. Miggs .
- What ye doing ?
You 're all dressed up .
- We 're in the army .
How do we look ?
God save the king .
I wonder if we could ask a favor of you , Mr. Miggs .
Well , that depends .
What is it ?
You see , sir , we 're leaving town .
And if any mail should come for us will you forward it to that address ?
- Well , I might do that .
" Private McLaurel .
Private Hardy .
Third Battalion , Caledonia Highlanders , Pellore Northwest Frontier Province , India . "
India .
Well , that 's a coincidence .
That 's the station commanded by Colonel McGregor .
If you see Lady Ormsby or Miss Lorna McLaurel will you give them my regards ?
- Thank you .
- Goodbye , Mr. Miggs .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye , Alan .
- Goodbye , Mr. Miggs .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye , Ollie .
- Goodbye , Stanley .
Goodbye , Alan .
Well , wait . Wait !
I 've found a way out , Mr. Miggs .
Oh , I appreciate everything you 've done , but this means more to me than my life .
- Will you release me ?
- I 'll not stand in your way , laddie .
- Oh , thank you , sir .
- But where are you going ?
- I 'm going to Lorna .
To India .
- To India ?
My , my .
The wonders of youth .

Cool them off slowly .
They 've had a run .
- Happy ?
- Oh , yes , Greg .
The ride was glorious .
- Am I improving ?
- I would say you were perfect .
- Oh , Greg , I 'm afraid you 're prejudiced .
- Right .
Of all the selfish people ...
If it means anything to you two , I 've been waiting here for over an hour .
One must admire Vi Ormsby 's skill .
She 's managed the whole affair .
It 's a positive godsend for Colonel McGregor .
It hasn 't been easy with nothing but his pay .
- Has the girl money ?
- Oodles of it , my dear .
Comes into one of the richest estates in Scotland when she becomes 21 .
- The colonel handles it till then .
- Oh , now I understand .
- lf he marries , he 'll ...
- " lf " ?
My dear , it 's as good as settled .
Vi is clever , deucedly clever .
We 'd just ridden down by the river ...
- Beg pardon , sir .
- What is it ?
General Fletcher 's compliments .
Wishes to see you .
- All right , corporal .
I 'll be over .
- Very good , sir .
I 'll be back as soon as I can .
You should be very proud of your brother , Vi .
He 's such a good soldier .
But I am very proud of him .
He 's too much of a soldier .
I wish he 'd forget orders , routines and commands and think more of himself .
- He seems well satisfied .
- That 's just it .
He 's too well satisfied .
Content to settle down here and get nothing personal out of life .
He lives too much unto himself .
You know , what he needs is a wife .
Well , are you suggesting we pick one for him ?
Listen , Lorna , let 's stop fencing .
You know very well what I 'm getting at .
Greg adores you and wants you to be his wife .
Why don 't you marry him ?
Greg 's a dear , Vi .
I do like him .
Love him in a way .
But I 've never thought of him as a husband .
Really , I haven 't .
You see most of my heart 's been in Scotland .
Oh , stop it , Lorna .
We promised never to speak of that again .
The boy that 's never written to you , never thought about you .
Don 't be so silly .
Maybe you 're right .
I am silly .
I 'll forget it .
I have to .
We 'll live only in the future .
- And Greg ?
- Perhaps and Greg .
- Oh , splendid , darling .
Right away . Hurry up .
This way .
Everything 's ready .
Everything 's ...
Everything ...
What are you two holding up this line for ?
Come on !
Get off !
Ready !
Forward march !
I had to see you personally .
- Then it 's serious .
- Very .
- Trouble with Khan Mir Jutra .
- That fellow again ?
Yet I wish I could meet him and have my way .
I 'd teach him a lesson .
Well , it 's because you 've never met him that I 'm here .
I 'm sending you to Fort Rannu .
Oh , yes , yes. I ...
I know it 's a nuisance , but the fellow 's dangerous .
There 's only three officers and a handful of men there .
If he goes mad and kicks over the traces , they 'll be butchered like sheep .
Take whatever force you think adequate and move up to Rannu .
- At once , sir ?
- Oh , Monday will do .
Soothe Jutra 's feelings , if possible but if he won 't listen to reason , let him have it as hard as you can .
- Right ?
- Right , sir .
The new draft is nearly here , sir .
- I 'll be on the parade ground in moments .
- Very good , sir .
Company , halt !
Right turn !
Orders up !
Attention !
Platoon , hut !
Present , hut !
Stand them at ease , please .
Stand at ease .
Stand at ease .
As your commanding officer I welcome you to India .
- Do you care to say a few words , sir ?
- Yes .
Now , I want to impress upon you men two facts :
First , that the most important thing with which you 'll have to contend is the sun .
Sunstroke can kill a man just as surely , just as swiftly as a native bullet .
And second , you 've got to remember that India is truly a land of mystery .
With a great deal that even to us old campaigners is strange and difficult of explanation .
You 'll therefore have to take on trust many things which may appear to you not only unreasonable but at times absolutely impossible .
That 's all I have to say , Colonel McGregor .
- Dismiss the parade .
- Sir .
Company , attention !
Dismissed !
- See you later .
- All right , Alan .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
I wonder where we get the key to our room .
I don 't know .
I 'll find out .
Oh , sergeant .
- What is it ?
- Where do we get the key for our room ?
Yeah , we 'd like to take a bath .
We 're all worn out .
Aren 't we ?
What do you think this is ?
Get to the barracks before I lose my temper .
- Come on !
Get out of here .
- All we want is a room .
A room and bath .
Come on , boys , clear out .
- Alan .
- Yes ?
You going to see Lorna ?
- Say , Ollie .
- What ?
What was that the general was trying to tell us that he didn 't know himself ?
You know , about the mysteries or something .
I don 't know .
Ask old leatherpuss .
- Who ?
- Leatherpuss .
Sergeant Leatherpuss .
- Are you speaking to me ?
- Yes , sir .
Who informed you my name was Leatherpuss ?
He did .
My name is Sergeant Finlayson to you from now on .
Now , what do you want ?
I was trying to find out what the general meant when he said about the mysteries ...
- A couple of newies , boys .
Not dry behind the ears yet .
- Explain to them what the general meant .
- We 'll take care of that .
" Leatherpuss . "
I 'll remember that .
You tattletale .
" Leatherpuss . "
- Why don 't you look where you 're going !
- I 'm sorry , sergeant .
I didn 't see you .
Hey .
Did you see that ?
That was one of the things the general was talking about .
That was one of them mirages .
You know what a mirage is , don 't you ?
A mirage is something that you see that isn 't there or something that is there , but you can 't see it .
I had one happen to me just about an hour ago .
On the parade ground , it was .
A fellow comes up to me and he says :
" Look , Danny , " says he .
" Here comes the new draft . "
" Where ? " says I. " Through the gate , " says he .
And I looks up and do you know what ?
I couldn 't see a blooming thing .
I understand perfectly .
Thanks for tipping us off .
You understand what they were talking about ?
Why , certainly .
Sounds screwy to me .
Why , there 's nothing screwy about it .
You heard what the gentleman said .
A mirage is something you see that isn 't there .
Or something that isn 't there that you don 't see .
For instance :
There it is .
There it isn 't .
Now , it 's still there , but you can 't see it .
That 's a mirage .
Gee , I 'm dumb today .
Today ?
Hey .
So you still don 't believe it , huh ?
All right , I 'll prove to you that there is such a thing as a mirage .
- Where 's my accordion ?
- In there .
Ladies and gentlemen I have never had a greater privilege than announcing to you the engagement of a young lady from bonnie Scotland whom we 've all learned to love :
Miss Lorna McLaurel .
And now to tell you the name of the lucky man .
It is my old friend and brother officer , Colonel Gregor McGregor .
Now , let 's drink to their long life , health and happiness .
Lorna .
Greg .
You can 't do that to me .
You can 't .
- Steady .
- Let me go .
Man , are you crazy ?
What the devil are you doing here ?
You don 't understand .
Let me go .
Now , another move out of you , and it 'll be guardroom for you , young fellow .
I don 't care .
Let me go , will you ?
Attention .
Take him out .
Oh , Greg .
What do you suppose has happened ?
Touch of the sun , I imagine .
Probably one of the new drafts .
Poor fellow .
Don 't keep doing that .
- You look just like a grasshopper .
- Well , I was ...
Now if you 're gonna walk with me , you 've got to keep in step .
Now , go back and get in step .
Go on .
Get back .
- Now , that 's better .
Come on .
- Hey .
Your pal Douglas wants to see you right away .
Says it 's important .
- Where is he ?
- He 's in the cooler , that 's where he is .
- I wonder what he 's doing in the cooler .
- I don 't blame him .
This hot weather .
- I wouldn 't mind ...
- He 's not in there for his health .
He 's in trouble .
Come on .
Will you get in step ?
Try it backwards .
Now , left , left , left .
All right , let 's go .
Now you 've got it .
Fine .
Hey , Alan .
- Hello , fellas .
- What happened ?
- I don 't know .
I kind of lost my head .
- Lost your head ?
You didn 't lose your head .
It 's still there but you can 't see it .
- It 's one of those things ...
- Will you shut up ?
- How long you in for ?
- They 're gonna let me out in a few hours .
- Will you do me a favor ?
- Why , certainly .
You 're the only ones I can trust .
Try and find Lorna and give her this note as soon as you can .
It 's very important .
- We certainly will .
Won 't we , Stanley ?
- We sure will .
- Won 't we ?
- We cer ... Come on , go on .
- Ollie .
- What ?
Don 't let anyone know about it , will you ?
- Nobody must get that note but Lorna .
- Mum 's the word .
- What ?
- Mum 's the word .
- Goodbye , Alan .
- Goodbye .
You two run along .
I want to talk to Millie .
She 's getting beyond me .
Millie .
Her Ladyship .
Quick , hide .
I 'll lose me job .
Quick , in the cupboard .
Right there .
Yes , milady .
Coming , milady .
Millie .
- Did you call me , Your Ladyship ?
- You know I called you .
We 're going to watch the polo .
We 'll have dinner promptly at 7 .
- Yes , milady .
Dinner promptly at 7 .
- Wait a minute .
Let me impress on you once again :
No entertaining while we 're out .
- Milady , I wouldn 't think of such a thing .
- Well , I 'm warning you .
The colonel may be back any minute .
If he catches you , it 's back to England .
- Yes , milady .
- Very well .
Ain 't she the high and mighty one .
Denying a little girl a bit of sparking .
- Has she gone ?
- Yes , thank goodness .
I thought for a minute the game was up .
She didn 't half tell me off .
I heard her .
I was a wee bit afraid myself .
It 's a wonder you didn 't hear my knees knocking .
Oh , Millie , I ...
I warned you .
Pack your things .
You 're leaving by the first boat for England .
Give me another chance .
I 'll try to do better the next time .
No .
I 've finished with you .
Well , cast me over the hurdles .
I 'll get even with you if it 's the last thing I do .
I beg your pardon , sir , but could you tell us were we could find Miss Lorna ?
- What do you want with Miss McLaurel ?
- He 's got a note for her .
- You have a note for my ward ?
- No , sir .
Why you ...
Alan gave it to you in the cell ...
Look here , have you a note or haven 't you ?
- Yes , sir .
- Give it to me .
You lied to me .
Report at once to Sergeant Finlayson .
As for you , my man , your actions are commendable .
- You fixed me up pretty , didn 't you ?
- Well , you shouldn 't tell a lie .
The first time that you tell a lie , it serves you ...
- Who did that ?
- He did .
- I did nothing ...
- Report to Sergeant Finlayson at once .
- You see that he gets there .
- I did nothing of ...
- Yes , sir .
Thank you .
- I did nothing .
I didn 't kick ...
Vi , who 's Alan Douglas ?
- Do you know him ?
- Alan Douglas ?
Why , yes , slightly .
I met him in Scotland .
He 's a raw , uncouth sort of boy who works for Miggs .
- But why all this interest ?
- He 's here in India .
A private in the regiment .
Oh , but , Greg , you are a simpleton .
This is all so plain to me .
Just a case of puppy love in Scotland .
You know , promises of undying affection and all that sort of thing .
Then Lorna inherited this money and the boy thought he might as well be in on it .
Most people would do anything for L200,000 .
Oh , Greg , tear up this note and forget it .
Lorna 's told me time and time again she 's forgotten all about this boy .
She loves you and she 's promised to marry you .
- Oh , don 't risk a scene .
- It won 't do , Vi .
Sooner or later they 're bound to meet .
We 'd better get it over with .
- You 're not going to give it to her ?
- I haven 't quite made up my mind yet .
Vi , not a word to Lorna about this .
I want to think this out for myself .
For once .
Greg , you 've got to cheer up .
The next thing you know , there will be gossip .
Walla .
What are you going to do ?
Miss McLaurel is dancing .
Take this note to her , but don 't tell her where it comes from .
Understand ?
Oh , Greg , you fool .
You 're risking your own happiness .
I 'm thinking of Lorna now .
Pardon me .
- Bad news ?
- Oh , no , general .
Wonderful news .
Lorna .
Lorna !
Alan .
Yes .
Alan .
Look at me .
Didn 't expect me , did you ?
Thought I was thousands of miles away crying my heart out .
Well , I fooled you .
I 'm here .
Private Douglas , come to pay his respects to the colonel 's lady .
- Why , you 're mad .
I won 't listen to you .
- Yes , you will .
- But I can explain .
- I 've seen and heard enough myself .
The money 's gone to your head .
I was fool enough to believe you because I had faith trusted you when you were laughing at me .
- Oh , stop it !
Stop it !
- I won 't stop it .
It isn 't true .
You must listen to me .
You don 't know what you 're saying .
You don 't understand .
My only wish is that I never see or hear of you again .
A strong force , Khan Sahib .
Much stronger than I expected .
This calls for strategy .
How are you , Corbett ?
Glad to see you .
We 're very glad to see you , colonel .
We 've been sitting on a powder barrel for two weeks .
Enough has happened to make my small force very jumpy .
- We 're all glad you 're here .
- Thank you .
Dismiss the men .
They need a good rest .
Then call the officers to the orderly room .
- We 'll go to work .
- Sir .
Vi , you knew Alan was here and didn 't tell me .
Why ?
Why ?
Come in .
I 'll come back , Miss Lorna , when you 're not so busy .
- That 's all right , Millie , come in .
- I didn 't want to bother you , miss but I 'd like to have a few words with you personally before leaving .
Leaving ?
What do you mean ?
She didn 't tell you ?
I suspected as much .
We 'll , Her Ladyship has discharged me and I 'm on me way to England .
But you 've been awfully kind to me , and it would be hard on me conscience if I didn 't tell you something you ought to know .
- Millie , leave the room at once .
- Not until I 've had my say .
- How dare you ?
Leave the room .
- Wait , Vi .
- What is it , Millie ?
- Well , Miss Lorna you 've wondered why you haven 't heard from your friend in Scotland .
I 'll tell you why .
She 's been taking your letters , every one of them .
But , Lorna , you can 't believe such a ridiculous story .
- The woman 's mad .
- Yes , Your Ladyship , mad .
But you thought you destroyed those letters , didn 't you ?
Well , you didn 't .
Because I fished them out of the fire coals and here they are .
Now , Your Ladyship , put that in your pipe and smoke it .
His letters .
My letters .
I understand it all now .
But , Lorna , I did it for your good .
- I thought you 'd be happy ...
- Oh , never mind .
I 'm glad I found out before I ruined Greg 's life too .
But it isn 't too late .
I 'll go to Alan and tell him everything .
But , Lorna , you can 't .
He 's at Fort Rannu .
This has just arrived , sir .
The messenger 's at the gate and demands an immediate answer .
Well , gentlemen I hope you have no other social engagement this afternoon .
We are dining with Mir Jutra .
- This afternoon , sir ?
- It won 't be so bad .
I tell you what .
We 'll put on our best bib and tucker and make an impression .
- Eh , Corbett ?
- A very good idea , sir .
Gentlemen , get ready .
You fellows got nothing else to do ?
Get out of here .
Do that again .
Show me that again .
Hey !
Come here !
I thought I told you to clean this place up .
Well , he told me not to pay any attention to what you said .
Who 's running this army ?
You or me ?
Right .
Now get to work !
And don 't let me see a speck when I get back .
" Leatherpuss . "
Now do it .
Come on , boys .
We 'll try number four again .
And for any favor , put some life into it .
- Where did you get this fellow ?
- We caught this man mining the gate .
Who sent you ?
- Quiet , quiet .
- Quiet .
We made him talk , sir .
We found out everything .
Take him away .
Keep him under guard .
- See that he communicates with no one .
- Yes , sir .
- What did you find out ?
- Mir Jutra plans to attack Rannu as soon as you and your officers are at his palace .
- Blowing the gate was to be the signal .
- He 's asked for it .
He shall have it .
Corbett , call for volunteers .
We 'll put them in our uniforms and send them to the palace in our stead .
Then we 'll arrange a reception for Mir Jutra 's men here .
- We 'll capture every one of the beggars .
- Very good , sir .
But these volunteers , they 're going to almost certain death .
That 's the chance we have to take .
The safety of the border depends upon smashing this madman once and for all .
Douglas , my boy , I 'm proud of you for being the first to volunteer .
It 's a dangerous mission we 're going on and we may never come back .
- What matter ?
- Hey , hurry up , you two !
We wanna thank you for inviting us to this lunch .
Yeah , it sure was nice of you .
You 're welcome .
Now , get on your horses and let 's go .
- Do we have to ride on horses ?
- What do you think they 're here for ?
Well , I never rode a horse in me life .
All you 've got to do is to get on his back .
Come on .
- What are you trying to do ?
- He told me I had to get on your back .
He means the horse .
The officers have fallen into our trap .
Get them busy on the gate !
I must beat these dogs to the palace .
May be a messenger from Pellore .
Bring him in .
It 's Miss McLaurel , sir .
Miss McLaurel here ?
lmpossible !
Lorna , dear , what on earth are you doing here ?
Greg , I must see Alan Douglas at once .
At once , do you understand ?
- What 's happened ?
- Your sister held up all my letters .
Made me believe Alan had forgotten me .
But he hasn 't , Greg .
He hasn 't .
I must see him and explain everything . Now . At once .
Do you understand ?
Now .
Orderly .
Bring Private Alan Douglas here at once .
Private Alan Douglas has volunteered for special duty , sir .
That 's all .
Greg , what does he mean ?
It means your meeting with Alan will have to wait .
He 's volunteered for a duty of importance to the service .
- Is there any danger ?
- There 's always danger here .
I 'll make it my job to bring him back to you safe .
We 're in for a bit of a fuss .
I want you to remain here in quarters no matter what happens .
You promise ?
I promise .
Oh , but hurry back .
I 'm frightened .
Put a double sentry on this door !
- What are you walking like that for ?
- Well , the horse didn 't fit me .
Well , straighten up .
You 're going to meet royalty .
Salaam , sahib .
Colonel McGregor I welcome you and your staff to my humble home .
Be seated .
Colonel McGregor , would you and your staff join me in a pipe of friendship ?
Why , we certainly will .
Well , cheerio .
Remember , not a shot is to be fired until you get the word .
Carry on .
- Very good , sir .
- Very good , sir .
Throw down your arms and surrender !
Let the festivities proceed .
Would you pass the butter ?
Well ?
Good .
Very good .
Remove the food .
- What 's the idea ?
- The time for pleasure is done .
- What do you mean ?
- I mean that Fort Rannu is no more .
Your comrades are being wiped out .
And ere the sun sinks your bones will join theirs and lie bleaching in the desert wastes .
Get the boiling oil .
Prepare the rack .
- We 'll teach these dogs a lesson .
- You 'll not take us without a fight .
Seize him !
There is no escape .
Take those .
- What are these for ?
- You are to use those to blow your brains out .
- I never blew my brains out before .
- Take him away .
I don 't know what ...
I don 't know what to do .
- Goodbye , Ollie .
- Goodbye , Stanley .
I 'll see you later .
- I 'll be waiting when you get to heaven .
- Well , how will I know you ?
I 'll be waiting at the gate .
And I 'll have on wings and a harp in me hand .
Well , so will all the rest of the angels .
Well , I 'll keep me hat on , then you 'll know me .
Enough !
Enough of this nonsense .
Proceed , or I shall change my plans .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye , Stanley .
Remove the body .
- What happened ?
- I missed myself .
Well , I won 't miss .
- Khan Sahib !
Khan Sahib !
- Speak .
- Allah deserted us .
- What mean you ?
Disaster .
Colonel McGregor knew your plans .
He was there and captured all your warriors to the last man .
Colonel McGregor there ?
Then who are you ?
Why , I 'm Mr. Hardy .
This is my friend , Mr. McLaurel .
We thought we 'd come over and have ...
Seize them , men !
One more step and I 'll shoot !
Don 't point that at me .
There they are . Shoot !
The crudest , savage , exhibition of nature at her worst , without , and we three , we elegant three , within .
I should like to think that an irate Jehovah was pointing those arrows of lightning directly at my head .
The unbowed head of George Gordon , Lord Byron , England 's greatest sinner .
But I cannot flatter myself to that extent .
Possibly those thunders are for our dear Shelley .
Heaven 's applause for England 's greatest poet .
- What of my Mary ?
- She is an angel .
- You think so ?
You hear ?
Come , Mary .
Come and watch the storm .
You know how lightning alarms me .
Shelley , darling , will you please light these candles for me ?
Mary , darling .
Astonishing creature .
- I , Lord Byron ?
- Frightened of thunder , fearful of the dark .
And yet you have written a tale that sent my blood into icy creeps .
Look at her , Shelley .
Can you believe that lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein ?
A monster created from cadavers out of rifled graves .
- Isn 't it astonishing ?
- I don 't know why you should think so .
What do you expect ?
Such an audience needs something stronger than a pretty little love story .
So why shouldn 't I write of monsters ?
No wonder Murray 's refused to publish the book .
His public would be shocked .
It will be published , I think .
Then , darling , you will have much to answer for .
The publishers did not see that my purpose was to write a moral lesson of the punishment that befell a mortal man who dared to emulate God .
Whatever your purpose was , I take great relish in savouring each separate horror .
I roll them over on my tongue .
Don 't , Lord Byron .
Don 't remind me of it tonight .
What a setting in that churchyard to begin with !
The sobbing women , the first clod of earth o " n the coffin .
That was a pretty chill . "
Frankenstein and the dwarf stealing the body out of its new-made grave .
Cutting the hanged man down from the gallows , where he swung in the wind .
The cunning of Frankenstein in his mountain laboratory , picking dead men apart and building up a human monster so fearful and so horrible that only a half-crazed brain could have devised .
And then the murders , the little child who " drowned .
Henry Frankenstein himself thrown from the top of the burning mill by the very monster he had created .
And it was these fragile white fingers that penned the nightmare .
You 've made me prick myself , Byron .
It 's bleeding .
There , there . I do think it a shame , Mary , to end your story quite so suddenly .
That wasn 't the end at all .
Would you like to hear what happened after that ?
I feel like telling it .
It 's a perfect night for mystery and horror .
The air itself is filled with monsters .
I 'm all ears .
While heaven blasts the night without , open up your pits of hell .
Well , then , imagine yourselves standing by the wreckage of the mill .
The fire is dying down .
Soon the bare skeleton o " f the building rolls over , " the gaunt rafters against the sky .
Well , I must say , that 's the best fire I ever saw in all me life .
- What are you cryin ' for ?
- It 's terrible .
I know .
But after all them murders and poor Mr Henry being brought home to die ,
I 'm glad to see the monster roasted to death before my very eyes .
It 's too good for him .
It 's all the devil 's work , and you 'd better cross yourself quick before he gets you .
Come along , come along .
It 's all over .
Get back to your homes and go to sleep .
There it goes again .
It ain 't burnt out at all .
- There 's more yet .
- Isn 't the monster dead yet ?
It 's high time every decent man and wife was in bed .
That 's his insides caught at last .
Insides is always the last to be consumed .
Move on .
You 've had enough excitement for one night .
This strange man you call a monster is dead .
Monster , indeed !
You may thank your lucky stars they sent for me to safeguard life and property .
Why didn 't you safeguard those drownded and murdered ?
Come , now .
We want no rallying , no riots .
- Who 's rioting ' ?
- Move on , move on .
Good night all , and pleasant dreams .
Ah , pleasant dreams yourself .
Thinks he 's everybody just because he 's a burgomaster .
Poor Mr Henry .
He was to have been married today to that lovely girl Elizabeth .
Cover him up .
Someone must break the news to the poor girl .
Ride as fast as you can to the castle , and tell the old Baron Frankenstein we are bringing his son home .
- Oh , dear .
- Oh , shut up .
Come home , Hans .
The monster is dead now .
Nothing could be left alive in that furnace .
Why do you stay here ?
I want to see with my own eyes .
Oh , Hans , he must be dead .
And , dead or alive , nothing can bring our little Maria back to us .
If I can see his blackened bones , I can sleep at night .
Come back , Hans !
You will be burned yourself !
Maria drowned to death and you burned up !
What should I do then ?
No !
Where are you ?
Hans !
Are you all right ?
I hear you .
Here , give me your hand , Hans .
Here .
Oh , heaven , what is this ?
Henry ?
Tell me .
Oh , milady , how can we tell you ?
Bring him in .
- Albert .
- What do you want ?
It 's alive .
The monster , it 's alive !
- Ah , shut up , you old fool .
- I saw it .
It ain 't turned to no skeleton at all .
It lived right through the fire .
Ah , go bite your tongue off .
We don 't believe in ghosts .
Nobody 'll believe me .
All right , I 'll wash my hands of it .
Let ' em all be murdered in their beds .
- Speak to me , Henry .
- Oh , milady , he 'll never speak again .
I was foretold of this .
I was told beware my wedding night .
Oh , look , milady ! He 's alive !
Henry , darling .
Elizabeth .
Oh , what a terrible wedding night .
You can go to bed now , Mary .
- You 'll soon be better .
- I feel almost myself again .
When you 're strong enough , we 'll go away and forget this horrible experience .
Forget ?
If only I could forget .
But it 's never out of my mind .
I 've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life .
Perhaps death is sacred , and I 've profaned it .
For what a wonderful vision it was .
I dreamed of being the first to give to the world the secret that God is so jealous of .
The formula for life .
Think of the power to create a man .
And I did .
I did it .
I created a man .
And who knows ?
In time I could have trained him to do my will .
I could have bred a race . I might even have found the secret of eternal life .
Henry , don 't say those things .
Don 't think them .
It 's blasphemous and wicked .
We are not meant to know those things .
It may be that I 'm intended to know the secret of life .
It may be part of the divine plan .
No , no .
It 's the devil that prompts you .
It 's death , not life , that is in it all and at the end of it all .
Listen , while you 've been lying here , tossing in your delirium , I couldn 't sleep .
And when you rave of your insane desire to create living men from the dust of the dead , a strange apparition has seemed to appear in the room .
It comes , a figure like Death .
And each time it comes more clearly , nearer .
It seems to be reaching out for you , as if it would take you away from me !
There it is .
Look .
- There .
- I see nothing , Elizabeth .
Where ?
There 's nothing there .
There ! There !
It 's coming for you !
Nearer !
Henry !
Albert !
Drat the man .
He 's never here when he 's wanted .
- What 's the good of footmen anyway ?
All right . All right !
Don 't knock the castle over !
We 're not all dead yet .
- There 's nobody at home .
- Let me in , my good woman .
I know the young Baron Frankenstein is at home .
He 's sick .
He 's in his bed , where all decent folk should be at this time of night .
Tell him that Dr Pretorius is here on a secret matter of grave importance , and must see him alone , tonight .
Dr Pretorius ?
Pretorius ?
- What was it ?
What was the name ?
- Dr Pretorius .
There ain 't no such name .
Now , you stay there .
- Who 's there ?
- It 's Minnie , milady .
Oh , come in .
It 's Dr Pretorius .
He says he wants to see the master .
Most insistent .
Pretorius ?
He 's a very queer-looking old gentleman , sir .
And must see you , on a secret , grave matter , he said .
Tonight .
Alone .
- Bring him in .
- Henry , who is this man ?
Dr Pretorius .
Baron Frankenstein now , I believe ?
Won 't you come in , Doctor ?
I trust you will pardon this intrusion at so late an hour .
I would not have ventured to come , had I not a communication to make which I suspect may be of the utmost importance to yourself .
This is Professor Pretorius .
He used to be Doctor of Philosophy at the university .
- But , uh ...
- But was booted out .
Booted , my dear Baron , is the word .
For knowing too much .
Henry 's been very ill , Professor .
He shouldn 't be disturbed .
I am also a doctor , Baroness .
Why have you come here tonight ?
My business with you , Baron , is private .
Elizabeth , please .
I do hope he won 't upset Henry .
- What do you want ?
- We must work together .
Never .
This is outrageous .
I 'm through with it .
I 'll have no more of this hell-spawn .
As soon as I 'm well , I 'm to be married , and I 'm going away .
I must beg you to reconsider .
You know , do you not , that it is you , really , who are responsible for all those murders ?
There are penalties to pay for killing people .
And with your creature still at large in the countryside ...
Are you threatening me ?
Don 't put it so crudely .
I had ventured to hope that you and I together , no longer as master and pupil , but as fellow scientists , might probe the mysteries of life and death ...
Never .
No further .
... and reach a goal undreamed of by science .
I can 't make any further experiments .
I 've had a terrible lesson .
That is sad , very sad .
But you and I have gone too far to stop .
Nor can it be stopped so easily .
I also have continued with my experiments .
That is why I am here tonight .
You must see " my " creation .
Have you also succeeded in bringing life to the dead ?
If you , Herr Baron , will do me the honour of visiting my humble abode , I think you will be interested in what I have to show you .
After 20 years of secret scientific research , and countless failures , I also have created life , as we say , in God 's own image .
I must know .
When can I see it ?
I thought you might change your mind .
Why not tonight ?
It is not very late .
- Is it far ?
- No , but you will need a coat .
I think your coachman had better wait here .
Won 't you sit down , Herr Baron ?
Before I show you the results of my trifling experiments , I would like to drink to our partnership .
Do you like gin ?
It is my only weakness .
To a new world of gods and monsters .
Creation of life is enthralling , distinctly enthralling , is it not ?
I cannot account precisely for all that I am going to show you .
But perhaps now that you are my partner , you can .
My experiments did not turn out quite like yours , Henry .
But science , like love , has her little surprises , as you shall see .
Good heavens , Doctor .
What are these ?
There is a pleasing variety about my exhibits .
My first experiment was so lovely that we made her a queen .
Charming , don 't you think ?
Then , of course , we had to have a king .
Now he 's so madly in love with her that we have to segregate them .
Now now .
I have to be very careful with the king .
Now , behave .
My next production looked so disapprovingly at the other two that they made him an archbishop .
He seems to be asleep .
I must wake him up .
The next one is the very devil .
Very bizarre , this little chap .
There 's a certain resemblance to me , don 't you think ?
Or do I flatter myself ?
I took a great deal of pains with him .
Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn 't be much more amusing if we were all devils , and no nonsense about angels and being good .
Oh , there 's the king out again .
Even royal amours are a nuisance .
Poor Archbishop .
He has his hands full .
There .
That 'll keep you quiet .
My little ballerina is charming , but such a bore .
She 'll only dance to Mendelssohn 's " Spring Song " , and it gets so monotonous .
My next is very conventional , I 'm afraid .
But you can never tell how these things will turn out .
It was an experiment with seaweed .
Normal size has been my difficulty .
You did achieve size .
I need to work that out with you .
But this isn 't science .
It 's more like black magic .
You think I 'm mad .
Perhaps I am .
But listen , Henry Frankenstein , while you were digging in your graves piecing together dead tissues , I , my dear pupil , went for my material to the source of life .
I grew my creatures , like cultures .
Grew them as nature does , from seed .
But , still , you did achieve results that I have missed .
Now , think .
What a world-astounding collaboration we should be , you and I , together .
No . No , no , no .
Leave the charnel house and follow the lead of nature , or of God , if you like your Bible stories .
Male and female , created He them .
Be fruitful and multiply .
Create a race , a man-made race upon the face of the earth .
Why not ?
I daren 't . I daren 't even think of such a thing .
Our mad dream is only half realised .
Alone you have created a man .
Now together we will create his mate .
You mean ... ?
Yes , a woman .
That should be really interesting .
Please don 't touch me !
- There she is !
There he is .
Shoot .
Run to the village , quick .
It 's the monster .
Tell the burgomaster .
Raise all the men you can , lock the women indoors and wait for me . - What is it now ?
- The monster !
He 's in the woods .
Get the bloodhounds .
Now then !
Monster , indeed !
I 'll show him .
Follow me .
Where is he ?
Bind him securely .
I don 't want anything slipshod .
Tie his feet first .
His feet first !
I get no cooperation .
None at all .
Have you got him ?
That 's what I want to know .
Have you got him ?
Of course we 've got him , my good woman .
A good job too .
Mind he don 't get loose again .
He might do some damage and hurt somebody .
- Bring him down when you 've bound him .
- You want any help there ?
I 'll bind him !
Now take him down to the old dungeon and put him in chains .
There you are .
Find some rope and tie him up .
Come on , then .
Get back to your work .
Keep still .
That 's quite enough .
Come and lock your doors .
We can 't take all day over this .
I 'd hate to find him under my bed at night .
He 's a nightmare in the daylight , he is .
Get away , there !
Clear that window !
You mind your own business and see he doesn 't get out .
He 's dangerous .
Now I can get back to more important duties .
- Way past our hours . - Hm ?
- The night , sir .
- Monster , indeed .
Tush , tush .
He 's loose !
Shoot him !
Help !
He 's loose !
Go to your homes .
Just an escaped lunatic .
Merely wanted someone to handle it , that 's all .
Quite harmless .
Shoot him !
Why don 't you shoot him ?
Where 's Frieda ?
Frieda !
Frieda !
- Frieda ?
Where 's Frieda ? - She just left .
- Oh , look !
Frieda !
Oh , what have they done to you ?
Mrs Newman . Oh !
Come on !
- Poor old Newman .
- Where 's his wife , Frau Newman ?
Frau Newman .
- Frau Newman !
- Frau Newman !
Frau Newman !
There 's another one in there .
- Frau Newman .
Aurora , you stay close to me .
We 'd better get away from these parts .
- It isn 't safe .
- Why ?
I 'm frightened .
The monster .
Ah , there 's no danger .
He 's safe in jail and they 'll keep him there .
Where 's the pepper and salt ?
We got no pepper and salt .
All right , Mother .
I 'll get it .
Don 't worry .
You shall have your meat .
Get away from there .
Who 's there ?
Who is it ?
You 're welcome , my friend , whoever you are .
Who are you ?
I think you 're a stranger to me .
I cannot see you .
I cannot see anything .
You must please excuse me , but I am blind .
Come in , my poor friend .
No one will hurt you here .
If you 're in trouble , perhaps I can help you .
But you need not tell me about it if you don 't want to .
- What 's the matter ?
You 're hurt , my poor friend .
Come .
Sit down .
Now tell me , who are you ?
I don 't understand .
Can you not speak ?
It 's strange .
Perhaps ... perhaps you 're afflicted too .
I cannot see and you cannot speak .
Is that it ?
If you understand what I 'm saying , put your hand on my shoulder .
That is good .
No , you stay here .
I 'll get you some food .
We shall be friends .
I have prayed many times for God to send me a friend .
It 's very lonely here , and it 's been a long time since any human being came into this hut .
I shall look after you , and you will comfort me .
Now you must lie down , and go to sleep .
Yes , yes , now you must sleep .
Our Father , I thank thee , that , in thy great mercy , thou hast taken pity on my great loneliness .
And now , out of the silence of the night , hath brought two of thy lonely children together , and sent me a friend to be a light to mine eyes and a comfort in time of trouble .
Amen .
And now for our lesson . Remember , this is bread .
Bread .
Bread .
And this is wine ... to drink .
- Drink .
- Drink .
Good .
Good .
We are friends , you and I.
- Friends .
- Friends .
- Good .
- Good !
And now for a smoke .
No , no .
This is good .
Smoke .
You try .
Smoke .
Good , good .
Good .
Before you came , I was all alone .
It is bad to be alone .
Alone .
Bad .
Friend .
Good .
Friend .
Good .
Now , come here .
And what is this ?
This is wood for the fire .
Wood .
- And this is fire .
No , no . Fire is good .
Fire no good .
There is good and there is bad .
Good .
Bad .
Good .
Music ?
Can you tell us how to get out of this wood ?
We 've lost our way .
Come in , friends , and rest a while .
- Look .
- It 's the monster .
What are you doing ?
This is my friend .
Friend ?
This is the fiend that 's been murdering half the countryside .
Good heavens , man , can 't you see ?
Oh , he 's blind .
He isn 't human .
Frankenstein made him out of dead bodies .
My friend .
Why do you do this ?
Friend .
Look .
Which way did he go ?
This way !
He 's gone this way !
Friend .
- I can smell the ghosts already .
- I never could stand graves .
Shut up and follow me .
Read the inscription .
What does it say ?
" Died 1899 . Maddalena Ernestine , beloved daughter of ... "
Oh , never mind that .
How old was she ?
" Aged 19 years , three months . "
Well , that 's the one .
Get to work .
- What are you waiting for ?
- Mercy on us .
- You want me to send you to the gallows ?
- Could be no worse than this .
- Well , are you ready ?
- Yes .
Here goes .
Pretty little thing , in her way , wasn 't she ?
I hope her bones are firm .
- It seems lighter now .
- Yes .
Well , Doctor , I guess that 's all for tonight .
- Can we go home now ?
- Yes .
I shall wait here for a bit .
I rather like this place .
- Be careful nobody sees you leave .
- We know .
- And leave me that lantern down there .
- All right , all right .
If there 's more like this , what do you say , pal ?
We give ourselves up and let ' em hang us ?
- That goes for me too .
- This is no life for murderers .
I give you the monster .
Oh . I thought I was alone .
Good evening .
Smoke .
- Friend .
- Yes , I hope so .
Have a cigar .
They are my only weakness .
Good , good .
Drink .
Good .
Good .
You make man like me ?
No . Woman .
- Friend for you .
- Woman ?
Friend .
Yes .
I want friend .
Like me .
I think you can be very useful .
And you will add a little force to the argument , if necessary .
Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is ?
And who you are ?
Yes .
I know .
Made me from dead .
I love dead .
Hate living .
You 're wise in your generation .
We must have a long talk , and then I have an important call to make .
Woman .
Friend .
Wife .
That Dr Pretorius is here again , sir .
There , I knew it .
- Send him away .
I won 't see him .
- I certainly will .
Good evening , Henry .
Baroness , I 've not yet had the opportunity of offering you my congratulations on your marriage .
- Pray accept them now .
- Dr Pretorius .
I don 't know what your business is but , whatever it may be , I tell you frankly that I am not frightened of it or of you .
Henry 's been very ill .
He 's in no state to be alarmed or annoyed .
Your visit now is most unwelcome .
Henry , I heard the carriage drive up .
I 'll see that the baggage is put in .
Then we 're leaving .
I think you know why I am here , Henry .
All the necessary preparations are made .
My part in the experiments is complete .
I have created , by my method , a perfect human brain-already living , but dormant .
Everything is now ready for you and me to begin our supreme collaboration .
No , no .
Don 't tell me of it .
I don 't want to hear .
I 've changed my mind .
I won 't do it .
I expected this .
I thought we might need another assistant .
Perhaps " he " can persuade you .
- Nothing can persuade me .
- We shall see .
- No !
Not that !
- Oh , he 's harmless , except when crossed .
Frankenstein .
Yes , there have been developments since he came to me .
Sit down .
- What do you want ?
- You know .
- This is your work .
- Yes .
I 'll have no hand in such a monstrous thing .
- Yes . Must .
- Get him out .
I won 't even discuss it until he 's gone .
Go now .
Go .
- Must do it .
- Nothing can make me go on with it .
Now .
Put the bags in the carriage and I 'll be out in a moment .
Go and tell the master to hurry , Minnie , or we shall lose the train .
Excuse me for being so nervous , milady , but I don 't like leaving you alone .
- Oh , nonsense , Minnie , I shall be all right .
- I hope so , milady .
Is that you , Henry ?
Henry !
Henry , help !
Henry ! Milady !
- Elizabeth .
What is it ?
What 's the matter ?
Oh , sir , she 's gone !
The monster , he 's got her !
I saw it .
The baroness is gone !
This is Pretorius ' doing .
Quick , search parties .
There 's not a moment to lose .
I charge you , as you value your mistress ' life , to do nothing and say nothing of this episode .
I assure you that the baroness will be safely returned , if you will leave everything to me .
Nothing , that is , except what he demands .
I can find no trace of Elizabeth .
Oh , I admit I 'm beaten .
But if you can bring her back , I 'll do anything that you want .
Are you ready to complete with me this final experiment ?
- What about Elizabeth ?
- She is well , and will be safely returned if you will proceed .
- I 'm ready . - Ah .
Mind the steps .
They 're a bit slimy , I expect .
I think it 's a charming house .
It is interesting to think that once upon a time we should have been burnt at the stake as wizards for this experiment .
Doctor , I think the heart is beating .
Look .
It 's beating .
- But the rhythm of the beat is uneven .
- Increase the saline solution .
- Is there any life yet ?
- No , not life itself yet .
This is only the simulacrum of life .
This action only responds when the current is applied .
We must be patient .
The heart is more complex than any other part of the body .
Look .
The beat is increasing .
Yes ...
- It 's stopped .
- Shall I increase the current ?
This heart is useless .
I must have another .
And it must be sound and young .
Karl .
You must go to your friend at the accident hospital .
What we need is a female victim of sudden death .
Can you do it ?
If you promise me a thousand crowns .
It will be well worth it , and the baron will pay .
- Yes , yes .
Go and get it .
- I 'll try .
There are always accidental deaths occurring .
Always .
I 'll get your heart .
I 'll go into that room , I 'll go into that room and I 'll take my knife out .
I 'll get her .
I 'll hold her down and there she 'll be .
Where , I ask you ?
Where will she be ?
A thousand crowns .
It 's beating perfectly .
Just as in life .
- Oh , if only I can keep it going until ...
- It was a very fresh one .
Where did you get it ?
I gave the gendarme 50 crowns .
- What gendarme ?
- It was a ...
- police case .
- Yes , very sad .
Only , we can 't bother about that now .
Can I do anything ?
No , no , no !
I can work better alone .
- Work .
- Where 's Elizabeth ?
- Have you brought her ?
- She wait . I wait .
I 'm exhausted .
I must get sleep .
Work .
Finish .
Then sleep .
But I can 't work like this .
He must go away .
Send him away .
I 'll settle him for a little while .
Drink .
Drink .
Good .
That 'll keep you quiet .
Elizabeth-she 's dead .
Elizabeth is alive and she is well .
- I don 't believe you .
- I have proof .
- Proof ?
- In a few moments from now , she will speak to you from where she is through this electrical machine .
- Where is she ?
- Not far from here .
Speak , and she will hear you and answer .
Yes , yes , this is Henry .
Henry , yes , I 'm safe .
But , oh , Henry , how long ?
Come for me .
I 'm in ...
Elizabeth ?
Elizabeth !
- She 's gone .
- That is all now .
But you heard her .
Yes , she 's alive .
As soon as our work is completed she will be returned to you .
The heart is beating more regularly now .
Yes , it 's been beating for nine hours .
Not yet , but soon ...
- And the brain ?
- Perfect and already in position .
- Then we are almost ready .
- Almost .
Shall we put the heart in now ?
- Yes .
- Ludwig .
It 's beating quite normally now .
Bring it over .
- The storm is rising .
- All right .
The air is heavy with electricity .
It 's going to be a terrific storm .
We shall be ready .
Isn 't it amazing , Henry , that lying here within this cowl is an artificially developed human brain ?
Each cell , each convolution ready , waiting for life to come .
Look .
The storm is coming up over the mountains .
- It will be here soon .
- The kites .
Are the kites ready ?
- Yes .
- Send them up as soon as the wind rises .
- Hurry , hurry !
- The kites , the kites , get ' em ready .
Ludwig !
He wants the kites !
Stand back .
Careful on the roof !
The big diffuser !
Wires !
Slip down your wires !
All right .
Stop your winches .
I 'm coming up !
- Now , off with the kites !
- You take number two , Ludwig .
- Have you made your connections ?
- Yes .
Stand by !
Let go of number one !
Let her go !
It 's coming up !
- Go back . Go back down !
Go back !
No ! Get away !
Frankenstein !
Get away ! Get away !
Don 't come near me !
Get away !
Don 't !
No ! No !
Don 't ! Don 't !
Raise the cosmic diffuser .
Remove the diffuser bands .
She 's alive !
Alive !
The bride of Frankenstein .
Friend ?
Friend ?
- Stand back .
Stand back .
She hate me .
Like others .
- Look out !
The lever !
- Get away from that lever !
You 'll blow us all to atoms .
Henry !
Open the door !
Henry !
- Get back !
Get back !
- I won 't unless you come !
But I can 't leave them !
I can 't !
Yes , go !
You live !
Go !
You stay .
We belong dead .
Darling , darling .
Whoa !
Mush !
Now beat it !
Ali right , liii leave , if that 's the way you feel about it . But III leave like a gentleman .
Quiet , everybody !
Ladies and gentlemen , your attention , please !
You 're about to take your last look at Mr. Thornton 's handsome , smiling face .

The finest jailhouse 1 ever seen was the Coney Island precinct .
They sent you up for opening the maus , didn 't they ?
ShhI Shh !
That was a miscarriage ofjustice . '
Listen ... Ah !
Ali 1 did on that mail route was peek in a couple of those bill o ' dues .

Letters are supposed to be prívate , even up here .

Yeah .
Ifyou 'd have saved a bit of your bankroll , I 'd have cut you in on somethin

That letter 1 opened was worth about a million bucks .
Thanks very much for the snort-oIa See ya around sometime .
Hey , Shorty !
Shorty !
Wait a mínute
Let me hear a little more about that pipe dream of yours .
Pipe dream is right .

- Yeah ?
What do you need a bankroll for ?
dVeII , 1 ...
Hey , youse guys !
Get outta here !
23 skiddoo !
Boo !
1 need a bankroll to grubstake us as far as Dawson City andthenaIongwaybeyondthat
- Yeah ?
That sounds interesting .
- You know somethín ' ?
When they caught me opening those letters , and the judge presented me with six months , or , as the Englísh jockeys say , a dozen fortnights , well , thatjudge asked me a Iot of silly questions ,
like how many letters Id jimmied et cetera , et cetera , et cetera !
- But there 's one question he didn 't ask me .
- Yeah ?
He didn 't ask me what was in that Ietter.I
- Say , is your credít still good in there ?
- I wouldn 't be surprised .
- Come on .
Let 's go and exhaust ít .
- Okay .
His name was Blake .
Martin Blake.I
He had red whiskers and well , he was a little blind .
Oh , yeah , 1 remember .
He was cracked.I
- told everybody he 'd found a rích lode .
- That 's the guy .
well , he got síck on the trai
He was com ing to Dawson City to file hís claim .
He wrote a letter to his son , John Blake , in San Francisco .
He had a note on the envelope , 1 said if anything happened to him , the letter should be mailed .
well , his numberwas up , so the letter was mailed .
And you looked inside to be sure everything was neat and in order .
Mmm . But there wasnt much of a Ietter.I
It was mostly a map .

( LAUGHS ) Take off my boot .

1 got a good memory too .
Course , there 's a cou pie of things here 1 don 't quite figure out .
Now , you see ... 1 don 't know íf this is a mountain or a river.I
And 1 think they said there was rapids here .
But 1 don 't see how that could be because 1 don 't remember no river up there !
Hey , listen , little man , the graveyards up here is full of gold hopheads , guys that smoked a pípeful of hope had glittering yellow dreams and ended up under a pile of rocks in frozen ground .
Me , III take bourbon .

Now , wait a minute , Mr. Thornton.I
Something mighty strange happened today.I

Sit downl um standing out in front of the Palace Hotel , see .
Not dom ' nothin ' , because , well , you know , a fella just out of the can and broke , just lookin ' and standin' is about the limit of your activities .
Yeah
- well , it was a good idea , see .
- ' Cause things started happenin ' .
Yeah ?
Out of thís hotel comes the most beautíful skirt that you ever put your peepers on .
And following her is a dignified-Iookin ' guy I 'd say 46 autumns .
And him and her get in the sled and they go off , headed for Dawson City .
- Thanks for the society note .
- Yeah , butwait .
1 get excited , see , 1 run into the hotel and take a look at the ledger .
You know the names of these two ínteresting people ?

well , 1 don 't know about that.I
You don 't look like a man who knows much about anything , Mr. Groggíns .
well , 1 do know that people come up here don 't usually make a buggy ride out of it .
They walk or run wíth the dogs , sometimes break trail .
You sure will need more dogs 1 you 're gonna ride that sled .
And more dog food .
And a needle and thread .

Youre the only one we 've found so far .

We ran into trouble and we lost most of our provisions crossing the river .
The ice broke , and then some of our dogs died .
Two days ago my husband went out to look for food and he hasnt come back .
Do you think he 's dead ?
That 's a pretty good guess
What are we gonna do with her ?
What can you do ?
Take her to Dawson and leave her .
You 're forgetting one thing , pal .
Yeah ?
She and her old man was looking for the sarne thíng we are .
And they had the map , the original one .
youll find my husband for me , wont you ?
There 's nothing we can do .
We 're a thousand miles from nowhere .
Either the cold got him , or the wolves !
Get on the sled .
We 're taking you to Dawson .
But you gotta help me find him .
He isn 't dead . 1 don 't believe that .
Hey , listen , lady , in this country when a guy is gane for two days , hes gone .

Wait a minute , wait a minute .
Wait till 1 put on my pants .

May 1 ?
Yeah , sure .
They usually get along better1 when they do as they 're told.I 1 wouldn 't presume to teach you feminine psychology ,
- but 1 might add , very humbly of course ...
- Yeah ?
.that if a woman is asked to do something , she 's more apt to obey than when she 's commanded .
Are my stockings dry , Mr. Hocilhan ?

But how ?
How could you possibly know ?
Give me that map , Shorty .
SHORTY : Yeah .
Did you ever see this ?
Or , uh , something Iíke ít ?
Yes .
Yes , I 've seen the original .
This won 't do you any good .
It isn 't correct .
1 know it .
That 's why 1 was going to suggest that ...
My husband had to borrow and beg to make this trip .
He went through ali sor ( s of horrible difficulties and ... 1 know .
well , now hes gone .
That 's why 1 was going to suggest that .
And you were gonna take it away from him , steal it .
Oh , now , please be reasonable
Why don 't you come in with me and Shorty on this thing ?
Where our map is incorrect , give us the right route .
We 'II be partners .
And , well , while you 're about it , 1 suppose you may as weli consider ali angles .
We need your information about this .
We could probably find the mine ourselves without your help .
It would take longer .
Of course , you don 't know us very well except that we 're a little rough on women !
We might play you dirty .
We might take your informatior and then teu you to , well , go jump in the river .
We might do that .
On the other hand , we might be on the up-and-up with you .
Let me see your map .
This river here , it isn 't a river , its a dry creek .
- And that mountain peak , thaVs down here .
- Criminy !
That 's it !
- Hi ! - ( G ROAN S )
Ali the other mistakes are minor ones .
Ali right , Mr. Thornton , now you can teu me ...
How did you express it ?
To go jump in the river ?
We 've gotta do a Iot ofjumping ourselves to get the 700 bucks for the outfit .
- Seven hundred dollars is hard to get .
- My , oh , my , oh , my .
But we 'II get it , if we have to take a knife stick somebody and take it away from em .
Yeah !
- Come on , Shorty .
Mush !
- Come on .
Let 's go . - Ali set .
Keep your fingers crossed till we get back .
We 've gotta make a touch , Shorty .
Something that means more to me now that just finding a mine .
Yeah , 1 been noticing that .
Youre the doctor .
You know what 's good for ya .
The way 1 figures it , hunting for gold 's a fuli-time job .
Anything that interferes with it , interferes with ít .

You want to seu , maybe ?

Spit gold dust ? I
Hes the best dog you 've ever seen
He could pull that load of yours without any help at ali .
- Sure !
iii bet you he could .

How 'd you Iike to make a little bet on that , partner ?
Haven 't any money to bet .
1 hear of one dog in Nome , he pull 800 pound .
But he dies dead to do that .
Ah , no dog can pull 1,000 pounds .
It 's impossible .
well , then it 's impossible .
Let 's drop it . '
Is it ali right to look at him , mister ?
It aín 't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.I
Come on , boss .
Lets get outta herel
What 's the matter , gentlemen ?
If 1 overheard correctly , the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds .
I 'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can 't .
He won 't bet .
Says hes broke.I 1 don 't want money from you , my friend
If your dog is able to do it , lii give you the $ 1 , 000 .
- If he can 't ...
well ?
Why , then , lii take the dog
No .
MAN : Say , that sounds fair to me.I
Mister , you wouldn 't want to own a dog' that couldn 't pull a measly thousand pounds .
Sounds Iíke an easy way of making money to me .
Sure !
First he shoots off his mouth .
Then he won 't go through with it .
wen , my friend , these gentlemen seem to think I 'm giving you the best of it .
Don 't do it , boss .
Let 's go outta here .

- If Jack says his dog can do it , he can do it !
- Ten-to-one he can 't !
- It 's a bet !
- Any more takers ?

- I got a poke that says you 're wrong .
- Im right !
- But it dies dead to do that .
- The dog will do it !
Gee , boss , he can 't do it .
He 'II kill himselftrying .

- I mean exactly that .
Ali right , Shorty and 1 will stay here .
You go find the mine .

slow us down to a walk and make us carry double provisions .
Besides , it 's more of a risk than 1 want to see you take .
Believe me , that 's my only reason for making this decision .
If you don 't like my way of doing it , do it yourself .
You can have my share .
Oh , so you 're gonna give me my mine , are you ?
well , thank you very much .
You 'II not leave this town without me .
We 'II leave without you .
You 'II wait here and like it .
Ali right , come on .
Let 's get going .
- How about the iodine and quinine ?
- I 'II get them .
If that female iceberg comes out and wants to tag along , smack her down .
Wonderwhat 's happened now .
You know , 1 know a couplel of people used to fool around líke that and they got children now .
You , uh ... You still want to go along ?
Not only do 1 still want to go , 1 am going . '
Ali right , come on .
Let 's get going .
Mush !
Mush !
( WHISTLES ) Come on !

- What 's up , Sergeant ?
- They just brought a fellow in .
- Picked hím up on the Skagway Trail .
- What happened to hím ?
It seems like he left his sled togo hunting for food then couldn 't find hís way back . '
He was almost a corpse when they found him .
- What 's his name ?
- well , we found these on hím .
Name seems to be BIakeI John Blake , San Francisco .
Here it comesi
Say , it even looks like a raft !
Thanks . 1 always wanted to join the navy .
- will there be room for the dogs , sailor ?
- I 'm afraid not , matey .
- They 'II have to run along the bank .
- Verywell , sir .
Be careful of that varnish 1 on the deck , you two gobsi

CLA1RE : Ali set ?
Shove off , cabin boy.I
Ca . ..
SHORTY : Hard aport !
JACK : Come on , Buck .
Come on.I
The way 1 figure it , we go 100 miles upstream then we follow a creekj that runs into it northi ( LAUGHS ) NeverfaiIs .
Oh , you pretty things .
( CHUCKLES ) That 's right , north for about 40 míles.I
And then ali we gotta do is ... ( CHUCKLES )
Then ali we have to do is find the knoill upon which stands a tree half-shattered by lightning .
And the cabin .
Near that knoll .
Gee , 1 wonder what it 's gonna be líke , I havíng things ínstead ofwishing for ' em .
Hmm .
Not nearly so much fun .
You 're wrong , claire .
Wishing never got anybody anyplace .
It 's owning something that counts .
Taking it when you can 't get it any other way , that 's ali right too .
It 's the Iaw up here .
The law of the Klondike .
When there 's somethíng you need , grab it .
Take it away from the other guy .
It 's a good law .
It works .
Nope .
It only works when you deserve to have what you take .
Othervvíse it 's stealing .
Perhaps that particular commandment isn 't respected up here .
They all get broken .
- That one gets splintered' _ - ( CLAIRE CHUCKLES ) 1
well , Noah , that boat manipulating 's a Iittletoo tough for my delicate constitution , so if you don 't mmd , sir , 1 shall go below .
Good night .
- Night , Shorty .

Good night , dice .
Summer 's just around the corner .
( WHISPERING ) 1 can smell itj
You know , somehow Dawson and Skagway and even California seem like places I 've just heard of . 1
Seems as if Ive Iíved out here in this wílderness forever .
Other people and other places never existedi
But there 's one thing 1 do remember and that 's a very kind and wonderful man
1 wonder what Buck sees in the fire
What are you thinking of , Buck ?
well , hes probably remem bering more than thinking .
• Remembering back to the timel when he was more wolf than dog .
When there was only one law , the Iawwewerejusttalking about .
It 's getting late , Jack .
Think Ill say good night .
Not guilty , Your Honor .

You know , 1 been dreamin ' 1 of this moment ali my life . 1
( CHUCKLES ) I 'm sorry , Shorty , but you got to file a claím .
As long as the trails are open , some prospector is apt to discover this creek .
First to register gets discovery rights
You 're the boss , boss .
When 1 get to Dawson , first thing I 'm gonna do ...

- Get drunk.I
Not a chance .
I 'm gonna catch up on my meals .

1 Wolves .
That 's funny .
They don 't usually come so dose to camp .
Buck !
Come here !
Buck , come back here !
If that 's a pack , they 'II kill him Buck , come here !
JACK : Buck !
Hes been changing lately .
Haven 't you noticed ?
Seems as though he remembers things up here .
Buck , come back here !
Buck !
Buck !
Buck , come here !
well , well .
Welcome , stranger .
How are ya ?
Huh ?

Hey , hey , wait a minute .
You better come inside before you change your mmd .
Come on , tough guy .

Ali right , kid , shake it up .
Shake it up .

Yeah .
That 's grand music .
( CHUCKLING ) That 's lovely .
Come on .
Shake it up .
Ali right .
You tired ? Hmm ?
Ali right , come on now .
Let 's pull .
Together .
One , two ,
- three ...
- Oh !
( CHUCKLES ) well , we weren 't together .
- Oh , 1 wish you hadn 't .
- Why not ?
1 haven 't let myself think about us .
- I didn 't dare .
Why ?
Oh , 1 don 't know .
I ...
Ive had sort of a strange premonition .
1 don 't know exactly how to expiam it , but ...
Explanations belong 5,000 miles away .
1 only have one question , and 1 only want one answer .
You know the answer .
1 dont want to know the answer .
1 want lo have the answer .
Itjust struck me , Mr. blake
Now my back please , kali .
1 say , Mr. Blake , it 's just Istruck me that so far I 've taken this entire matter on trust .
1 believed your story and put up the money for this outfit .
1 still believe your story , but 1 think it 's time' you gave me a little more positive proof .
You should show us the map , Mr. blake .
When 1 asked you in Dawson City to help finance me 1 told you 1 knew the location of a very rich mine .
1 still know where that mine is .
I 'm taking you there .
But the map , Mr. blake ...
Why do you continually refuse to show us the map ?
1 see .
well , what 's to prevent our taking it away from you ?
The possibility that such a map may not exist , except in my memory .
Violence will do you no good'
You 've come this far and now there 's nothíng you can do but go ali the way .
You 'II gain nothing by killing me .
Now , now .
Who talked of killing ?
( CHUCKLES ) We 're not pirates , my dear man .
entieman adventurers ontheroad to great ríches , eh ?
( CHUCKLES ) Come , come , kali .
My towel
Say , Jack .
- Buck 's gone again .
- Yes , 1 know .
- I heard his lady friend howling last night .
well , that 's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company .
Wait a minute .
According to ali you told us , and to ali calculations , we should have located the mine two days ago .
I 'm afraid you 're bringing out my worst side , Mr. Blake .
- Yes , 1 know , but ...
- If you 're trying to hoodwink us , we are certain to find it out sooner ar later , I and if such is the case , there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you .
1 swear I 'm doing the best 1 can .
1 followed the compass directions exactly .
BLAKE : The burnt tree !
- The cabin !
That 's it !
- My dear Mr. Blake , how can you ever forgive me • for doubting your integrity ?
You 've placed me in a most embarrassing position .
1 scarcely know what to say . '
- One for the master . - ( CHUCKLES )
And one for the dame .
And one for the little boy who 's filíng the claím .
Why , Jack , 1 never suspected .
- The world doesn 't understand me . ( LUG HS )
At heart I 'm an artisti
Oh , 1 want to write poetry .
1 want to compose .
1 want to sing , paint .
Barns ?
- Yes , yes .
Those too .
1 want to starve in a garret .
Wear me hair long .
Get egg on a flowing tie .
In otherwords , be a genius .
Ah ... But no .
No , the world sneers at me talent , I and instead it gíves me gold .
Oh , my poor boy .
You seem to have all the comforts of home , Mr. Thornton ...
A comfortable cabin , golden evidence of more comforts to come , and a beautiful lady .
You will oblige me greatly if you wíll assist in makíng this incident as painless as possible .
Come on , get it over with .
What are you going to do ?
Do ?
My dear man , nothing at all .
The important thing is ...
Were going back by water , kali , using Mr. Thornton 's canoe .
You may destroy our burros
As 1 was saying , the important thing is to prevent you people from filing claim on this charming site before we do .
And how do you expect to do that ?
Oh , very easily , by leaving you here and destroying ali means of transportation .
- If you can 't get back to Dawson to file , why , then you cant get back to Dawson to file , now can you ?
So we 'll file insteadi
If you want to work the mine while we 're gone , you 're very welcome to do so , of course
We 'II be glad to recompense youl for your trouble when we get back
Meanwhile we 'II take with us your gun and ammunition , axes , et cetera .
It would be a grave error to leave behind the implements for building another canoe , wouldn 't it ?
KaIi !
Francois !
KaIi !
Come here !
Look here , Smith .
Why can 't we do busíness ?
I 'm always open to an honest proposition , Mr. Thornton .
We 'il give you the claim , ali of it .
You can have what gold we 've got . '
But leave us some way1 of getting out of here . 1
The winter snows are com ing on
My dear man , you cali that Ia business proposition ?
I We already have the mine , and the gold is ours by right of ...
How shall 1 put it ?
By right of conquest .
Do you mmd if we don 't argue the point anymore ?
Let 's help ourselves .
Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold .
1 must com mend your sense of humor , Mr. Thornton .
Very few people would be able to smíle on an occasion like thís .
- Thank you .
- Not at alll 1 remember watching a magician once . '
From an apparently empty hat he shortly produced a rabbit . 1
He smiled very much as you 're smilíng now because , 1 imagine , he knew ali the while that he had that rabbit up his sleeve !
Youve something up your sleeve , perhaps .
Perhaps
Roli up your sleeve , Mr. Thornton .
Thers no rabbít there .
Come , come .
Don 't let 's strain our friendship .
Madam .
Careful , you idíot .
You might have splít the bottom .
We 'II be back , my friends .
For the time being , good-bye and good-bye .
Look out !
well , they wanted gold .
Now they got it . '
Hey , Claire , get the medicíne kit and some hot water .
Is he badly hurt ?
Yeah .
Hes got a nasty crack on the skull !
Some prospector , 1 guess .
Go away , Buck .
Get out of the wayi
John !
John !
( WEEPING ) Oh , John .
John , darling !
Claíre , dearest , I 'd Iike to talk to Mr. Thorntoni
Ali right , dear .
1 thought I 'd lost you .
Try to rest , please .
Hes feeling much better this morning
He remembers everything , thank heaven .
It wasn 't so serious as we thought !
He wants to see you , Jack .
What are you going to say to him ?
1 wanted you and 1 took you with us .
well , I 'm keeping you .
Jack .
You know 1 love you , don 't you ?
You couldn 't doubt that , could you ?
well , he needs me .
You have your law and 1 have mine .
Best thing you can do , Blake , is to get out of here as quick as you can .
You need medical attention .
Take the canoe.I
It 's easy going now , but it won 't be when the heavy snows come on . 1
will you come with us ?
No , lii stay here and work the mine .
When you come back in the spring , we 'II divide what I 've found .
1 carne to say good-bye to Buck
He never would have forgiven me if I 'd forgotten that .
Would you , Buck ?
You could have skipped that .
Youre only making it tougher on everybody
Oh , Jack , put your arms around me .
well , I 'II be seeing you .
Yes .
You 'II be seeing me .
iii be seeíng you too .
Every day and every night and every minute .
This isnt the end .
It can 't be .
Careful of that first stretch of rapids .
After that ít 's clear sailing .
Good-bye , Thornton .
And God bless you .
Good-bye , blake .
Good-bye , Jack .
Good-bye , claire .
It 's hard to say no to that cali , isn 't it , Buck ? '
It 's ali right , boy .
Go ahead
Shorty ?
- Yeah 1
- Shortyl
- Helio , boss !
- ( LAUGHS ) Why , you old son of a gun .
You carne just in time .
You saved my Iife
Well , look at you .
You 're all dressed up .
Yeah .
Were in the money . 1 filed the claim .
We 're rich .
Richer than Astor 's pup !
No trouble at ali .
1 went right in and signed the names .
- Oh , and the claim was ...
- Shorty .
Whats that ?
That 's our new cook .
- Where 'd you get it ? - I won it in a crap game .
Dr. Blood !
Who is it ?
That we 'll know better when you 've opened the door .
Me ?
My mistake .
After I 've opened the door .
Open it , quick !
Why , Jeremy Pitt , isn 't it ?
It 's your friend , Lord Gildoy , wounded at Andrew Baynes ' farm by the river .
- The rash fool .
- He sent me for you .
No time to lose . Why , to be sure , I 'll lose none , nor my head either .
Come in and regain yours while I get my things .
- I 'll wait here .
- As you please .
Come , Mrs. Barlow , help me dress .
Jeremy , how was the battle ?
Battle ? Slaughter , rather !
What can clubs do against cannon ?
In case this business keeps me overlong , take care you water my geraniums ... especially those under the bedroom window .
Geraniums . Won 't you ever grow up ?
One would think you were still at medical school .
Geraniums !
You would think of geraniums ... when every other able-bodied man is out fighting .
It 's out of favor I seem to be with you , my vinegary virgin .
- Half the town is saying you 're a papist .
- Why ? Because I have the sense to sleep tonight instead of rushing to my ruin ... in an attempt to put this Duke of Monmouth on the throne ?
He 'd be even worse than King James .
Make haste with that cloak there , my pretty one .
And the other half of the town that defends you ... claims that you 're just a coward .
Mrs. Barlow , my darling , you can tell them , if you like ... that I 've been most anywhere that fighting was in evidence .
Fought for the French against the Spanish , and the Spanish against the French ... and I learned my seamanship in the Dutch Navy .
But having had adventure enough in six years to last me six lives ... I came here , hung up the sword , and picked up the lancet .
Became a man of peace and not of war .
A healer , not a slayer ... and that I am going to be as long as I 'm on top of the sod and not under it .
- Will you be back for breakfast ?
- Who knows , my pretty one ?
The worst is done , my friend . Give your mind peace .
The King 's men !
There 's nothing to fear .
This is a Christian country .
Christian men don 't make war on the wounded ... or those who shelter them .
I 'm Capt. Hobart of Col. Kirke 's dragoons .
What rebels do you harbor ?
No rebels .
This wounded gentleman- -
No need to ask how he came by his wounds .
A rebel .
Out with him .
This man can 't be moved without peril to his life .
Who the devil may you be ?
Peter Blood , Medicinae Baccalaureus .
Don 't fling your French at me .
Latin , my dull friend .
It means I 'm a doctor .
Or a liar .
If your wit were as big as your voice , it 's the great man you 'd be for this .
You may find me great enough to hang you !
Yes , I don 't doubt it .
You 've the looks and manners of a hangman .
Take him away , and the others , too !
" ln the name of His Majesty , Our Sovereign Lord ... " prisoners of the Crown , you stand indicted ... " for having maliciously and traitorously conspired ...
" of this Kingdom of England . " Therefore , you are charged with high treason ... " against the most illustrious and most excellent ...
" Prince James II by the grace of God ...
" of England , Scotland , France , and Ireland , King .
" Having no fear of God in your hearts ... " and being moved and seduced by the devil ... " you have failed in the love of due obedience toward the King ...
" Therefore , you are here to be tried before His Majesty 's Commissioner ... " the Lord Chief Justice , Baron Jeffreys of Wem ... " and by a jury of 12 good men and true . "
James Haynsworth , hold up your hand .
- Guilty or not guilty ?
- Guilty . - Harold Carron , guilty or not guilty ?
- Guilty .
- Andrew Baynes , guilty or not guilty ?
- Guilty .
- Jeremy Pitt , guilty or not guilty ?
- Guilty .
- John Wolverstone , guilty or not guilty ?
- Guilty . Uriah Ogle , guilty or not guilty ?
Guilty . Praise the Lord .
Henry Hagthorpe , guilty or not guilty ?
Guilty .
- Lord Chester Dyke , guilty or not guilty ?
- Guilty .
Peter Blood , guilty or not guilty ?
It 's entirely innocent , I am .
Take the stand and face His Lordship . Are you guilty or not guilty ?
You must use the right words .
Words , is it ?
Not guilty .
And speaking of words , I 'd like to say a few about the injustice ... of keeping an innocent man locked up for three months ... in such filth and heat and ill-feeding that my chief regret is I didn 't try ... to pull down the filthy fellow that sits on the throne .
Silence !
Are you entirely ignorant of the proper procedure of the court ?
Most happily ignorant up to now .
I could gladly have done without this acquaintance .
Enough of this .
There is nothing more to be said , except the passing of sentence .
May it please Your Lordship , but there 's a deal more to be said !
Silence !
- How now , fellow ?
- There is the little matter of my defense .
Very well , then ... but in heaven 's name , be brief , man .
We have much to do .
I am guilty of nothing , my lord ... unless it be adjudged a crime that a man try to live peaceably .
Living peaceably with the army of Monmouth ?
I was not with Monmouth 's army , my lord .
I was arrested while engaging in my profession as physician .
What 's this ?
You tell us you 're a doctor , you rogue ?
And as such was summoned to the aid of Lord Gildoy ... by Jeremy Pitt , who can so testify .
Master Pitt will testify .
He that is himself a confessed traitor .
- ls that your witness ?
- There is also Andrew Baynes .
Master Baynes will have enough testifying ... in a useless effort to keep his own neck from the halter .
I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater , the town where I live .
We 've no time for all this .
If these other traitors are as stubborn as you ... I may sit here till the next assizes .
Very well , then .
There 's a witness I 'll give you that you can 't deny :
yourself , sir .
For if I 'm not physician , how is it I know that you 're a dying man ?
The death to which you 're dooming hundreds of poor men daily ... in a frantic effort to send their souls to perdition before your own ... is a light pleasantry ... compared to the bleeding death in the lungs ... to which the great Judge has condemned you .
Now , fellow , we 'll be done with the witnesses ... and I will convict you out of your own rascally mouth .
When this Pitt came to summon you , as you claim ... did you know you were called to attend another rebel ?
My business was with his wounds , not his politics .
Did you know the law ... that any person who does knowingly receive , harbor , comfort ... or succor a rebel is as guilty as if he himself bore arms ?
I only knew my sacred duty as a physician .
Your sacred duty , rogue , is to your king !
I thought it was to my fellow man .
It 's a fearful thing to send a man 's soul to perdition ... but I am bound by my conscience ... and my love of my king to deal out justice .
Therefore , I instruct you , gentlemen of the jury ... that inasmuch as Peter Blood has admitted ... aiding a traitor to your king ... you do bring in a verdict of guilty ... that he may be hanged ... for the high treason he has committed .
What a creature must sit on the throne ... who lets a man like you deal out his justice .
- Your Majesty .
- Sunderland , what brings you here ?
These numerous hangings .
Splendid , aren 't they ? We kill the rebels , we kill the rebellion .
Very true , Your Majesty ... but a foolish waste of valuable human flesh .
How so ?
Your Majesty 's colonies in the West Indies are urgently in need of slaves .
A healthy , vigorous man can be reckoned worth from £ 10 to £ 20 .
Splendid , Sunderland .
Send out word immediately that the King is graciously pleased to command ... that all rebels convicted but not yet hanged ... be gathered together ... and shipped by the first available boats to the Americas .
Give us water !
There are men dying down here .
You 'd think they 'd take better care of a valuable cargo like us .
Ahoy , the deck !
Land sighted , Port Royal !
It 's a truly royal clemency we 're granted , my friends ... one well worthy of King James .
He spares us the mercifully quick extinction of the hangman 's rope ... and gives the slow death of slavery .
He grants us our lives in exchange for a living death .
It 's an uncertain world entirely .
" Be it known , men , that these prisoners who stand before you ...
" are now to be sold at a right and fitting price .
" They may be put to labor in the sulfur mines ...
" or on the plantations for a period of 10 years .
" And the parties to whom they are assigned ...
" must enter into security for the proper punishment ...
" of their offense . "
His Excellency , the Governor of Port Royal .
Guards , attention !
Present muskets .
Good day , Captain .
Lovely day , isn 't it ? Or is it ?
- Good day , Dixon .
- Good day , Governor .
I suppose we can begin this sale now , Governor .
No , better wait for Col. Bishop .
He has the privilege of being late for everything .
Yes , I know .
There he is .
- Good afternoon , Col. Bishop .
- Good afternoon , Governor .
Good afternoon , Miss Arabella .
How is my darling , the Governor , and his foot ?
Every day I think my gout can 't get any worse ... and every day it does .
My dear Colonel , according to the King 's request ... it is for you to take first choice of this dainty nosegay ... and at your own price .
Egad , they 're an appalling lot ... not likely to be of much value on the plantation .
The less you want , the more for Dixon .
- Dixon ? Uncle , I wish you 'd buy them all .
- Buy them all ?
To keep them out of Dixon 's hands .
I perceive somebody 's been talking behind my back ... telling the truth .
- And you can joke .
- Arabella dear , don 't be childish .
These men are rebels against their king .
They should be hanged , drawn , and quartered .
- Any fate they meet is too good for them .
- Your uncle is right . - Let the sale commence .
- My foot !
My dear , the law is the law , and it 's His Majesty 's law ... and must be obeyed .
The best of the lot .
Open your mouth .
- £ 20 .
- Sold ! Sold to Col. Bishop for £ 20 .
- As if he were buying horses .
- Yes , quite .
- This is Jeremy Pitt , ship 's pilot ... young and sturdy .
- Same price .
- Same price .
- Sold ! Sold to Col. Bishop for £ 20 .
Quiet !
Open your mouth .
His pride has bought him a ticket to Dixon 's mines .
He isn 't there yet .
- My dear , consider your social position ! - Uncle !
- Which one ?
- That one .
- Him ?
I will not . - But I want you to .
No .
Let him cool his head in Dixon 's mines . I 'll have none of him .
- £ 5 .
- £ 5 ?
That 's an insulting sum to offer .
- Does anyone offer more ?
£ 7 .
You 're making an exhibition of yourself ... a girl like you , bidding for a slave before these people .
- Will you buy him ?
- Certainly not . £ 8 .
When a lady 's interested in a man ... .
Calm down , Dixon , £ 8 is nothing for such a man ... a skilled physician , a gentleman , and a scholar .
- All right , £ 9 .
It 's apparent Miss Bishop wants him more than I do .
Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for £ 10 .
Sold !
£ 10 , sold .
What would you like done with him , Miss Bishop ?
Why , I don 't know .
You 're extremely foolish .
It might have cost you your life .
It was fortunate for you that I was here to save you .
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought by anyone by the name of Bishop .
You could learn a lesson in gratitude .
I could thank for not interfering .
As it happens , you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it .
You may join the others belonging to my uncle ... and henceforth you may take your orders from him .
Your very humble slave , Miss Bishop .
Come on .
Move on , there .
Last night , this dog attempted to escape .
Today you 'll see what happens to those who forget ... that my friend King James did you all a favor ... in saving you from your just fate on the gallows .
Show them the iron , Kent .
F-T .
Whoever wears that brand is known as a fugitive traitor ... and will be treated as such .
Burn those letters in your brain ... lest they be burned on your hides , too .
There speaks a fit friend for King James if ever I heard one .
Would I had him and his friend James roasting on a spit over that fire .
Great would be the burning thereof and loud the rejoicing in Heaven .
Do your duty !
What a cruel shame that any man is made to suffer so .
- This beastly gout !
- Perhaps a new dressing will help .
Perhaps .
- I have it here .
- Put it down . So sorry , Doctor .
Easy , you clumsy louts !
- We won 't hurt you , Governor .
- You thick-fingered jackasses !
His Excellency will have his little joke .
lll-begotten bunglers !
- Blundering pill peddlers !
- Your Excellency- -
That is the final straw .
Out of this house ... and never let me see your faces again .
- But think of our reputations .
- Hang your reputations !
Leave me !
I don 't want to see you again !
Away !
Out ! I don 't want to see you !
Out into the streets !
Stop shouting .
You brought on my headache again .
Good ! Hannibal , come take my crutch .
Easy , now .
Help me up with my foot .
No remedy .
Why , thank you , dear .
Why doesn 't His Excellency try another doctor ?
Another doctor ?
There are only those two on this wretched island ...
- and each one is worse than his partner .
- There is another .
And according to what I 've heard , he became a slave by being a doctor .
A slave ?
Would you elevate a slave to the position of doctor to the Governor ?
- ls he a good doctor ?
Why are you laughing ?
I 'm just thinking how annoyed Peter Blood would be ... if I did him another favor .
Your Excellency , there are diverse citizens of this sovereign island ... who come before you with complaints .
Complaints , complaints .
Can none of my citizens follow the example of their governor ... who endures the utmost agony without a murmur ?
- Easy there , fellow .
- Did I hurt you , sir ?
No , but I thought you were going to .
Your Excellency , this vagrant hides his sins ... behind the name of Honesty Nuttall .
- He 's charged with being in debt .
- State your case , fellow , and no lies .
I was on the way to pay the butcher on Tuesday ... as Honesty Nuttall is my name , when I chanced on a poor old beggar .
It was Jones from the grog shop ... who begged me to have a drink with him .
Try standing on it , Your Honor .
Stand on that bundle of pain ?
Impossible .
I remembered in time my poor starving wife in need of the five bob .
What is this all about ?
Silence !
- Sit down .
- What 's he here for ?
For debt , Your Excellency , and the prevaricator- - lf it 's for debt , don 't annoy me with such petty things .
Order him to work it off .
Work ?
Not that , anything but work .
What 's your trade ?
I 'm a ship 's carpenter when the painful necessity arises .
Take him to work on the docks ... and don 't you attempt to escape till every farthing 's paid ... or I 'll stretch your hide on the rack !
How could a debtor escape from this island ... even if he had a boat to do it with ? Escape ?
I couldn 't escape any more than a slave could escape .
I can walk .
Wonderful , my dear fellow .
Only two months ' treatment , and I 'm a well man .
It 's a miracle .
- The next complaint- -
- Drat the next complaint .
I can walk . Come , Doctor .
You 'll get your reward for this , Peter Blood .
- From now on , you 're my physician .
- Your Excellency is too kind .
Come back early tomorrow . You 're always welcome , Dr. Blood .
Hello .
Don 't I know you ?
A lady should know her own property .
- My property ?
- Let me refresh your memory .
My name is Peter Blood , and I 'm worth precisely £ 10 .
Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. Blood .
You 're so changed ... for the better .
The Governor tells me I have you to thank for that .
You don 't sound very grateful , Dr. Blood .
Do you think I 'd be grateful for an easy life when my friends are treated like animals ?
It 's they deserve your favors , not I. They 're all honest rebels .
I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free England ... from an unclean tyrant .
I believe you 're talking treason .
I hope I 'm not obscure .
- You could be flogged for that .
- No .
The Governor would never allow it .
He has the gout . You depend upon that ?
I intend to , for all it 's worth , and that promises to be considerable .
But you 'd hardly know about that .
You 've probably never had the gout .
- Good afternoon , Miss Bishop . - Good afternoon .
15-2 , 15-4 , and a pair are six .
- Another ?
- What else is there to do ... ever since you ruined the Governor 's foot and our reputations with it ?
- I ruined the Governor 's foot ?
- I tell you , Doctor , you 're methods are- -
- Someone coming .
- A patient ? A patient !
- I beg your pardon , Doctor . I 'm so sorry .
- lt 's all right .
Come in .
Good afternoon , colleagues .
Dr. Bronson .
- Dr . Whacker .
- Good afternoon .
How 's business , my friends ?
- Terrible .
- Good .
- Terribly good . - That relieves me .
I had heard that things were not altogether ... . ldle gossip , obviously .
You intend to remain here ?
Remain here ?
Why not ?
It 's queer .
There are you , free to come and go as you please , and you choose to stay here .
While I , who hate this pestilential island ... .
Such are the quirks of circumstance .
I must be running along , gentlemen .
Good day , gentlemen .
It 's pleasant to see everything so prosperous with you here .
- Not so hasty .
- Just a moment .
There 's something I 'd like to ask you .
Well , gentlemen ?
Have you been thinking of leaving us , Doctor ?
Leaving ?
Now , Doctor .
How could a slave think of leaving ?
Or even if he were fool enough to try , by what means could he hope to escape ?
And where , for example , could he raise the few pounds necessary ... to purchase even a small boat ?
- We might supply it .
- Now , gentlemen .
- Now , let 's talk this thing over .
Now , if you 'll just sit down here .
Now then , how much will you need ?
£ 20 might buy a small wherry , £ 10 more might equip it .
He 's right .
- He means- -
- You needn 't tell me what he means .
I know two Christian gentlemen when I see them .
Two men whose hearts are bleeding for a brother doctor in distress .
But it 's too much to ask , too noble a gesture to hope for .
No , my good man , not at all .
But who would buy the boat ?
We would not dare , and you , a slave , you could not .
True .
That would be my part .
To find someone . A man as eager to escape as I.
- A man held here for debt , say .
- Then it 's a bargain ?
Gentlemen , you 've opened for me the gates of hope .
Doctor .
- My dear colleague .
- Gentlemen .
Now we have him .
We 've only to get him involved and reveal his plan .
He 'll steal very little of our business when he 's in irons .
Gentlemen .
There 's one thing slipped my mind entirely .
Simple-minded men might think this an opportunity for trickery ... but brilliant men like yourselves will remember in what favor I stand ... with the Governor in contrast to some others ... and how little their words would weigh against mine .
Heigh-ho for the Governor 's foot !
Good day , gentlemen .
- Are you all with me ?
- Yes . Listen .
There 's a man named Nuttall who 's in trouble with the Governor .
He 's looking for a small boat which he 'll purchase ... on the night chosen for our escape .
- Escape ?
- Quiet !
While he gathers stores and equipment , we must be ready on the inside .
We might steal some sugarcane knives and hack through the stockade walls .
Or dig our way under .
Once at sea , if we get there , our troubles will have just begun .
If any of you want to withdraw , now 's the time .
- No . - Not me .
You 'll be a lubber crew , but I 'll match your hearts against any other .
We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt . He was a ship 's pilot .
Here 's one you won 't have to teach .
Six years in King James ' Navy .
- What ?
- That 's nothing .
I was a blooming gunner .
- A gunner ? - ln the King 's Navy , too .
I was always ashamed of it up to now .
We 'll have a crew yet !
Any of you others been keeping such secrets ?
Where 's Baynes ?
- Where is he ?
- He tried to escape today .
No ! Caught ?
- Branded ?
- Yeah .
No !
Why did you do it , Andy ?
I told you I 'd try to get you out .
I couldn 't stand it any longer .
I couldn 't stand it .
I was going mad .
What do you think a man is made of ?
How much do you think he can stand ?
" Watchman , what of the night ? " Isaiah 21 : 1 1 .
Don 't make the purchase until well on in the evening .
That way there 'll be less risk ... of anyone wondering where you came by the money .
Lumme , Captain . It ain 't too late for us to change our minds .
Stow the provisions away on board as soon as it 's dark .
Then all you 've got to do is sit down here and wait for us .
Wait all alone in the blooming dark ... waiting for someone to come along and nab me . Nuttall , my lad , there 's just one other little thing .
Could you find me a good piece of timber about so thick and so long ?
Yes , I think so .
Then do so and lash it to your spine .
It needs stiffening .
Courage .
I 'll join you at midnight .
How long does it take to feed this pack of dogs ?
It 's a wonder we make a profit at all .
You don 't drive them hard enough .
Get them out of here !
I 've just been with Nuttall at the boat .
It 's tonight .
- At last !
- For heaven 's sake , command yourself .
- Tonight , Hagthorpe .
- Caution above everything .
He who goes slowly , goes safely .
Remember , Jeremy , you 're the only navigator among us .
Without you , there 's no escape .
Hello , Uncle !
Riding again ?
What do you plan to see riding always the same road ?
You 'd be surprised what interesting things there are to see on this island ... if you only keep your eyes open .
Today , for instance , I saw something that you 'd give 1,000 ducats to know .
Stores and equipment are all stowed away onboard .
We could use more food , but there 's no money left .
I 'm not taking any chances by asking our medical friends for more .
I told Nuttall we 'd get to the boat by midnight .
Jeremy , we must not fail tonight .
What the devil have you been up to ?
Tonight will be a fine night , judging by the sky .
There you are , Pitt .
Keep it covered up and it should heal in a day or so .
Miss Bishop .
You looking for me , sir ?
Yes . You , stop !
What 's the matter ?
Nothing. I ... .
What 's going on between you two ?
Why , nothing .
The man has a bad leg .
I 'll tend to you later .
Where have you been ?
I 've been at my work , attending to the Governor .
You lie .
Do I ?
The Governor 's had another attack of gout .
He 's been screaming for you like a wounded horse all the afternoon .
Then it appears I was not with the Governor .
Then where have you been ?
- Why , I 've been at ... .
- He was with me , Uncle .
What ? Thank you for protecting my reputation , Dr. Blood , but it was a useless gallantry .
My uncle knows that I spend my time with whomever I please .
You might choose your company with better taste .
His Excellency 's waiting for you !
Here , Kent , lend him your horse .
Yes , sir .
Otherwise , the lout will be all night getting there .
Will I be required there long , sir ?
You 're afraid your work will interfere with your social affairs ?
If I get back late , before midnight , could I get back into the stockade ?
Will you stay here talking all night ?
Be off with you !
Take him to the stockade !
Go on , get along in there .
If he talks , we 're lost .
Well ?
It seems that you 're continually doing me favors .
- I don 't know why .
- Neither do I.
Yes , I do .
It 's because you 're so very grateful and always thank me so prettily .
Sure now , you don 't blame me for resenting you and your favors .
I 've had men tell me they had reasons for admiring me ... and some have even laid claims to reasons for loving me ... but for a man to store up reasons for resenting me , how refreshing . You must tell me a few of them .
The first is reason enough .
You bought me .
I 've had no lack of experiences in my time , but to be bought and sold was a new one .
I was in no mood to thank my purchaser .
That I can understand .
Go on .
I 've resented you because your name is Bishop .
My thoughts have lumped you with your uncle .
How was I to know that a devil could have ... .
That a devil could have an angel for a niece ?
From a resentful man , that is a pretty fair compliment .
Have you any more reasons for resenting me like that one ?
Indeed , I have .
And the strongest of all ... I 've resented you because you 're beautiful , and I 'm a slave .
Do you understand that ?
I don 't know .
Perhaps if you were to explain further , I ... .
I 've already talked too much .
I 'll open your mouth !
You 'll stay here without food or water until you talk .
- Why did you lie to your uncle ? - Because ... .
Dr. Blood , you 're a physician and should know .
ls it not considered unhealthy for a slave to be seen at a boat ?
- Why should it be ?
- Boats put out to sea .
Slaves may not .
You 're jumping to conclusions , aren 't you ?
Am I ?
The Governor will be waiting for you .
Yes .
Miss Bishop , it 's difficult for an Irishman to apologize .
But I hope you can forgive me for having thought badly of you .
I will , if you tell me how you think of me now .
How I think of you now ?
I think of you ... .
I think of you as the woman who owns me .
Her slave .
But I think the man is lucky who can count you his friend .
I think you know you can .
Your slave is grateful for all marks of favor .
When you forget your slavery and go so far- -
Now there , you 're mistaken .
However far this slave may go , he won 't forget .
It 's a characteristic we Irish have in common with the elephants .
Hello . Where are you going ?
You 're so much improved , I was returning to the stockade .
Don 't leave me tonight .
I 'm a sick man .
I assure you , sir , there 's nothing more I can do .
There must be something .
Perhaps you ought to bleed me again .
Very well , then , if you wish it .
But mind , no more softness about this .
I 'm gonna have you well by midnight if I have to bleed you to death .
- Who goes there ?
- Peter Blood .
- Jeremy , what 's happened ?
- Water .
Easy , lad .
I didn 't tell him .
I didn 't .
- Tell him what , Jeremy ?
- About our plans .
My back .
Help me .
- Who did this ?
- Bishop .
Bishop .
Swine !
I didn 't tell him .
I didn 't .
- ls our boat still standing in at the bay ?
- Yes , Jeremy .
I wondered if I was still out of my mind .
I 've been seeing boats sailing in and out ... in and out , but ours will never sail .
Not now .
Or if it does , you 'll sail without me .
What ?
And get lost at sea without our navigator ?
- Nonsense , lad .
- We are not going this time .
It 's hopeless for all of us .
We 'll manage somehow .
- What are you doing here ?
- Doing ?
Why , the duties of my office .
I said he was to have no food nor drink till I ordered .
Sure now , I never heard you .
How could you ?
You weren 't here .
Then how do you expect me to know what orders you 've given ?
ln the name of humanity !
If you know the word .
- You dare take that tone with me ? - Yes , I do !
I 've been too soft with you ... but that shall be mended .
Kent , tie him up !
Had it easy here up to now . Get up there .
Now I 'll take this rod to you ... until there 's not an inch of hide left on your dirty carcass .
Another beating ?
This will be a good half-dozen of them you 've given me in promise .
This will be as real as it is overdue .
And what becomes of His Excellency the Governor 's gouty foot ?
You 'll not save yourself with that device this time .
Nothing will save you .
Pirates !
Spanish pirates !
This is what I call a timely interruption .
Though what will come of it , the devil himself only knows .
We 've got to get through the town to get to the boat .
Wait here , lads .
It 's me .
Mr. Nuttall .
You came close to being the ex-Mr .
Nuttall . Wouldn 't be the first death I died today .
We can 't stay here waiting for them to catch sight of us .
Let 's get to the boat down this way .
Sunk to the bottom of the briny .
And it sunk our hopes with it .
- Perhaps not .
- What do you mean , Peter ?
- He 's gonna take a bath ?
- Yes , but not for cleanliness .
Since the Spaniards have been thoughtless enough to sink our craft ... I 'll see if I can 't persuade them to lend us one of theirs .
Your Excellency , facts are so often dull and deplorable .
Nevertheless , at the risk of boring you ... it is my painful duty to inform you that 250 of my men ... are now complete masters of the town of Port Royal .
Your most worthy islanders have been disarmed ... and your city is now absolutely in the hands ... of the forces of His Majesty King Philip of Spain .
Now that you have our city , what do you want with it ?
For a price , I could forebear reducing it to ashes .
- What price ?
- 200,000 pieces of eight .
200,000 pieces of eight ?
That 's why we waited till this morning to put to sea .
We 've a message for those Spaniards .
They are on their way now to receive it .
- Hagthorpe , man the guns ! - Clear deck !
- All ready , Hagthorpe ?
- Aye , Peter , ready .
Give them a taste of their own iron !
You 've done it , Hagthorpe !
Hurrah !
Didn 't I tell you I was a gunner , sir ?
You did that , you son of a Yorkshire steer ... and bless your rusty heart , it 's a gunner you are !
It 's the Governor .
It must be that some brave party of citizens captured the ship .
I think you 're right .
Someone should go aboard and congratulate them .
Yes .
My foot .
Since your gout so unhappily prevents you , allow me to be the one .
Go ahead .
You 've always wanted to be governor anyway .
Don 't be nervous .
- Man those sweeps .
- Aye , sir .
- Shall we hoist anchor , Peter ? - Aye . Get under way .
There 's another boat approaching .
It looks like Col. Bishop .
- Who ?
- Bishop .
The fool would come blundering in just now .
- I 'll make short work of him .
- No , Hagthorpe , none of that .
But ... .
Who ... .
Welcome aboard the Cinco Lagos , Colonel darling .
You ?
Was it ... .
Peter Blood , was it you , then , who took this ship and turned defeat into victory ?
Myself it was .
Myself and these , my friends . And your friends .
And you saved my money , too !
- Yes , it was heroic .
- Heroic , is it ?
It was epic .
You amaze me .
On my soul , you deserve well .
You all deserve well .
- You shall find me grateful .
- How grateful ?
I shall ask His Excellency to write home to the King an account of your exploit .
Perhaps some of your sentencing shall be remitted .
That 's just about what we expected from you .
Now , Wolf , Col. Bishop has a kind heart .
- But what kind , I 'd hate to say .
- What is this ?
Why , Colonel darling , such unusual generosity from you ... must be making you feel unwell .
- As your physician , I 'd prescribe- -
- A bit of neck-stretching .
Lads , we shouldn 't hang this man .
- No ?
- No .
Tie him over the end of a gun !
I 'll scatter his innards all over the sugarcane field .
You 're wasting words , I say . Hang him !
Wait , lads .
Hanging 's too dignified for him .
Can you swim , Colonel darling ?
We 're giving you the chance to cool off some of that excessive heat of yours .
Over the side with him , men !
One , two ... three !
Peter Blood , I 'll make you pay for this ... if I spend the rest of my life doing it !
And then the whale came , and the whale swallowed Jonah . I hope .
Goodbye , Jonah . Don 't forget to write .
What 's the next move , Peter ?
Up anchor !
Wolf , man the capstan bar .
Hagthorpe , get the sails aloft .
Thomas , get those men over here .
Round you go , men !
That 's no water wheel you 're working .
- Can you handle it , Jeremy ?
- Aye , aye , Peter .
We sail .
Hard to starboard .
Up that rigging , you monkeys , aloft !
There 's no chains to hold you now !
Break out those sails ... and watch them fill with the wind that 's carrying us all to freedom .
We , the undersigned ... are men without a country ... outlaws in our own land , and homeless outcasts in any other .
Desperate men , we go to seek a desperate fortune .
Therefore , we do here and now band ourselves ... into a brotherhood of buccaneers ... to practice the trade of piracy on the high seas .
We , the hunted , will now hunt !
To that end , we enter into the following articles of agreement .
First ... we pledge ourselves to be bound together as brothers ... in a life-and-death friendship ... sharing alike in fortune and in trouble .
Second article .
All moneys and valuables which may come into our possession ... shall be lumped together into a common fund ... and from this fund shall first be taken the money ... to fit , rig , and provision the ship .
After that , the recompense each will receive who is wounded as follows :
For the loss of a right arm , 600 pieces of eight .
Left arm , 500 .
For the loss of a right leg , 500 .
Left leg , 400 .
A fellow can get rich if he 's lucky .
Greedy .
If a man conceal any treasure captured ... or fail to place it in the general fund , he shall be marooned .
Set ashore on a deserted isle ... and there left with a bottle of water , a loaf of bread ... and a pistol with one load .
If a man shall be drunk on duty , he shall receive the same fate .
And if a man shall molest a woman captive against her will ... he , too , shall receive the same punishment .
These articles entered into , this 20th day of June , in the year 1687 .
Now , men , you 've heard the agreement .
It 's the world against us and us against the world .
" His hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him . "
Genesis 16 : 12 .
Those of you in favor of these articles , raise your right hands and say aye !
Aye !
Blood !
This impertinent , ungoverned rascal must be eradicated .
Yes , Your Majesty .
Sinking Spanish ships causes me enough embarrassment ...
- but he sinks English ships as well .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it ?
He does his best , but conditions on the island- -
Silence , Willoughby !
I 'm not interested in anything you have to say .
I know your feelings towards me .
Sunderland , what are you Secretary of State for ?
Have you no solution ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Get your head off that hinge . Speak up .
Since Gov. Steed is incapable , you should appoint a stronger man .
Who ?
Col. Bishop assures me that if he were in power ... he would not rest day or night ... until this Capt. Blood was swinging on execution dock .
Angling for the office , is he ?
What difference if he 's the iron man we need ?
Draw up the appointment .
I 've already taken the liberty of doing so , Your Majesty .
Mrs. Steed , Mr. Steed , I wish you both a pleasant journey .
I thank you , Governor .
Again , congratulations , Gov. Bishop .
- May your term of office be successful .
- Thank you , my friend .
Arabella dear , have a nice holiday in England .
I 'm sure I shall .
- Captain . - Yes , sir .
- Keep a weather eye open for pirates .
- Very well , sir .
Before you return , Arabella , I shall have the sea swept clean of them .
Particularly one . I think you know whom I mean .
I hope he gets the gout the infernal office gave me .
Come along .
Goodbye .
Thomas Fulton .
One share , no injuries .
James Graham .
One share , plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound .
Zachary Stevens . For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo ... one share , plus £ 10 of silver .
Oliver Clark .
One share , plus 400 pieces of eight for the loss of his left leg .
There you are , Oliver , I 'm proud of you .
Lord Chester Dyke .
No injury , one share and £ 5 of silver .
Anton Brazilimo .
Andrew Fell .
One share , plus 500 pieces of eight for the loss of his left arm .
There you are , Andrew , and good luck .
David Sampson .
One share , no injuries .
Honesty Nuttall .
No injuries , one share .
Hold on , Captain .
How about me little toe , heroically sacrificed in battle ?
Honesty Nuttall .
One share , and nothing for the toe he just shot off himself .
You stupid numskull .
You should have shot out your brains and left your toe for thinking with .
Ahoy , the deck !
An English ship on the port bow !
So it is .
A fine big ship , too , as far as I can judge from this distance .
Shall we sail over and give them a surprise ?
No , Peter .
The men are set on putting in at Tortuga .
Their gold 's burning holes in their pockets .
What 's one ship more or less to us now ?
It appears I have a mutiny on my hands .
What ho , the deck !
A ship to starboard !
It may be a pirate !
Sail on , little ship , back to England ... where we may never go . Very well , then .
You 'll never know how close you came to not getting there .
Your turn , mon capitaine .
Up !
It 's your turn now .
Again , my captain .
- Are you ready ?
- Right .
It 's good .
This time , my friend , huh ?
- You missed .
- No .
I am defeated .
You win the prize , Capt. Blood .
- Goodbye , my dear .
- Goodbye .
What a charming captain .
Some other time , perhaps .
Why ?
What sort of a man are you ?
I 'm the sort of man you like , my dear .
A man with money .
The money !
Mon capitaine , what a pair we would make .
ln all the Caribbean , there is no buccaneer so strong as me .
Except you .
You almost flatter me , Levasseur .
Why do you hold off your consent so long ?
We become partners .
You 've been in Tortuga these three , four months .
You must be even so much in need of gold as I.
Such a partnership requires sober thought .
My poor head has been dancing with rum this whole week past .
Even so drunk , your brain is the greatest this side the Caribbean .
With your brain and my strength , there is nothing we cannot do .
There 's very little I can 't do all by myself .
Long live Capt. Levasseur !
And here 's to Capt. Blood !
Hurrah !
Then , it 's a good dinner guest , my friend .
- You 're next , Peter .
- Mon capitaine .
It 's clearly understood , then , that we sail under my articles .
Those very severe articles of yours ?
Mais oui , I sail under the articles of a girls ' séminaire ... to have you as my partner , mon capitaine .
Women will be the death of you yet , Levasseur .
It is a very pleasant way to die , even if it is expensive .
What is the first order , mon capitaine partner ?
We sail on the tide .
Outside the harbor , we 'll scatter .
Each ship will proceed singly to pick up any stray ships we 'll find on the journey .
We 'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra .
Magnifique !
I give you the toast .
To our great success !
Let me give one .
To the greatest captain on the Caribbean !
- Oui !
To Capitaine Levasseur !
- Capt . Blood .
Bravo !
The articles aside , let 's give a toast to Capt. Blood .
Capitaine Levasseur .
To the greatest captain on the coast .
The greatest captain on the coast , is it ?
Methinks the greatest captain on the coast ... has just made the greatest mistake ... the most ordinary common fool could make .
It 's been so lovely .
I 'd like to stay forever .
You 've all been so kind .
Come again and visit us soon , dear .
England is so much more beautiful when you 're here .
- Thank you .
Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
- Thank you for everything .
- Goodbye , dear .
- Goodbye , Amelia . - Goodbye , Mary .
However else the court may have changed , the art of flattery still flourishes .
Stab me if it 's flattery .
When the King ordered me on this journey as a special emissary to the West Indies ... I looked forward with some trepidation to a life among the savages .
But when I found you were one of those savages ... returning to your native heath , my grateful eyes could hardly believe it .
You pictured us running around in animal skins , eating raw meat ?
Why not , in a country filled with Indians and pirates ?
Speaking of pirates , did you ever happen to hear of a wild rogue named Blood ?
- Peter Blood ? - Yes .
No .
I don 't know him .
I hardly number pirates among my acquaintances .
Of course not .
Stupid of me .
I merely mention him in passing .
Because he 's one of the objects of my mission .
- Your mission ?
- Yes . I 've been sent to try to blot out all this piracy , my dear .
And in a manner I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood .
Ship on the port side , sir !
Yes , that 's a fine ship .
- Captain , what ship is that ?
- I don 't know , Lord Willoughby .
She flies the French flag .
She could be anything in these waters .
- We 're in pirate waters now , aren 't we ?
- Yes , we are .
Yonder bank of low clouds is the island of Virgen Magra .
- Exciting , isn 't it ?
- Very .
Could she be a pirate ship , by any chance ?
Any ship we meet in the Caribbean could be a pirate ship .
Ahoy , English ship off port side !
Prepare to come onto starboard tack !
Starboard tack it is !
Steady at the helm !
Ready ?
Stand by your guns .
What luck .
Just as I 'm about to give up and anchor to wait for my partner , Capt. Blood ... this fine English prize walks into my parlor and says :
" hello , Capt. Levasseur . "
- We 've got to give welcome , Cahusac . - Yes , and how .
Light it !
The ransom for you two is fixed at 20,000 pieces of eight .
I shall provide a boat for you ... to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica to collect it .
Meanwhile , mademoiselle remains with me as hostage .
I find it very lonely on this island .
I refuse absolutely and utterly !
You know this ?
It is the rosary of pain .
It is possible to screw a man 's eyes out of his head .
Very well . Do your worst .
AIors !
No , stop !
Lord Willoughby , thank you , but don 't be foolish .
MademoiseIIe is right .
Thank you , miss .
I beg you to spare yourself and the young lady .
You know , I 've been too modest with you ... but since I have said 20,000 pieces of eight ... eh bien , I have said 20,000 pieces of eight .
For what , if you please , have you said 20,000 pieces of eight ?
If it ain 't the niece of our old friend Col. Bishop .
You don 't recognize her .
Mind that . What does he mean ?
Your guess is as good as mine .
- Good morning , Levasseur .
- hello , Captain .
- Cahusac .
- Capitaine .
I arrived late last night and put into a cove a few miles to the west .
We 've walked across to give you good morning , but , faith ... it seems we 've interrupted some business of yours .
- Who are these people ?
- Oh , yes , here .
As you see , two prisoners .
I captured an English ship .
Yes . We saw her coming across the spit .
I must congratulate you , Levasseur .
I didn 't so much as sight a sail .
The fortunes of war , my partner .
And these are also the fortunes of war ?
Big fortunes .
A nobleman and the niece of the Governor of Jamaica .
Really ?
I suppose congratulations are again in order ... but have you forgotten there 's an article in our agreement ... forbidding the taking of women prisoners ?
That 's a foolish article of yours .
I was not aware you regarded it so when we signed .
Would you care to dispute my opinion now , your men against mine ? Not this morning , thank you .
As you say , a foolish article .
Heard , my friend .
That is why these are prisoners of my own , a matter personal .
- And the 20,000 pieces of eight ?
- Their ransom .
- That is also a personal matter ?
- lt is .
Obviously , these two prisoners , and particularly the young lady ... must be kept in someone 's hands for , shall we say , safekeeping ... but why your hands ?
Why shouldn 't Pierre have her , or Roch , or Jacob ... since she 's as much their property as yours ?
Or doesn 't that please you ?
You 'd like to keep her for yourself .
And who might that be , do you suppose ?
- That is your Capt. Blood .
- Capt . Blood ?
Now , my captain ... since you covet our joint property of war , you may have her ... providing you 're willing to buy her .
- Buy her ?
- At the price you yourself have put on her .
20,000 pieces of eight .
The ransom is to be paid by Gov. Bishop .
It is for division when it comes .
But if the Governor should refuse to pay the ransom , what then ?
No .
If you 're to keep the girl meanwhile , pay the ransom .
Let it be your risk to collect it from the Governor .
Capt. Blood is right .
- lt 's in the articles .
- What 's in the articles , you fools ?
Where do you suppose I have 20,000 pieces of eight ?
- Let someone buy her who has .
- Who ? - l .
- You ?
Jeremy , Wolf , bring the prisoners forward .
Here they are , Peter .
I bid 20,000 pieces of eight .
Can you improve on that , Levasseur ?
I don 't wish to be bought by you .
As a lady once said to a slave ... you are hardly in a position to have anything to say about it .
- You want the girl ?
- Why not ?
And I 'm willing to pay for what I want .
Cahusac , you boast a knowledge of pearls .
At what do you value each of those ?
1,000 pieces each .
They 're worth rather more , but very well .
Here are 12 .
The three-fifths the value of the prize due your ship for having made the capture .
For the share due my men , I make myself responsible .
Now , Wolf , will you be so kind as to take my property aboard ship ?
And that settles that , my captain partner .
- No , you don 't !
- Stop , Capitaine !
Wait !
You 'll not take her while I live !
Then I 'll take her when you 're dead !
- Capitaine , it has been honorably settled .
- lt has not been settled for me !
What is a girl , more or less ?
Do not be a fool , Capitaine !
It 's my business .
Two breaches in our articles committed by you .
You should be marooned .
It 's what I intended for you in the end ... but since you prefer it this way , you muckrake , I 'll be humoring you .
Up !
And that , my friend , ends a partnership that should never have begun .
All these things I 've gathered in my journeys .
I 've gone far since I was a slave on your uncle 's plantation ... thousands of restless , hectic miles .
But somehow tonight , I 've got a strange feeling ... that my journey 's almost over .
You see these ankle rings ?
They came from a ship that was out from Persia .
And these pearls ... they 're the choice from a fleet we captured off the Azores .
- Have you ever seen such pearls ?
- Yes , I have .
They 're like the pearls you sometimes use for making purchases , are they not ?
- Yes , they are .
- How many lives did they cost ?
As few as possible .
It wasn 't lives I was after .
- What , then ?
- I never quite knew .
Some urge that drove me on .
Revenge , I suppose .
But I 've had my fill of revenge .
I often wondered why I bothered to save all these things .
Tonight I know it 's because ... one day you 'd be here in this cabin to wear them .
I 'll never wear them , never !
Those nor any other plunder gotten by a thief and pirate .
Thief and pirate .
I 've seen your pirate ways .
I 've seen myself bargained for and fought over .
A combat between jackals .
But I thought you understood .
You mean you thought you 'd bought me .
I suppose I should have regarded that as a compliment .
You pirates are used to taking without the formality of purchase .
I advise you to go back to your ladies at Tortuga ... who are thrilled by your bold , lawless ways .
I only hate you and despise you .
I might have expected your thanks for what I 've done this day ... but very well , let it be so .
I 'm a thief and pirate and I 'll show you how a thief and a pirate can deal .
Once , you bought me for a miserable £ 10 .
Now I 've bought you for considerably more .
The amount 's of no matter .
What matters is now I own you as you once owned me .
You 're mine , do you understand ?
Mine to do with as I please !
Capt. Blood , Lord Willoughby sends his compliments ... and requests you to talk with him at your convenience .
He 's been sent by the King himself .
Tell him I 'm not convenient to any friend of the King 's .
All I 've got to say is good riddance ... as soon as I can get him to his destination .
I shall .
Jeremy .
Wolverstone .
- Wolverstone !
- What is it , Peter ?
We 're changing course .
Draw down every rag of canvas the yards will hold .
- Aye , aye , Peter , but ... .
- Jeremy !
All hands on deck !
- Jeremy !
- Coming , Peter !
Forever sleeping when I need you ?
- I wasn 't sleeping .
I was- - - Never mind !
Get ready to go about .
- Set the course for Port Royal . - Port Royal ?
But the English fleet is at Port Royal .
Col. Bishop- -
Sweet , merciful heaven !
Haven 't you ears ?
Set the course for Port Royal !
- Make speed there , Wolverstone .
- Speed it is , Peter .
- Follow we a helm , west by north .
- West by north , sir .
Make speed there !
To your halyards !
Tacks and braces .
We head for Port Royal .
Make speed there !
That 's the order !
Make speed there .
There 's a gallows waiting for each of us at Port Royal ... and no man should be late to his own hanging .
How you hate the villain .
If I were a young man , I 'm dashed if I wouldn 't be jealous .
But you said you didn 't even know him .
He was once my slave .
Slave ?
Did you know him well ?
I did .
He 's not such a bad fellow for a pirate .
When he made his escape , I was thrilled and happy .
That was before I knew how he would use his freedom .
But aren 't you forgetting ... that a man 's bitter heart may demand revenge ?
That is the unforgivable thing :
to have put his revenge above everything else ... and to have destroyed himself .
That 's what he 's done .
I 've seen pirates . I know their ways .
Cruel , evil , greedy , plundering peaceful cities ... torturing their captives .
Beasts .
Are you so much in love with him ?
ln love with him ?
That you care so much what he does ?
I don 't care in the least what he does .
Someone should , in view of what he 's doing now .
But your uncle 's with the fleet at Port Royal .
That much is fortunate .
Why ?
What 's this about my uncle in Port Royal ?
He amazes me , this fellow .
That 's where he means to take us .
- No , he can 't .
- They won 't let me near him .
He 's alone on his quarterdeck in a fine Irish temper , I suspect .
- But I learned of it from one of the crew .
- Lord Willoughby , he mustn 't .
My uncle is a hard , unforgiving man .
He lives in the hope of one day taking and hanging Capt. Blood .
Capt. Blood probably doesn 't know that , of course .
I doubt if it 'd make any difference if he did .
He 's chivalrous to the point of idiocy .
Chivalrous ?
And yet he 's been what he 's been these last three years ... and done what he 's done .
Lord Willoughby , help me .
I see your point , my child ... but that 's something you must decide for yourself .
Life can be infernally complex .
It 's hard to lay tongue to the right words .
I 'll lay tongue to them .
We won 't sail to Jamaica .
Them 's the words .
Aye , Bishop 's entire fleet 's at Jamaica .
When you risked your neck in a duel over that petticoat ... that was your business .
But it 's our necks you 're risking now , and I say no .
Not for her , nor a dozen like her .
I got a great affection for my neck .
I have no wish to hear it cracked by a hangman 's knot .
This is what comes from sailing the seas with a lovesick madman .
We 've been with you since the first , Peter .
We have a right .
You , too , Jeremy ?
All right , lads .
What do you mean , Peter ?
You told me we 're not sailing to Jamaica .
There 's nothing more to be said .
- Hurrah for our side !
- Quiet . You sound like a rooster .
Good night , lads .
Wait a minute , Peter .
Where are we sailing for ?
That 's for you to tell me ... since I 'm no longer running this ship .
We didn 't say that , Peter .
As Jeremy says , you 've got the right .
You 've been with me from the first , and you 've been loyal and true ... followed me into every tight corner men could follow another .
- But you always got us out .
- And none the poorer for it .
Yes , but on this occasion , there 's no gold to be got .
Do you think it was for gold we followed you ?
No , but I can see now I 've not got the right to ask you to follow me .
The girl is my concern , not yours .
Are we gonna stand by and see this little snip laugh at our captain ?
There 's Bishop 's fleet .
That might be paying a high price to keep from being laughed at .
We 're not yet such lily-livered scum as to be afraid of Col. Bishop .
No .
That is , not very afraid .
Fie on you deserting our captain in this way ... you scurvy traitors , you Judas Iscariots , you snakes in the grass ... you wolves in sheep 's clothing !
I was only with them to spy on them . You 'd better think carefully , lads .
Yonder lies Jamaica , and straight we sail for it .
- Aye .
And straight we sail for it .
- Aye !
- Ahoy , the deck !
- Ahoy !
I have sighted Port Royal !
Aye ! Port Royal , you say ?
Aye , sir !
There 's something amiss !
I see flashes of gunfire from ships in the harbor !
- Fetch the Captain .
- Aye , sir .
Bugler , all hands on deck !
It 's terrible to wake up at dawn dreaming of thunder .
That 's gunfire if I ever heard any .
- There 's a battle in Port Royal harbor .
- How many ships do you make out ?
It 's hard to see clearly in the early morning light .
I think there are two .
It 's an attack on Port Royal , but who ?
Pirate craft , perhaps .
Wish I could make out their flags .
- Perhaps I can supply you the answer .
- You can ?
Yes , if I may speak to so inaccessible a person .
If Port Royal is being attacked , they are likely French ships .
French ?
You say Port royal 's attacked by the French ?
Why ? When two countries are at war and one is attacked ... who would it be but the enemy ?
What 's this ?
France and England at war ?
You mean you don 't know ?
Where have you been the past few months ?
At sea , out of touch with the world .
The fire from the fortress is weakening !
One ship is already firing on the town !
That 's strange .
Where is the English fleet that 's supposed to protect the town ?
It 's my turn to supply the answer .
It 's out chasing pirates .
Bishop would never let his fleet leave its post in time of war . He wouldn 't dare .
Col. Bishop , if I may say , is a very old and dear friend of mine .
- lt 's probably me he 's after .
- That fool !
Blunder !
And me in his own front yard . Shorten sail there , Wolf .
Lend a hand forward , Andy .
Stand by helm and keep her headed two points to larboard of the fort .
Aye , aye , sir .
Get your men to their stations , Chester .
Port watch to stations !
Speed there , lads !
- Reef the fore topsail !
- Aye , aye , sir !
Take in the topgallant sail .
May I ask , Captain , what are your intentions ?
Lord Willoughby , I set out to land you at Port Royal , but now ... .
Miss Bishop , an unlooked-for circumstance ... prevents my landing you on your own dock .
But I trust that if I put you ashore on the beach nearby ... that would be equally satisfactory ?
- l--
- Thank you .
Only please understand , this is a bargain ... your freedom for my freedom .
From now on , I no longer regard myself as a slave .
My life 's my own ... even though I 'm a thief and pirate .
Capt. Blood , are you , an Englishman , thinking of leaving ... when yonder , an English town is being taken ?
Hagthorpe , clear my deck and keep it cleared .
- Aye , Peter , we 'll take care of him .
- Take your hands off !
- Wait , lads .
- Capt . Blood , I must talk to you .
Very well then , Lord Willoughby .
Myself , I 've the honor to be Irish , but part of my crew 's English .
I was myself once , too , in loyalty .
Of what should we be thinking ?
Of the chance to fight for your king .
To fight for my king ?
Yes .
You hear that , Chester ?
The King wants us to join his navy !
Read it for yourself .
Lord Willoughby , you 're a guest aboard my ship ... and I 've still some notion left me from better days of decent behavior ... so I 'll not be telling you what I think of this offer .
All I 'll say is , I wouldn 't soil my hands with it ... even though they 're the hands of a thief and a pirate .
But this concerns you , too , my lads .
What do you say to serving the King ?
No !
I 'd like to serve him with a rope necktie .
I 'd rot before I 'd serve him .
I 'd sink this ship with all hands before I 'd serve him .
It would appear then that my crew is still a little dubious ... as to the merits of His Majesty 's offer .
However you hate the King , England is still England .
And a bad king is bad king , and worse one if he 's James .
James ?
This commission is sent by King William .
King William ?
Who may King William be and what 's he king of ?
I 'm alluding to His Majesty , King William III , William of Orange ... who , with Queen Mary , has come over from the Netherlands ... and has been ruling England the past two months or more .
They 've roused themselves at home and kicked out that pimple James ?
Yes , and he 's fled to France and he 's in hiding there ... and England and France are at war .
The English people will go so far , Capt. Blood ... and then they get up on their stubborn hind legs .
- And William sent us this commission ? - Yes .
He knows you 're good men , wrongfully sold into slavery .
He can use good men in his navy .
It 's the long-winded fellow you are .
Why didn 't you tell us this in the first place ?
Bugler , summon the men amidships !
Men !
I 've just heard a startling piece of news .
King James is kicked out of England and good King William reigns in his stead .
For me , this changes the shape of the world .
For you who were slaves with me ... it means that we 're no longer slaves .
That we once more have a home and a country .
For you who are English ... it means a chance to fight for your native land ... for I now propose to sail into Port Royal and take it from the French !
Those of you who are not English ... will have to be content with fighting for Capt. Blood ... and the loot you 'll find on the French ships .
- Are you willing to fight , men ? - Aye !
Have we an English battle flag on board , Hagthorpe ?
We have every manner of battle flag , including a lady 's purple petticoat .
Wait , I 've a better idea .
When an English lion creeps up on a nest of French foxes ... he wears a bushy tail .
Hoist the French flag , Hagthorpe .
Keep her trimmed by the head , Wolf .
Stand by the helm , Jeremy .
Forward , men , to your stations .
- ls that satisfactory to you ?
- Perfectly .
Clear decks for action !
Capt. Blood 's orders .
You 'll be put ashore with these men .
A ship is no place for a woman in time of battle .
- I want to talk to him .
- I 'm sorry . The Captain 's busy .
- lnto the boat .
- Aye , sir .
Follow me , Miss Bishop .
Musketeers , to your stations !
A French ship .
Hope we get on them before they discover the trick .
- Andy .
- Aye , Peter .
Run to Hagthorpe .
Tell him to fetch all the hot coals .
- Put them by the guns .
- Hot coals , sir ?
- No questions .
Run .
- Aye , aye , sir !
Stand by ready to fire as soon as we come amidships .
Stand ready to fire as soon as we 've come amidships !
Open your ports !
Strike that French flag and hoist our own colors .
Man your port guns !
Ready , Hagthorpe ?
Fire !
Hagthorpe , give them the hot galley broadside !
Aye , Peter !
Load them , lads !
Hagthorpe , keep pounding that water line !
We never miss .
- That 's one ship neatly disposed off .
- Now for the other one .
- Jeremy , helm quarter to port .
- Aye , aye , Peter .
Clear away that burning wreckage !
- Port guns , Wolf . Hurry .
- Aye , Peter .
Man your port guns !
Those French gunners must 've learnt their trade in England .
That 's their third direct hit .
Two guns out of order .
Ship 's taking water below .
Replace them with two from the starboard side .
- Keep hammering that waterline . - Aye , aye , sir .
Lower gun deck 's awash , we 're sinking .
What should we do ? Do ?
We 'll board a ship that 's not sinking .
Get your men forward .
Aye , aye , sir .
- What now , Peter ?
- Take the helm yourself , lad .
Straight into them !
- We 'll never do it , Peter !
- Musketeers to the prow !
Grappling hooks to larboard .
Forward gunners , fire as hard as they can load !
Rapid fire , men !
Hagthorpe , double them up !
They won 't take it , Peter !
They 're blazing hot !
Up into the shrouds , men !
We 're going to swing across on ropes .
When we clear the rail , come over the side !
Aye , aye , Peter !
You and your men swing across into their rigging .
When you see me cut down that French flag , drop down . Up , men , into the shrouds !
Strong and sure !
Grapnels over !
All right , my hearties , follow me !
Follow on , men !
" Dust thou art , and unto dust thou shalt return . "
" Love thy neighbor as thyself . "
Leviticus 19 : 18 .
- Hurry , Cato . We 'll be late .
- Yes .
The fleet 's in already .
- Stop !
- Yes .
Capt. Blood !
Miss Bishop .
I 'll be on the veranda .
I thought you 'd gone .
You can 't be here .
My uncle 's just returned .
- Yes , I know .
- You know ?
- What are you going to do ?
- Just stay here .
No , it 's impossible .
You mustn 't stay here .
- He 's sworn he 'll hang you .
- I doubt he will .
I 've always been bad luck for your uncle .
You can 't know the threats he 's made .
The dreadful threats he 's made .
His whole life is spent in searching for you .
- Now he 's found me .
- But you can still save yourself .
Please , for my sake .
For your sake ?
What do you mean for your sake ?
Isn 't it true that you hate me ? - Hate you ?
- Or is it that you love me ?
I 'll hide you .
And tonight after dark , I 'll find some way- -
You love me , don 't you ?
Whom else would I love ?
Now will you ?
You love me !
Lord Willoughby , she loves me !
He 'll be here any minute .
I 'll hide you somewhere .
We 'll hide together . I know just the place .
How 's this ?
You must be mad .
He 'll come here first .
Good .
I forgot to tell you .
The Governor and I are on the best of terms .
He lets me come and go here as I please . Look .
- You can 't arrest me !
- I have , by order of the Governor .
The Governor ?
You are mad .
I am the governor .
You mean , you were the governor .
But we 've changed that in your absence .
What ?
You 're broken for abandoning your post in time of war .
Who are you ?
My name is Willoughby .
I 'm a special emissary of His Majesty the King .
Lord Willoughby ?
- You were informed , I think , of my coming .
- Yes .
Yet you went off on some wild goose chase after a pirate ... leaving your capital at the mercy of the enemy .
Col. Bishop , this is a serious matter , as you may well find .
Seeing that you hold your office from James ... it 's even possible the charge of treason lies against you .
But , my lord- -
I 'm not concerned to hear your reasons , man .
- His Excellency the Governor will .
- The Governor ?
You 'll find him inside .
It rests entirely with him whether you 're hanged or not .
This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood .
What a reckoning there 'll be when we meet .
Have mercy , Your Excellency !
- Arabella , why are you here ? - Uncle !
I have been pleading with the Governor on your behalf ... asking him to be as merciful as you would be cruel .
Uncle , this is the Governor .
Good morning , Uncle .
- No , I won 't .
Let 's get out of here .
- There 's nothing to be afraid of .
When I go out to a play , I want to have some fun .
You bring me to a place like this where they make you scream and faint .
But it 's a fillip to jaded nerves .
It 's a new shudder .
Well , if that 's the kind of a man you are , you can take me home .
Now , wait a minute , darling .
You 've got it all wrong .
Flowers again .
- A gentleman of the old school , Marie .
- Old or new , they all try the same things .
" Tonight I 'm sad .
For no longer will I be able to watch you every evening
" from my lonely , shadowed box . " And no signature .
A man can 't take the same box every night for 47 nights without the whole theatre knowing who he is .
Gogol .
Nasty , foreign-sounding name .
That was very mean of you .
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Making fun of a famous man like Dr. Gogol .
Well , if he 's so famous , what 's he doing hanging around here all the time ?
Why , Marie , my public .
No , he really is a great surgeon .
He cures deformed children and mutilated soldiers .
Soldiers ?
I wish he 'd fix one up for me .
Your usual box , Professor ?
- Will you do me a favor ?
- Of course .
Call Dr. Wong at my clinic and tell him I 'll be there before midnight , will you ?
Most happy , Doctor .
Beautiful .
Beautiful .
I 've been meeting you in dreams all my life , standing just like that .
You know me .
Raoul , your own little cabbage ?
Take your hands off .
Why didn 't you warn me , my dear ?
My card , monsieur .
I 'm perfectly willing to give you satisfaction .
Don 't be a fool .
And don 't you be jealous , my friend .
She 's not for either of us .
She 's only wax .
Good evening , Doctor .
What time is it ?
Just on the hour .
What number is the station ?
Madame , I only told you four times tonight , 12.50 .
After I was married a year , I remembered things like radio stations and forgot my husband .
Continuing our concert from Fontainebleau , we shall now hear one of the most brilliant younger English pianists , an artist with a great future .
How about mentioning that he 's married to an artist with a great future ?
Louder , Marie , he didn 't hear you .
- Curtain call , madame .
- Oh , yes , yes ... here , tonight , for the first time on any concert stage , an original composition ofMonsieur Orlac .
Hurry , please , please , hurry .
His enviable reputation for purity of tone and brilliance of technique .
Monsieur Orlac is now on the platform .
- Curtain call , Yvonne .
- Oh , yes , Charles .
You listen , Marie .
You know the signal .
If he coughs twice , it means " I love you . "
Sir , how dare you threaten your Duchess with torture ?
- The Duke .
- You see my warrant .
You only have one question to answer .
Who was the man who escaped from your balcony in the palace ?
No !
Don 't !
How you must love him .
Nicolo , you 're my husband .
You loved me once .
His name ?
Yes , he was there .
Yes , I do love him .
But do you think I 'd betray him to your vengeance ?
Never !
- How very unpleasant .
Bring the irons . - No !
Yes , yes , it was your brother !
- Did he cough ?
- Certainly .
- How many times ?
- Six , eight , ten times . I lost count .
Maybe he has a cold .
If he doesn 't cough , he doesn 't love you .
If he coughs too much , he has a cold .
What a system .
From now on , we won 't need any more systems .
Maybe we 'll miss all this .
Curtain calls , grease paint , an audience .
Stephen will be my audience .
It 's a waste , one person .
No , no , not waste , Marie .
Happiness . Marie , come on , we need help at the party .
You go , I can dress myself .
And don 't get too near the punch bowl .
Monsieur Orlac 's last number will be the G Minor Ballade by Chopin .
And I love you , darling .
Madame Yvonne , would it be possible ?
Come in .
Oh , it 's you , Dr. Gogol .
- You know me ?
- We all know you .
You 've kept the theatre running by buying that box every night .
Won 't you come in ?
Thank you so much for all the lovely flowers .
Every night I have watched you and tonight , the last night , I felt I must come and thank you
- for what you have meant to me .
- I 'm very flattered , Doctor .
And when the theatre reopens , I shall be in my box again .
- Every night .
- I do hope so , for the theatre 's sake .
- I won 't be here , I 'm afraid .
- You are playing somewhere else ?
Never again .
- Never again ?
I 'm going to England with my husband .
Your ... Your husband ?
Yes , that 's he playing now from Fontainebleau .
Stephen Orlac .
I 'm meeting his train tonight .
- Stephen Orlac .
- How do you think he plays ?
That 's his own composition , you know .
Very modern music .
We 've been married a year , but he 's been on tour and I 've been busy with the theatre .
So you see , this is really going to be our honeymoon .
You know , I 've come to depend on seeing you every night .
But I 'm going to England .
But I must see you again .
I must .
Yvonne , we 're all waiting . Hurry .
Dr. Gogol , why not join our party ?
You represent our public . Come on .
Oh ! Lovely !
A wedding cake for the bride who 's been married a year .
Who hasn 't been on her honeymoon yet .
What am I bid for the first slice ?
- A kiss for the bride . - Sold .
I want to kiss the bride , too .
The line forms on the right .
One kiss , one piece of cake for each .
- I 'm next .
- Me , too .
What ... Doctor .
- No champagne , no cake , and no kiss ?
- No , thank you .
Come along .
Yvonne .
Yvonne .
Yvonne .
Yvonne , don 't forget our public .
- Dr. Gogol .
- Dr. Gogol .
That 's a good one .
- I wish I had one like that . - You would , eh ?
- Who 's next ?
- I 'm next .
- No , I ...
- No , I am next .
How about me ? How about me ?
Where are you taking that figure ?
- To the melting pot .
- Melting pot ?
Yes , 50 francs of wax in that thing .
And no doubt you 'd take 75 for it . Would you ?
What 's the idea ?
- Did you ever hear of Galatea ?
- Galla who ?
- Not wanting a statue of him , are you ?
- I don 't want a statue of Galatea .
You see , she was a statue herself .
Pygmalion formed her , out of marble , not wax .
And then ,
she came to life in his arms .
Start the motor , Henry .
There 's queer people on the streets of Montmartre at this time of night .
Here , 100 francs , if you 'll deliver the statue to my house .
It 's a go , Dr. Gogol .
First thing in the morning .
You see , monsieur , 20 francs extra for the dog in the van .
Of course , monsieur , the guard .
You will keep my confidence ?
Well , if my silence is worth 20 francs to you , buy it .
I 'm hungry .
- Who is that man ?
- Rollo , the murderer .
Rollo .
You read the case , monsieur ?
The American threw knives in a circus .
Stuck one in his father 's back because of a woman .
He was convicted last week .
His autograph .
I have here autographs of a hundred famous persons and not a single murderer .
May I use your pen , monsieur ? Thank you .
- Pardon me .
- Come on in , fat boy .
- Monsieur Rollo ?
- Yeah . - Don 't you stick your nose in here .
- Yes . You might get it pinched .
Give a guy a break .
You boys won 't gab with me .
- I followed your case in the papers .
- Yeah ? For once I got top billing .
Boy , I bet it burned those guys in the circus .
How did you happen to become such a great expert at knife-throwing ?
Practice . Learned to toss a penknife when I was six .
Run away with the circus at 10, and made my living with a knife .
- May I have your autograph ? - Sure .
Give me .
Say , you can 't talk about her like that .
I loved that dame , even if she did two-time me .
The pen .
Well , old hands can still do their stuff , eh ?
What do you want here ?
- Well , this happens to be my pen .
- Well , take it and get out .
- What about that call for Dr. Gogol ?
- They 're still trying to get him .
Here 's the American journalist you sent for .
Hiya , kid .
- Hello , Chief .
- Monsieur Reagan .
You are the gentleman who 's going to cover this execution ?
Yeah . I wish they 'd cover it so I can 't see it .
You know , I got a weak stomach .
This Rollo is an American .
Yes . That 's why it will make a good story for our paper .
The fact is , we are anxious to avoid undue sensationalism
- in the American papers .
- I know what you mean .
- I 'll use a soft pencil .
- Thank you .
And if , as you say , your nerves are a little weak ,
- I suggest you bring a flask of cognac .
- No . Gin , Chief .
Gin for executions , beer for birthdays , wine for weddings and champagne .
- Oh , champagne .
- For what ?
You ask that and you 're a Frenchman ?
Dr. Gogol 's clinic on the wire .
Her first natural sleep in weeks .
Poor little thing .
Tomorrow you can take the boards out from under her .
- Telephone for you , Professor .
- Don 't disturb me now .
- The brace will give sufficient support .
- Yes , Professor .
But , it 's the Prefect of Police himself . He insists .
Yes , Monsieur Rosset ?
Yes .
Rollo ?
Tomorrow at 6 : 00 ?
Of course , I 'll be there . Thank you .
Is that Dr. Gogol , the famous surgeon ?
- You 're very inquisitive .
- Well , that 's my job to be inquisitive .
I wonder if I could get him to write some articles for our newspaper .
You 'll see him at the guillotine .
Why not ask him ? Good idea .
Rollo 's train gets in from Fontainebleau in 20 minutes .
Like to come to the station with me ?
Why , certainly .
A welcome committee and a farewell party rolled into one .
Hey , Chief , let 's get out of here .
This thing 's a Turkish bath .
Can you please tell me when the Fontainebleau Express will arrive ?
Go ahead and tell her , Chief .
No one seems to know , madame .
It 's 20 minutes late already .
Hey , Chief , look .
What 's the matter ?
Has this whole town gone crazy ?
Wrecked ! Number 18 is wrecked !
What train is wrecked ?
Sorry , madame , I can 't give any information .
Then give it to me .
Fontainebleau Express , Monsieur le Prefect .
- Is it serious ?
- I don 't know , madame .
- Where was it ?
- Near Geron , 20 miles out .
Relief train leaving on Track 9 .
- Please . - Can I see you a minute ?
Please . Please , may I go with the relief train ?
- Sorry , madam , it 's against orders .
- Come on , we 'll get a taxi .
All right , fellows . Come on , everybody .
Stephen !
Help me , please . Please help me .
Help me somebody ! Please , here .
- Well , Doctor ?
- Your husband will live .
Madame , what joy .
The head injury is not serious .
It 's only his hands .
- Only his hands ?
- I 'm afraid we shall have to amputate .
Amputate ! No , no !
No , Doctor , you don 't understand !
His hands ... He 's a great pianist !
But even so , madame , what are hands when it 's a matter of saving life ?
- But his hands are his life !
- Excuse me .
- Madame , Dr. Gogol .
- Oh , no , not that man .
But he 's a genius , madame , and if it means Monsieur Stephen 's life ?
Yes . Yes .
Doctor ... Doctor , can you get an ambulance to take my husband to Paris
- to Dr. Gogol 's house immediately ?
- But , madame ... I know the risk .
I 'll take the responsibility .
Dr. Marbeau , there are two operations waiting .
As you wish , madame .
It 's great to start the day off .
Oh , all right . All right . I 'm coming .
I 'm coming . Ring your head off .
All right . There .
Hello ?
Hello ?
Yes , this is the Professor Gogol 's housekeeper .
Yes .
Well , the Professor isn 't here .
If you want to know , he 's visiting Madame Guillotine .
He never misses one of those head choppings .
Attention !
Present arms !
Attention !
Say , Chief , I barely made this .
You know , they had me in the jug .
They said I insulted one of those gendarmes at the wreck .
- Quiet , Monsieur Reagan , if you please . - Okay .
Boy .
Ain 't that something .
He 's an American , ain 't he ?
Can I ask him a question ?
- Hiya , buddy .
- Hiya , partner .
- Tough luck , kid .
- We all get it in the neck some day .
- Say , tell me something , will you ?
- Anything you want to know .
Well , I 'm from Las Vegas and I hear they finished the big dam .
Biggest in the world , and it 's making a lake 200 miles long .
It 's the gospel truth , kid .
Well , what do you think of that ?
So long .
Come on .
Not ill , my friend , are you ?
Oh , Doc , on the level I 'm as sick as a bedbug .
Come here a minute .
Say , how 'd you like to make a couple of bucks by writing some articles for the magazine section of our paper
- back in New York ?
- Why buy articles about me ?
You can get all you want from the medical journals .
Wait a minute .
Who reads the medical journals ?
The stuff I want is the stuff you do you don 't put in the journals .
Are you catching on ?
And I 'm not interested in your publicity , young man .
Well , Doc , you want to make a couple of dollars , don 't you ?
Chief , will you talk ... Ain 't that murder .
Suzanne .
- Yes , Professor ?
- Why that ambulance ?
I ordered no case here for experiment .
They brought a man whose hands were smashed in the Fontainebleau wreck .
What man ?
What wreck ?
How dare you let people turn my clinic into a public hospital ?
But , Professor , his wife brought him , a Madam Orlac .
- What ?
- She said you were her friend .
- Where is he ?
- In the ward with Dr. Wong .
- Has he come yet ?
- Yes .
He 's with your husband .
Oh , thank heaven .
Prepare for amputation .
Doctor .
His hands ? Can you save them ?
Calm yourself , madame .
He 's in no danger .
There are other outlets for musical talent besides playing .
He 's also a composer .
I understand .
You mean to amputate .
And I believed you could save them .
Believed you would help me .
If it would help , I 'd gladly give my own two hands , but ...
All right , then .
Now you must rest and when you awaken , everything will be over .
If I could only help her .
If I could only find a way .
- There must be a ...
- Impossible , Professor .
- Impossible ?
- Impossible .
Napoleon said that word is not French !
Suzanne !
Suzanne !
Call the Prefecture of Police .
Get Prefect Rosset himself .
Emergency call !
Stop the anesthetic .
Stop the anesthetic .
Of course I want to help you , Dr. Gogol , but I 've got to get a release .
Don 't worry about it .
I 'll have Rollo 's body at your clinic within 30 minutes .
Good luck with your experiment .
Increase the carbon dioxide .
Congratulations , Professor . You 've done it .
Once I felt the blood pulsing through the hands , I knew the operation would succeed .
- Thank you .
- Good night , Professor .
Good night .
Whatever made him bring you here ?
There 's never been any woman in this house but me .
And if he must have them here , I prefer live ones to dead ones .
Francoise .
Yes , Monsieur Professor .
Pretty , isn 't she ?
- Get out .
- Yes , monsieur .
- Hello , there . How are you ?
- Well , who are you ?
That 's no way to talk to a gentleman .
Ain 't that a pretty bird ?
You know , I got a parrot of my own .
- Well , what do you want ?
- I got to see Dr. Gogol .
- It 's a very important matter .
- Nobody comes in here .
Come here . Come here , queenie .
Lookie here . Now , there 's a 50-franc note .
I 'll give it to you if you 'll answer me one question .
Now , they brought a stiff in here .
What did he do with it ?
Oh , I don 't know .
He 's upstairs fussing over it now .
There 's your answer . Now get out .
What are they doing with the head ?
Playing football with it ?
The head ?
Yes , the head 's off .
I saw it come off myself .
Well , the head was on when they carried it in here .
- Are you sure of that ?
- I 'm sure of it .
Holy jumping catfish !
What 's going on in here ?
Now , now , you can 't come in here !
Do you want me to lose my job ?
Come here a second , will you , please ?
Galatea .
But I am no Pygmalion .
" The face of all the world is changed , I think ,
" Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul "
" Guess now who holds thee ?
" ' Death , ' I said
" But , there , the silver answer rang
" ' Not death , but love " '
You know , it was wonderful having you to myself all these months .
You 're a selfish little thing , aren 't you ?
Look .
Spring in Paris .
I feel so helpless .
Never mind .
You won 't have them much longer .
- They ... They feel dead .
- They will for a time .
You see , the muscles are atrophied at present from lack of use .
But they ... They don 't look like mine .
You forget they were badly crushed . Alcohol .
No one in the world but you , Doctor , could have performed this miracle .
We can never repay you .
I had to find a way because you trusted me .
- We can 't possibly express our gratitude .
- Don 't . Please .
Now , try to move your fingers .
There . Splendid .
Well , I began playing the piano with one finger .
I can start that way again .
Of course , there 's still much to be done .
You 'll need some regular massage , some ultra-violet treatments , graduated exercise .
I 'm afraid it will prove a long and expensive business .
You 're an angel .
You know we 'll pay you just as soon as Monsieur Stephen is well again .
I understand , madame .
I used to play rather well once , didn 't I ?
- And you will again , dear .
- No , not with these .
Wonderful invention , the phonograph .
Keeps a man alive long after he 's dead .
Please , don 't say things like that , darling .
Sometimes I feel that these records
- are all that 's left of Stephen Orlac .
- All of Stephen Orlac is left .
His tenderness , his genius , and his arms .
The arms that hold me close to him .
Forgive me , darling , for thinking so much of myself .
More practice , that 's the answer .
Yes , that 's it . More practice .
Well , but if it weren 't for these money troubles ...
I know what you 're doing .
Selling everything .
Even your rings .
Yvonne , I 'm so sorry .
- We 'll be all right .
- Yes , of course , we will .
- Stephen . - Yeah ?
I know how proud you are , but why don 't you go to your stepfather ?
No . No .
I swore I 'd never see that man again .
But , darling , this is an emergency , surely .
It wouldn 't mean a thing to him .
Have we heard one word from him since my accident ?
No . I tell you , darling , it isn 't a question of pride ...
Then don 't go .
We 'll manage somehow .
You have no right to force your way in here .
The piano is still our property till the loan is paid .
Sorry , madame , he pushed his way past me .
I want my money .
But , monsieur , we really intend to pay you .
I want my money or I 'll take the piano .
But you can 't take it .
It means everything to my husband .
So , you can 't pay , eh ?
Very well , I 'll return tomorrow with a court order .
This happens to be my pen , gentlemen .
Monsieur Stephen .
Hello , Pierre .
Is my father in ?
Hello , Father .
Well , the great musician , eh ?
- What do you want ?
- Can 't you forget ?
- Can 't we be friends ?
- And how is the piano-playing ?
Well , since my accident , I haven 't been able to play .
- Can we go into the office ?
- So that 's it .
- You 've come here for money .
- I never said so .
But I thought you might have a little understanding , sympathy ...
- Sympathy ?
- All right , Father . All right .
- I don 't want your money .
- That 's good .
Because you won 't get a franc , not a sou .
For years I 've wanted you in business with me .
But being a tradesman wasn 't good enough for you .
Now that your hands are smashed up , you can 't thump a piano any longer , you come crawling back to me .
And that actress you married .
Why don 't you let her help you now ?
Her pay may be small , but she could supplement her earnings .
Stop it !
No !
Monsieur ! Monsieur !
To be near you like this , is more happiness than I 've ever known .
But , Dr. Gogol , quite frankly , I asked you to come here to talk about Stephen .
And you must tell me the truth .
Will he ever be able to play again ?
I mean , as he used to play ?
Her thoughts are only for him .
He 's my husband and I love him .
Is there no room in your heart , even pity for a man who has never known the love of a woman , but who has worshipped you since the day he first walked by that absurd little theatre ?
Dr. Gogol , please .
Well , I can 't be silent any longer .
- You 're a woman . You must have known ...
- Yes .
Yes , I knew of your feeling for me .
I traded on it .
And since you saved Stephen , I feel deeper friendship for you than for anyone , but ...
I can give you nothing else in return .
- Nothing ?
- Nothing .
Even if I didn 't love him , there 's something about you that ...
- Repulses you ?
- Frightens me .
You are cruel , but only to be kind .
Thank you for trying to understand .
And now see what he 's gone and bought you , dearie .
It cost him a whole month of my wages .
But what 's that to you .
I hired out as a housekeeper , and what am I now ?
Lady 's maid to a waxwork .
Now ...
And flycatcher for a plant .
Wait a minute now . Just wait a ...
Now , here 's your dinner .
You 'll be dead soon , dearie .
He likes dead things .
Now who can that be ?
Now , you stay here , Josephine , go on , till I go and see who it is .
I 'll see who that is ringing the bell .
All right , all right . Coming . I 'm coming .
It 's a woman 's place to carry her all the way down .
If I could only get to that bell , I 'd be all right .
That 's fine . That 's it .
Now I can see all right .
So , it 's you again .
Now , how many times am I to send you away ?
I 've got to see the doctor or I 'll get fired . Listen , queenie ...
- Well , you can 't see the doctor .
- I got a present for you .
- Napoleon Brandy .
- Cognac ?
- I like cognac .
- Well , I like you .
You do like that cognac .
I like cognac .
You know , I used to go with a girl like you .
Only , she drank .
Now , tell me , what did he do with it ?
You said it had no head .
Well , I looked at the head and there ain 't no marks on the neck .
When did you look at the head ?
I look at it every day .
He makes me brush its hair every evening .
Brush his hair ?
Where does he keep it ?
Upstairs in his drawing room , just like it was alive .
He sits at his organ and he plays music to it every night .
- He plays music to it every night ?
- Every night .
- And you brush his hair ?
- Every ...
I got to see this .
Sorry , I gotta see the whole thing ...
Wait a minute .
You can 't go up there .
My job ...
I 'd get into an awful row with the Professor .
You know , I can 't do this .
What are you doing ?
- Madam Orlac .
- Yeah , but you can 't go in there .
- What is she doing in there ?
- The Professor ...
- Francoise !
- Monsieur Professor .
Hiya , Doc .
I 'm sorry to butt in like this , but we newspaper fellas have to barge in places we 're not really welcome .
I didn 't know there was anything going on between you and Madam Orlac .
- Get out of here .
- I 'll go .
I got a business proposition . I got a proposition to offer you .
$ 2,000 to write some articles for our paper .
You know , of your experiments .
I want to ...
- Get out of here ! - I 'll go .
Will I be able to walk after ?
Yes , my child .
Then , I 'm not afraid .
I have saved 50 francs .
- All I have in the world .
- I do not operate for money .
Thank you , Doctor .
I must see him . I must .
What have you done to me ?
- Monsieur Orlac .
- What have you done to me ?
- Come in here .
- You and your black magic .
- What 's wrong ?
- You know very well .
Now , what is it ?
I 've just come back from Geron .
I 've seen Dr. Marbeau .
He told me that my hands were crushed beyond saving and that these aren 't mine .
Marbeau ?
Who is this Marbeau ?
- Well , whose hands are these ?
- What 's wrong with them ?
Ten fingers , every nerve , every muscle works perfectly .
What 's wrong with them ?
They have a life of their own .
They feel for knives .
They want to throw them .
And they know how to .
Watch .
And that 's not the worst .
They want to kill .
And today they tried to kill my father .
- With a knife ?
- Yes .
Now , my friend , I understand your case .
And I think I can help you .
Well , go on .
Ready for operation , Professor .
First , forget that provincial fool .
I am Gogol , and I tell you those are your hands .
- Yes , but why ...
- Don 't interrupt .
After the shock of the wreck came a second shock .
Your hands were altered by my knife .
You could no longer play .
As a result , your disturbed mind was ready for any phobia .
But the knives ?
The wish to kill ?
Your case is one of arrested wish fulfillment .
But why should I wish to throw knives ?
Perhaps , as a little child , some playmate threw a knife cleverly .
You wished you could do it like him .
Now , that wish was not fulfilled .
It festered deep in your subconscious .
If you could bring that forgotten memory , whatever it is , into consciousness , you would be cured instantly .
Knife .
Knives .
No , I remember nothing .
Marie , has he come home yet ?
- I 've looked everywhere for him .
- No , madame .
But Dr. Gogol called .
He wants you to come to him at once .
- Dr. Gogol ? When ?
- Half an hour ago , madame .
Half an hour ago ?
You told him the truth ?
I told him a lot of nonsense I don 't believe myself .
I didn 't dare to tell him his hands are those of a murderer .
That would probably drive him ... to commit murder himself .
Madame Orlac to see you , Professor .
Have her come in .
- But the operation , Professor .
- Leave me .
What 's happened ?
Where is he ?
I sent him home .
- I think if he follows my advice ...
- What advice ?
To go away , burrow himself in the country .
It 's absolutely necessary for his cure that he go alone .
But , do you mean that I 'm not to go with him ?
Yes .
Why did you give him that advice ?
I did what I could for him .
I 've failed .
The shock has affected his mind .
His life is ruined already .
Yvonne , get away from him before he ruins your life as well .
Now I understand .
You don 't .
How could you ?
I , a poor peasant , have conquered science .
Why can 't I conquer love ?
Don 't you understand ?
You must be mine .
Not his .
You are mine .
Liar . Hypocrite .
You disgust me .
Start the anesthetic .
Liar !
Hypocrite !
You disgust me !
They are laughing at you in there .
Go back .
They are laughing .
Let them laugh !
Nothing matters to you but one thing .
Yvonne .
Yvonne in your arms .
You can conquer love .
Of course you can .
Think .
You 've thought for others , now think for yourself .
Power of suggestion .
See how easy it is ?
Already working .
Splendid .
Splendid .
He 's a weakling , anyway .
Do it .
And then she 'll be helpless .
She must come to you .
Doctor , thank you !
My little girl will walk again .
You saved her . You saved her .
I 'm so happy .
Thank you , Doctor .
Thank you .
Extra !
Read all about it !
Rich jeweler murdered !
Extra !
Read all about it !
Rich jeweler murdered !
Rich jeweler murdered ! Extra !
Yes , Monsieur Stephen , he grabbed the knife from the counter .
He threw it at his father . And then , he ran out .
- Is this the knife ?
- Yes .
Take it to Varsac to check for fingerprints .
Tell me , why should Stephen Orlac want to kill his father ?
They were arguing about money , monsieur .
There were hot words .
Was it you who telephoned me to come here ?
Yes .
You said you 'd tell me the truth about my hands .
They throw knives , huh ?
How did you know that ?
I have no hands .
Yours , they were mine once .
I knew it .
He lied .
And so when you knifed your father in the back last night , you killed him with my hands .
I killed my father ?
No . No .
I threw a knife at him yesterday , but I ...
Last night .
Last night , I ...
- No .
- You remember now ?
No .
Pick it up .
Feel the balance .
Use it when they try to arrest you .
Who are you ?
I am Rollo .
- The knife thrower .
- No , no .
Rollo died in the guillotine .
Yes , they cut off my head , but that Gogol , he put it back here .
Arrest Stephen Orlac . 151 Avenue Colbert .
Wanted for murder .
Bring to General Headquarters immediately .
Repeat .
Stephen .
It wasn 't I who did it .
- It was Rollo 's hands .
- What is it ?
What 's the matter , darling ?
I 've murdered my stepfather .
I 've just seen Rollo .
You remember Rollo ?
They cut off his head , but Gogol put it back on .
It was Rollo who told me that I did it .
Stephen , my darling . You 're not well .
All this is some wild dream .
You 're with me now .
Everything will be all right .
So you don 't believe that these are Rollo 's hands .
All right then . I 'll prove it .
They may not be able to play the piano , but you watch how they can throw a knife .
Gogol .
That 's what it is .
He 's trying to drive you mad .
You can 't take him this way !
Pardon , madame . These men insist !
- They say they are from the police !
- The police ?
Yes , madame .
I 'm very sorry .
- Monsieur Stephen Orlac ?
- Yes .
In the name of the law , I arrest you for the murder of your father .
Murder ?
There must be some mistake .
It isn 't true .
When did this awful thing happen ?
- Last night .
- Stephen .
Tell her how my father was killed .
Stabbed with a knife .
Throwing knives seems to be a hobby of yours .
- No , no , no , please !
- It 's no use , darling .
All right , Officer .
I 'm ready .
If you like , I can put these on downstairs .
Thank you .
Wait !
I 'll go with you .
- I 'm sorry , madame , but ...
- There 's nothing you can do , darling .
All right , Officer .
No , no , there 's some mistake !
He didn 't do it !
Stephen , tell them !
You can 't , you can 't do this !
Stephen , my darling !
Let me go with you !
Monsieur Rosset , there are no two sets of fingerprints alike in the world .
These two prints are those of the same man .
How can that be , Varsac , when Rollo is dead ?
I don 't understand you at all .
You must have made a mistake .
There can be no mistake .
Fortunately , our case against Stephen Orlac doesn 't depend on fingerprints .
Here 's to you , Josephine .
Come on . You come in and have a party .
That 's your perch .
'Cause you say he 's a as vain as ...
You 're a jolly old girl Josephine
Well , I 'll tell you , if it 's that man again , I 'll show him .
I 'll show him what it 's like getting the doorknob with ...
That 's it .
Now I 'll show ...
How did you get out ?
Go upstairs quickly where you belong , before he comes back and finds you wandering around loose .
Upstairs , I say . Go upstairs .
Get up there because I 've got to see you in there before he comes back .
No , no .
Not in that one .
Get into that one . Get in the room .
I 'll get all the blame when the Doctor comes and finds you ...
But I must see Dr. Gogol .
Nobody answered at the clinic .
It talks !
It 's come alive .
- Please , I must see him .
- It 's come alive !
It 's come alive !
Dear , oh , dear , oh , dear . Oh , dear .
It went out for a little walk and then it started to talk .
I 'm not going back there .
- Not me . Not me .
- Who went out for a little walk ?
The wax statue .
It came to life , I tell you .
They often come back to life , and go out for little walks .
- Yes .
- They do ?
Now , you come for a little walk with us .
I know a doctor who wants to have a word with you .
Well , I never saw a statue come to life .
That fool .
He believes he murdered his father .
He 'll kill now .
Power of suggestion .
How easily it worked .
Triumph , Galatea .
Triumph .
He thinks he murdered his father , when it 's I who killed him .
Galatea , she 'll come here now , flesh and blood , not wax like you .
And he shall be shut up in the house where they keep the mad .
I , Gogol , will do that .
He shall be shut up when it 's I who am mad .
But nobody knows that .
Excepting you and me .
It 's our little secret .
And now I shall play to you , for the last time .
No , you don 't understand .
These are Rollo 's fingers , Rollo 's hands .
It was Rollo who told me that I killed him .
My friend , Rollo 's head was cut off months ago .
Yes , but Gogol put it back for him .
He took off his hands and put them onto my arms .
Look .
The fingerprints on the knife .
The prints of Rollo , and this man 's prints , they are all the same .
I got it .
Man without head kills rich jeweler .
What an eight-column spread that 'd be on the front page .
Why , that 's the greatest story since Lindbergh flew to Paris .
Oh , boy , it was only true .
Let me see those hands of yours .
Say , you were in a bad railroad wreck , is that right ?
Chief , I don 't like the marks on this guy 's hands .
You sent Rollo 's body to Dr. Gogol , and I 've been trying to find out for months what he did with it .
Never mind about his head , but I believe this hand stuff is true .
- You say you saw Rollo tonight ?
- Yes , and he 's got his head fixed up in a sort of steel and leather brace .
Rollo 's got his head back .
Orlac has got Rollo 's hands .
And what has Dr. Gogol got ?
If I don 't find out , I got no job .
Chief , let me talk to you a minute .
This is private . Come here .
Hey , Chief , that Dr. Gogol is 100 % / % crazy .
He tried to strangle me the other night .
You know why , don 't you ?
I found a woman in his house .
Now do you catch on ?
- But surely he ...
- Now , wait a second , please .
This is important .
You know who the woman is , don 't you ?
Yvonne , the actress , this guy 's wife .
Now do you catch on ?
It 's the old story .
The old family doctor 's stuck on a girl and tries to plant a murder on her husband to get rid of him .
He 's been doing something mighty queer with Rollo 's body .
I begin to think you 're right , Monsieur Reagan .
We 'll look into this immediately .
Order my car .
Now you 're talking .
There 's blood on your cheek , Galatea .
So it seems that wax can bleed .
Galatea , I am Pygmalion !
You were wax , but you came to life in my arms .
Dr. Gogol , please !
You speak .
You speak to me . My love has made you live .
Galatea ,
- give me your lips .
- Let me go ! Let me go !
René , René .
Don 't drive so fast , there 's no hurry .
Why are you afraid of me ?
I love you , I love you .
You came to life for me .
- Don 't you know me , Galatea ?
- Yes .
Yes , I am Galatea .
But let me go now , please .
I promise to come back .
- You are lying .
You wouldn 't come back . - No .
- You hate me .
You despise me .
- No . No .
Liar !
Hypocrite !
You disgust me !
But I love you !
Each man kills the thing he loves .
Each man kills the thing he loves .
Each man kills the thing he loves .
Yes , yes .
Each man kills the thing he loves .
Wait a minute .
My wife .
It 's wax .
And I thought I had a front page murder .
Help ! Help !
Yvonne .
- It 's locked .
- Break it open .
" And so I find a thing to do
" with all her hair
" In one long raven string I wind
" three times her little throat around
" and strangle her
" No pain feels she "
- It 's bolted from the inside .
- We 've got to get it open .
" I am quite sure
" she feels no pain "
He 's killing her !
Get out of my way !
Yvonne , are you all right ?
- Oh , Stephen .
- My darling .
I 'm sorry , gentleman and lady , but it will be best for you to stay here tonight .
Come now , my good man , you can 't frighten us .
We 've been over your foul roads before .
Please , you do not understand .
It is not the road .
It is the darkness .
Here our doors are protected with bat thorns .
- What is all this bat thorn business ?
- It keeps them out .
They 're afraid of it , the demons of the castle .
Good evening .
It 's a lovely evening .
Well , Doctor , for one who is not afraid of the dark , you have been pushing your horse pretty fast .
Well , you know horses .
Once they get started for home , there 's no stopping them .
I admit I was a bit impatient ...
I mean , hungry for one of your wonderful meals .
Yes , the vampires are hungry , too , for their supper .
Nonsense .
Rubbish . Vampires .
Nonsense .
I won 't keep you waiting .
I 'll be right out for my supper .
He can " tut-tut " all he likes about vampires , but I 'd hate to be on a farm needing his help tonight .
- What is all this about vampires ?
- Yes , and this castle .
That 's where they live in their coffins .
And they come out at night and drink people 's blood .
Silly superstition .
You would not laugh if you lived in these mountains .
Fancy , Ronnie , vampires in the 20th century .
Ripping .
They 'll never believe that at the club .
She says , " Please do not mock .
" Because if the vampires should hear you ,
" they would take their revenge on all of us . "
- Did you find out what was the matter ?
- Monsieur Baron Otto is coming .
One minute .
I have something to say to you .
I 'm the bearer of very sad tidings .
Last night your master , Sir Karell , was murdered .
There 's no cause for alarm .
Get up on your feet .
Police Inspector Neumann from Prague is upstairs now with the body .
He 'll be down here shortly to question all of you .
Now , tell him the truth and nothing can happen to you .
That 's all .
You can go back to your work .
In the University of Prague there are records , documents that prove the existence of these creatures .
Dr. Doskil , I 'm uninterested in your old wives ' tales .
I 'm trying to find the cause of Sir Karell 's death .
But you have it right here .
These little wounds on his throat are the bite of the vampire .
- Yes , you said .
- I have seen such marks in these parts .
Sir Karell dismissed you at 9 : 15 last night .
Yes , Mr. Inspector , yes .
Then what were you doing down here this morning at 3 : 30 ?
I don 't know .
I couldn 't sleep .
A bat was fluttering against my window , and I felt something was wrong .
A bat made you feel that way ?
Yes , sir .
No , sir .
I don 't know .
And you , why didn 't you come to the castle at once when Jan telephoned ?
Because Jan told me Sir Karell was already dead .
Does your medical license admit Jan to certify to the death of your patients ?
Oh , no , no . Of course not .
But it was night , and I realized there was nothing I could do .
Oh , I see .
You 're no moonflower .
You 're a morning glory .
Now , if there 's enough daylight to bring out the physician in you , make a thorough examination of the body for the cause of death .
Real , not supernatural .
Here , Jan , give the doctor a hand .
Why , the idea .
I 'll get your wrap , my dear .
We 'll step over to my place .
- You 've eaten nothing .
- Oh , the very thought of food .
I couldn 't .
I couldn 't .
But , Irena , you must conserve your strength .
- It 's Fedor .
- My dear , I 'll tell him .
No .
No , thanks .
Oh , where have you been ?
I 've been making enough noise to raise the dead .
Oh , don 't , Fedor . Don 't .
Well , what 's wrong , dear ?
What 's happened ?
Fedor , Father 's ...
Father ...
Oh , you poor darling .
This young man , tell me something about him .
Who , Fedor ?
Miss Borotyn 's fiancé , Mr. Vincenté from Prague .
- His family , wealthy ?
- Moderately .
Why ?
With Sir Karell out of the way
Miss Borotyn will come into quite a bit of money .
Why , surely you can 't suspect Fedor ?
What are Miss Borotyn 's immediate plans ?
Why , naturally , she 'll be moving next door to my place ,
I being her guardian .
- Oh , her guardian .
- Why , yes .
And being her guardian , naturally , you 'll be the sole executor of her estate .
Yes .
Why , what 's wrong ?
Oh , I see .
I 'm under suspición , too .
In such cases , everyone 's under suspición .
The idea of talking to me as though I were one of his common policemen .
" Old wives ' tales .
" Look for the cause of death .
" Real , not supernatural . "
- What ?
What is it ?
- Look .
Well , Doctor , what have you found ?
Inspector , the examination fully confirms my diagnosis .
Those marks are the only sign of violence .
Had Sir Karell been ailing of late ?
No , on the contrary , he enjoyed good health , except for a slightly sluggish heart .
- And you prescribed for that ?
- Naturally .
- Well , I shall want an autopsy .
- Of course , that will be done .
But I am positive .
The cause of his death is told by those little wounds .
Well , surely , Doctor , a man of your learning does not believe in vampires ?
Then how do you account for his body being drained dry of blood ?
Yes , Mr. Coroner .
In the night , Farmer Narodni was found dead in the road .
Count Mora and his daughter were seen again near the castle .
Oh , piffle .
Superstitious twaddle .
- Dr. Doskil .
- Yes ?
You 've examined the body of this farmer , too ?
I did .
The corpse was drained of blood .
There were the same marks that I found on Sir Karell 's throat .
And you have seen this Count Mora and his daughter ?
No , sir .
When I saw them , they was in form of bats .
These poor deluded creatures believe that vampires change themselves into bats and back again into human forms .
- How versatile .
- Really , Mr. Coroner !
" Poor deluded creatures . " I must protest .
- I hold a degree from the medical faculty ...
- Sit down !
Do you want to make your township and this court ridiculous ?
Forget your absurd old superstitions .
This is 1934 .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think that under existing circumstances the decisión of this inquest must be that Sir Karell Borotyn met his death from cause or causes unknown .
Darling , they 're doing all this for you .
Doesn 't it make you happy ?
- What ...
Why , dear , you 're crying .
- Boris , please drive on .
I 'm sorry , dear .
I didn 't mean to make you sad .
Forgive me , Fedor , for being so moody , but seeing them all dancing suddenly brought it all back .
How Father used to tell me that at my wedding feast all the villagers and peasants for miles around would come , and they 'd sing and dance .
Fedor , he had it all planned .
Now he isn 't here .
Darling , I 'll always try to make you as happy as your father wanted you to be .
The villagers and peasants would be quite satisfied with wine of the country .
It is just what Sir Karell would have done .
- Yes , sir , but for one thing . - What 's that ?
He would have had the wedding feast at the castle .
Come , Jan , do you think Miss Irena could bear to go back there ?
- After that dreadful tragedy ?
- I suppose not , sir .
But it 's heartbreaking to see the place neglected , rain and sleet entering through the broken windows .
I know how you feel .
Recheck your list .
Be sure we 've got enough of everything .
But you must remember life goes on , my dear .
Your father wouldn 't want these days , of all days , to be clouded for you .
I know .
I feel ashamed of the way I acted with Fedor last night , but it all seemed to sweep over me again .
Well , no more of that , young lady .
If I remember correctly , we have a wedding to prepare for .
Fedor !
Fedor , oh , darling , what 's the matter ?
Annie , some water , quick !
What is it , Fedor ?
What happened to you ?
I don 't know .
I can 't remember .
I was running to the train and then , by the castle , I fell .
I must have struck my head .
Oh , you poor dear .
Here , drink this .
Fedor .
You say you fell by the castle ?
When I came to , it was dawn .
I was too weak to move .
I just lay there .
It seems ...
It seemed hours before I was able to drag myself here .
Annie , the doctor , quick .
Dr. Doskil .
Fedor !
Those wounds , like Father 's .
Vampire !
Vampire !
Let me out of here !
Slow down !
Slower !
- Are you trying to kill me ?
- Let go ! Let go !
Slow down !
Slow down !
I 'm not gonna be upset in no ditch !
And I 'm gonna tell the Baron how you 've been beating his horse .
It 's all your fault , taking so much time over your beer .
I told you we had to get home before sunset .
Why are you afraid of the dark ?
The darkness won 't hurt us .
If you wake up dead in the morning , your body drained dry of blood , you 'll be afraid of the dark !
Afraid of the dark .
Heaven .
Heaven , protect us .
Oh , heaven .
I 've been a good girl .
I 've been a good girl all my life .
Don 't let her get me .
She 's got me !
She 's got me !
We must see him !
We must see him !
- But you can 't !
You can 't disturb him now !
- We 've got to see him .
He must be told what we saw .
I must warn you .
You cannot disturb him now .
- What is this ?
What is this ?
- The castle , sir !
It 's haunted , sir .
Dead people !
- Jan , close the door .
- We saw them !
We saw them !
- Yes , we did , sir !
- Keep quiet .
I 'll explain .
- Some real-estate brokers from Prague ...
- No , no .
We saw a woman .
- A dead woman in her grave clothes .
- That 's enough !
What you probably saw was one of the broker 's clients inspecting the castle .
The place is being shown for rent .
Oh , excuse me , sir . I 'm new here .
I want no more disturbances in this house .
- Understand ?
- Yes , sir .
Miss Irena has gone through enough excitement .
No , sir .
Yes , sir .
I 'll keep my tongue .
What is it ?
Boris !
Oh , Boris .
What happened to her ?
What 's she doing out here ?
I don 't know !
I couldn 't find her .
I looked all over and there ...
I don 't know !
I don 't know !
I felt her deadly , cold breath on my throat .
I must have fainted .
I knew no more .
Colleague , your diagnosis is correct .
Professor Zelin .
Gentlemen , I 've spent my life in the study of ...
Miss Borotyn , will you excuse us , please ?
May we continue our talk in another room ?
- Maid .
- Yes , sir . Yes , sir .
Go to Miss Borotyn .
Stay with her .
- Under no circumstances leave her .
- No , sir .
Professor Zelin , why all this secrecy ?
I broke off my sentence for Miss Borotyn 's sake .
There is no more foul or relentless enemy of man in the occult world than this dead-alive creature spewed up from the grave .
True .
True .
This attack by a beautiful woman on Miss Borotyn goes far to confirm the legend of the castle .
Who else could it have been but ...
- The daughter of Count Mora .
- Exactly .
My very own conclusión , Professor .
- What is your advice ?
- We can 't undo what 's been done .
Miss Borotyn is in danger of repeated attacks .
Come in , please .
It 's Inspector Neumann .
Excuse me .
Baron Otto , I must speak to Inspector Neumann before he leaves !
Please .
You should be lying down .
Miss Borotyn , you must come away from there .
I 'm afraid you treat me like an invalid .
Maid , quick .
The doors , the windows .
I want everything closed and fastened securely .
- Every moment counts .
Run along now .
- Yes , sir .
Yes , sir .
Dr. Doskil , there 's a certain thorny weed
- that grows in these parts .
- Yes , yes . Bat thorn .
That 's it .
That 's it . I want you to get me some , if you will , please .
We 'll have to work fast .
The sun will soon be down .
Yes , yes . Very good , sir .
With my permissión , a broker in Prague leased the castle .
Look .
Look at the signature of the tenant .
Karell Borotyn .
Some relative , no doubt .
- No , no , it 's Karell himself .
- What 's wrong with you , man ?
Sir Karell 's been dead for a year .
It 's his signature , I tell you .
I know it as well as my own .
Inspector Neumann .
Your arrival is providential .
We need his help the worst way .
Inspector , Miss Borotyn has been attacked by a vampire .
Well , I suppose coming from you this is no joke .
But you know I don 't believe in such things .
Why have you sent for me ?
Why were you instrumental in bringing me down here ?
Please , Professor , no argument .
I can 't stand any more of this .
- I 'm too excited .
- I beg your pardon , Baron .
Sorry , Baron .
I 'll tell you why I brought you here , Professor .
I thought you 'd help me uncover the truth .
Why , the facts speak for themselves .
There have been three attacks .
Sir Karell is dead .
Miss Borotyn and her fiancé lie within the shadow of worse than death .
The vampire is a pestilence that grows .
Each victim that it kills itself becomes a vampire .
A corpse by day , at night it leaves its coffin to sustain its unnatural life on the blood of the living .
Inspector , we must protect this house with bat thorn to prevent their entrance .
Baron , I have sent for a supply .
If you will pardon me , I 'll see if it 's arrived .
Inspector , do you really think ...
Miss Borotyn , you should not be down here .
You must not disregard my warnings .
But I heard a voice , outside , calling me .
It 's your weakened condition , child .
No .
No , it sounded like Father , Father 's voice .
Come .
I 'll take you back to your room .
Did you hear what she said ?
Her father 's voice .
Hysteria .
I place no stock in it .
His signature . His signature on that lease .
Now don 't you start believing that nonsense .
Dead people don 't leave their graves .
But , Inspector , we must make sure that Sir Karell 's body is still in its coffin .
Fedor , you 're not well enough .
You promised me not to come tonight .
What are you trying to keep from me ?
Who is this man ?
Oh , I 'm sorry .
Professor Zelin .
Professor , Mr. Vincenté .
You 've been so ill , dear .
We thought it best not to let you know .
- But now that you 're here ...
- Please , please .
You 'll overtax your strength .
Mr. Vincenté ,
Miss Borotyn must be spared all excitement .
She 's passed through a terrible ordeal .
Like you , she was attacked by the vampire .
The vampire ?
She must have rest .
She 'll get rest .
I 'm taking her away from here tonight . Now !
Mr. Vincenté , if you interfere with my plans , if you disobey me , my work will be destroyed .
Why , it 's not only your lives , your souls are at stake .
We must all die .
There 's nothing terrible about death , but to live on after death , a soul earth-bound , a vampire .
You don 't wish any such fate for your beloved .
- No , of course not .
- Of course not .
- Then you must leave with me .
- I 'm not leaving here .
Please , dear .
Do as he says .
I 'm so tired .
Good night .
Maid , maid , come here , please .
Yes , sir . Yes , sir .
I want you and the butler to place some of this bat thorn in every room on this floor . You understand ?
- Yes , sir . Yes , sir .
- Go along .
Come , young man .
Don 't do that .
He wants some of this put in every room in the house .
- Oh , yes , you ?
- No , we .
The vampire 's power prevails during the hours between sunset and sunrise
- when it leaves its coffin .
- Professor .
- We 've just come from Sir Karell 's tomb .
- The coffin was empty .
- Irena !
Irena !
- Fedor !
Fedor !
- Darling .
What happened ?
- Oh , my dear .
What happened ?
Stop jittering .
What are you trying to say ?
Oh , it was terrible .
It was awful .
- Quiet , please . One at a time .
- Speak up .
Tell me what happened .
Yes , sir .
We were told to put some of the bat thorn in every room .
We had just come out of that door and started down the hall ...
I don 't like it .
It 's a horrible business .
I wish he 'd hung the beastly stuff up himself .
We 'll get it over with .
- He was there .
Coming towards us .
- Yes , yes .
He had a white face , a dead white face , with burning eyes
- and a ghastly wound on his head .
- It was Count Mora .
- Yes , yes .
- Have you been drinking ?
No .
No , sir .
If I have , I hope to choke on the next one .
This is no time for levity .
The vampire , he is still somewhere within this house .
Young man , place some bat thorn at this door and lock it securely .
- Yes , sir .
- Maid , butler , search the rooms at that end of the house .
You mean go into those rooms ?
- Yes , you idiot .
- Hurry .
Baron Otto , we must drive him out of here .
Quick , Inspector , we must search the rooms at this end .
In that room , Baron .
Quick , Inspector , we 've no time to lose .
Maria , Maria , don 't leave me .
- Inspector . Inspector , what is it ?
- He got through the window .
- Did you ... - Baron , Inspector , come here .
- Please , quick .
- What is it , Professor ?
What is it ?
Look .
Was that he ?
The last one ?
- Who ?
- Sir Karell , her father .
- Her father ?
- Why , yes .
Didn 't you find his coffin empty ?
No , no , I can 't believe that .
I won 't believe that .
Inspector , please hurry .
Place this at these doors .
I 'll attend to the others .
- Professor .
- Baron , a moment .
Baron , there are things going on in this house that I don 't like .
- What do you mean ?
- Well , this weed , the way the Professor 's acting , I don 't like it .
Well , I 'm bewildered .
I no longer know what to think .
I 'm afraid , Fedor , afraid to close my eyes .
There 's nothing to be afraid of .
We 'll be here with you , watching over you .
No , no , no . We must go .
We can 't remain here .
She must have quiet .
She must have sleep .
Her exhausted body demands it .
Miss Borotyn , the maid will be here with you .
But I dread every moment between now and morning .
Dismiss all fear from your mind .
The room is quite safe now .
The organ .
That music .
He was always at the organ .
Sounds like it comes from the dead .
This window .
It 's Sir Karell .
- Are you sure ?
Are you sure it 's Sir Karell ?
- Yes .
The night will soon be spent and nothing accomplished .
Well , are we going to sit here and think , or are we going to do something ?
Incredible .
Incredible .
If Sir Karell ...
I still maintain Miss Borotyn 's the only one who can influence her father .
- Are you mad ?
- Good heavens , no .
Can 't you understand ?
She mustn 't even know her father 's there .
Of course not .
- Vampires or no vampires , I 'm going to ...
- What are you going to do ?
- Call headquarters for help .
- Yes , surround the place , set fire to it .
Fire , an army of police , a hurricane of bullets would do no good .
You seem to forget that during the hours of darkness the vampire can 't even be harmed , let alone destroyed .
If they can 't be destroyed , then we 're wasting time .
I didn 't say they couldn 't be destroyed . They can .
By day the vampires must return to the ground in which they were buried or else find shelter in some accursed retreat .
It is then they are powerless .
Then we must leave at daybreak .
It 's our chance to get away from here .
What ?
And leave these monsters here to continue their work of destruction ?
- It would be cowardice .
- What else is there to do ?
Search for them . Find their corpse-like bodies .
It is in that state and that state only they can be destroyed .
Their heads must be severed with one clean stroke and a sprig of bat thorn placed within the gaping wound .
We would be crazy to attempt what you 're planning .
I 'll never do it , never .
In the morning , we 're leaving .
I agree with you .
Yes ?
Yes .
2 : 30 .
In three hours it will be daylight .
Oh , thank heaven the house is well protected for the night .
Come , gentlemen , let 's go to bed and get some rest .
I had gone to bed as you said .
I laid here for hours trying to go to sleep .
But I was restless . I couldn 't .
Then I heard Maria leave the room .
Why did you leave the room ?
You had your orders .
To get some coffee to keep me awake .
You fool .
And after Maria left the room , then what happened ?
I heard a sound like wind at the casement .
I felt a draft .
Then I saw her , just as she was on the terrace .
I fought to keep my eyes open , but they closed .
I felt again that deadly , cold breath .
The horror of it made me feel faint .
There , there , my child .
That young man , go to him . Hurry .
That cross I told you to wear ... Maid , get it immediately .
Put it about her neck .
- Wake up . Come on . - Go away .
What ? What 's the matter ?
- What 's wrong ?
- Fedor , are you ... Are you all right ?
Something 's wrong .
Irena , what 's happened to her ?
Mr. Vincenté , quiet , please .
Fedor , Irena , she 's been ...
Miss Borotyn is asleep .
Quick , Inspector , close that door , please .
Why are you here ?
We 've been watching through the night , but now the dawn is here .
We wanted to be sure that you were safe before we retired .
I felt drowsy .
I must have fallen sound asleep .
Sound ?
You were in a stupor .
We had to shake you .
Stupor ?
Tell me , this deep sleep , did it refresh you ?
Why , yes . Why do you ask ?
What are you doing ?
I just wanted to look at the wounds on your neck .
That deep sleep was unnatural .
Fortunately , he wasn 't harmed .
When the maid screamed out to us , it must have frightened the monster away .
Gentlemen , we must face the truth , the horrible truth .
Miss Borotyn is in their power .
To save her we must break the spell .
If we don 't succeed in destroying those monsters by sundown , we may be too late .
- Quick , get into your clothes .
- Come , Baron .
Professor .
Professor Zelin .
In here , Inspector .
- Have you searched thoroughly above ?
- Yes .
Not so much as a mark on the dust-covered floor .
Same over there at the organ where you saw Sir Karell playing .
The dust lies thick and undisturbed .
That 's what makes it so difficult to find the vampire 's hiding place .
Well , don 't let 's stand here talking .
Let 's go on looking for them .
You 're quite right , Inspector .
Have you some matches ?
Yes .
Oh , look .
No , no , no , no , no .
Up there on the rod .
Stop , you fool .
Would you destroy what might give us a clue ?
Smash it . Take no chances .
No , no , no . That would do no good .
It 's only in its own corpse-like state that it can be destroyed .
Now , we must search the vaults beneath the old ruins .
Come , we have not much time left before sunset .
- You have matches , Inspector ?
- Yes , Professor .
Yes .
Professor Zelin , are you all right ?
- Professor .
Professor Zelin . - Here .
Please , hurry .
Quick , Inspector , get the candle .
We must find the others .
No , no .
Don 't leave . Destroy him first .
Stop him !
Have you gone mad ?
One more stupid act and we 'll be lost .
Please , please don 't leave him like this .
And expose ourselves to the vengeance of the others ?
Why , their fury would follow us to the ends of the earth .
No , we must destroy them all together .
Come .
Inspector , put a mark on that door so we 'll know his hiding place .
- Quick , matches .
- Wait , please .
We 'll be trapped in here . Hurry . The sun is going down .
I 'm staying here until you come with me .
I won 't leave you .
Fedor , you must go .
If you love me , please do as I ask .
Inspector .
Inspector .
The fool .
Fedor , we 're being silly .
Don 't let 's argue , darling .
We 'll just forget all about it .
Now , you run along downstairs .
I want to get out of this negligee .
I haven 't had a dress on for ages .
- Irena , I don 't understand you .
- You silly boy , what 's wrong ?
Last night you were terrified and tonight you 're ...
- You 're gay and cheerful .
- Are you sorry because I 'm happy ?
Yes ? Come in .
Those doors .
Those doors .
They shouldn 't be open .
They should be closed .
The bat thorn .
Oh , Miss , you know the Professor said that you shouldn 't ...
Go away , Maria .
Leave us alone .
It 's all right , Maria .
You can go .
I 'm with her .
- Oh , mister .
But , mister ... - No , run along .
Just run along , okay ?
What 's the matter with everyone , worrying about a silly weed ?
Irena , I 've got to know why you 're acting like this .
What are you hiding from me ?
- Don 't ask me , please .
- But I have a right to know .
There 's something wrong with you .
You 're not yourself .
Irena , look at me .
Irena , I feel that I 'm losing you .
Fedor , forgive me .
Forgive me for what I am doing .
- Darling , tell me .
Tell me .
- Fedor , I ...
- No , no , no , no .
- Irena .
Irena !
Irena !
Inspector Neumann .
Inspector Neumann .
Be brave , my child .
I 'll try .
Then go with Luna .
No , no .
Don 't go up .
But don 't you see ?
If Sir Karell was in life the kindly , benevolent person you describe , your lifelong and devoted friend , you could go to him .
You could appeal to him .
No , no .
I can 't .
Go away , Fedor ! Go away ! Go away !
Irena .
Irena !
Everything is getting cloudy .
Getting cloudy .
You understand ?
Getting cloudy .
You 're going upstairs .
You understand ?
You 're going upstairs .
- No , no .
I can 't do it .
- But , Miss Borotyn .
I can 't go on .
But you must .
You wouldn 't fail us now .
- Miss Borotyn .
- Inspector .
Inspector Neumann , I can 't go through with it .
He looks so much like Father , even his voice .
I 've been willing to do all the other things you 've asked of me , but this ...
This is more than I can endure .
But don 't you see this is our last chance ?
Everything else has failed .
But you both said Baron Otto would break down and confess if we confronted him with this gentleman pretending to be my father .
I know , we all thought our vampire scheme was so simple , so certain of success .
We never thought we 'd fail .
I 'm sorry .
But , Miss Borotyn , after the attack on Mr. Vincenté , it was you who first suspected the Baron of the crime .
We are positive you are right , but we lack definite proof .
If you fail us now , we will never know .
But to live through those moments again , to act as if you were my father , alive and with me ...
Don 't you see the horror of it ?
It 's one year ago .
One year ago . You understand ?
One year ago .
You 're going to see Sir Karell .
You understand ?
You 're going to see Sir Karell .
Miss Borotyn , get ready .
Baron Otto will be here any moment .
I 'm afraid you can 't count on me .
Oh , no , no , no , my dear child , you must be courageous .
I admit what we 're trying to do is only an experiment , but I feel certain , now that we have the Baron hypnotized , he will reenact his crime if he 's guilty .
Baron Otto is at the door , sir .
Oh , please . Without you , we 're helpless .
I 'll do my best .
Inspector .
Jan ,
I want you to do exactly as you did the night of the murder .
- You understand ?
- Yes , sir .
- Omit nothing .
- No , sir .
Let him in .
- Good evening , Jan.
- Good evening , Baron .
- How 's your rheumatism ?
- It 's gone , sir .
- Thanks to the fine weather we 're having .
- That 's good .
Now , we 'll soon know if my theory is correct .
I hope you 're right .
I 'm anxious to know how he drained that body of its blood .
Yes .
- Irena , I 've never seen you more lovely .
- Oh , thank you , dear Baron .
- No , Karell , I 'm only staying a moment .
- It will do me good to stop for a smoke .
Speaking of smoke , that reminds me , those pipes I ordered from London have come .
Yes , they came this afternoon and they are beautiful .
- Well ...
- Now ,
- any three of them are yours . - Three ?
I 'll be satisfied with one .
Now that 's like the one you gave me two years ago .
- Now , Father , don 't work too late .
- No , no .
- And don 't forget your medicine .
- I won 't .
- She knows you , Karell .
- I know you both .
- Good night , Father .
- Good night .
- Good night , Baron .
- Good night , Irena .
Put it here on the desk , Jan.
Jan , three drops of this in a glass of water .
- Yes , sir .
- Now , what about the third one ?
There , there , there .
- Now ...
- Karell ,
I was surprised when Irena told me this afternoon .
I thought you weren 't going to consent to her marriage to that boy .
Well , now , if I weren 't here , you 'd be her guardian .
What would you have done ?
I would have said no .
I never would have given my consent .
I 've always hoped that we had other plans .
What do you mean , other plans ?
Well , that she would marry someone more worthy of her , someone nearer her station in life , who could give her what she 's accustomed to .
Why , you know she 'll always have more than enough .
Haven 't I arranged for that ?
- How soon is the wedding ?
- Within a fortnight .
A fortnight ?
Karell , will you let me have Irena 's ruby necklace ?
There may be time to have bracelet and earrings made to match .
And you would have said no ?
Why , you 've spoiled her since the day she was born .
Jan , help me here .
Now , where did I put that necklace ?
- There it is , my good friend .
- Thanks , Karell .
I 've been keeping you from your work long enough .
- No , no .
I 'm glad you came over .
- Good night .
Good night .
- Good night , Jan.
- Good night , sir .
Quick . Get through one of those rooms and watch the window on the terrace .
Yes .
Well ?
- He thinks he 's drugged your wine .
- I know . I saw him .
Jan , come here .
Tell me , did Sir Karell drink the wine before he dismissed you ?
No .
No , sir .
- You 're positive ?
- Quite .
Drink it , collapse , and then we 'll see what happens .
All right .
- Put these pipes in my room , Jan.
- Yes , sir .
I don 't think I 'll be wanting anything more tonight .
- Very good , sir .
Good night , sir .
- Good night .
Stop !
Don 't move , Baron !
Look at me .
Look me in the eye , Baron .
That 's it .
Everything is getting cloudy .
Cloudy .
You understand ?
You are returning , returning to the present .
You are returning to the present .
Baron .
Baron Otto , you 're under arrest for the murder of Sir Karell Borotyn .
You were very clever in concealing the motive of your crime .
We never dreamt it was Miss Borotyn you were after .
Franz , take him out to the car .
I don 't get the idea of his heating the glass .
Only to cup him with , to cup him of his blood .
That hot glass over the wound creates a powerful suction .
Forgive me , Fedor , but they wouldn 't let me tell you .
They were afraid that you wouldn 't let me go through with it .
This vampire business , it has given me a great idea for a new act .
Luna , in the new act I will be the vampire .
Did you watch me ?
I gave all of me .
I was greater than any real vampire .
Sure , sure , but get off your makeup .
Yes , and help me with some of this packing .
Eight o 'clock .
All 's well .
Misty weather .
- Here ye are , me lad .
- Thank ye .
A press gang .
A press gang !
- The press gang !
- Let 's get out of here !
In the king 's name !
Well , we got all the fish we need in one net .
- Line them up , boatswain .
- Aye , aye . Line up , lads !
Lads , bow your necks and weep .
You 're in the king 's navy .
I 'm no seaman , sir. I 'm a tailor .
What 's that , your needlework ?
No chin music .
- What ship , sir ?
- The Bounty , for the South Seas .
- That 's the end of the world .
- No , he sailed there with Captain Cook .
He knows the brown gals gay as kiss-me .
- Who 's the captain ?
- Bligh .
- Bligh !
- Seize him !
How long will we be gone ?
Till there 's enough frost in hell to kill snap beans .
How long is that , sir ?
I 've got to know .
Two years , lad .
Please , don 't take my husband .
When we had a baby , Tommy left the sea .
He don 't want to serve in the navy .
- lt 's true , sir .
- Sorry , the king needs six men .
You can 't take him !
It 's like forever !
I can 't take them and not take him .
No , you can 't take him !
I won 't let you !
- Lass , lass .
- lt 's two years !
No !
It 's two years !
This is England 's new venture in science , in trade , in discovery .
Who else but Sir Austin Byam 's son should go ?
But two years .
- l understand , my dear .
- Ship ahoy !
Bob .
Behold !
The elder son of the sea and heir to all its oceans .
Uniform by Jeeves .
It 's so new , it creaks .
I 'll come back an admiral , with a necklace for you .
Pearls as big as coconuts .
I 'll name a nice shiny island after you , Sir Joseph .
- l owe you for my appointment .
- You 've been appointed for one purpose :
To make me a dictionary of the Tahitian language .
I 've made that clear to Captain Bligh .
- What 's he like , sir ?
- Captain Bligh ?
He 's a seagoing disaster .
His hair is rope yarn .
His teeth are marlinespikes .
Marlinespikes ?
Good .
Sounds rather terrifying .
But perhaps , as your father used to say :
" A taut hand at sea is better than a slack one . "
You 'd have made a rare sailor , ma 'am .
Why don 't you stow away , Mother ?
I 've considered it .
Very seriously .
Well , here 's to the voyage of the Bounty .
To the voyage of the Bounty !
Still waters and the great golden sea .
Flying fish like streaks of silver and mermaids that sing in the night .
The Southern Cross , and all the stars on the other side of the world .
Bless my soul .
To the voyage of the Bounty !
is that the Bounty ?
No , sir . That 's the flagship of the fleet .
There 's your little pint-pot .
That 's the Bounty for Tahiti ?
She isn 't very big , is she ?
It ain 't the size that counts , youngster . It 's the salt in the lads that man it .
- Where 's your sweetheart , handsome ?
- She married a sailor .
It 's Ellison , sir .
He tried to break ship .
On deck , Morrison .
Churchill .
Aye , sir .
Break ship , would you ?
I can 't face it , sir .
Not two years .
I might not come back .
Then she 's left with the baby .
Flog me , send me to jail , but don 't take me , sir !
Don 't .
Now , listen to me , Ellison .
The sea 's hard , but you whistle it off .
Do your spit and polish and you 'll come home with the seals following in admiration .
I was like you when I first came to sea , Cumberland moss all over me .
Now it 's turned to barnacles .
That 's better .
On this voyage , if you get in trouble , come to me. I 'll see you get justice .
But if you 're wrong , look out for squalls .
Now , get your chin up .
Go on deck . Say goodbye to your wife .
- You 've got her aboard , sir ?
- And the baby .
- Come on . Shake a leg .
- Thank you , sir .
- So you 're going to the South Seas , Jack ?
- Aye . Here .
Take this with you .
You can buy your own island .
Ten shillings .
Ten ? I ain 't seen the king 's face on a shilling for so long I 've forgotten which George it is , but I 'll take it and pay you when I get back .
Sailor ! You 're not coming back , not in this little half-walnut .
Here you are .
Diamond brooch .
Real gold , mister , owned by Captain Kidd .
With a map of the treasure under the works .
Here . Stand clear with the tinware , Joe .
You keep leeward of the ship 's gentlemen .
All right , now .
Ta-ta .
Ta-ta !
Mr. Byam ?
I 'm Fletcher Christian , lieutenant and master 's mate .
- You 'll be my instructor .
- Yes , in navigation and trigonometry .
You 'll have a watch , keep order , go aloft to mend canvas , reef and furl .
Otherwise , your time is your own .
Mr. Christian , in my hands , the ship is safe .
I understand .
" A little child shall lead them . "
Come along , I 'll show you below .
You there , take Mr. Byam 's box to his berth .
- Ahoy , Mr. Christian !
- Ahoy !
Excuse me .
Good morning , sir .
Nothing lost , Mr. Christian .
Think I 've got enough for a two years ' voyage ?
- You know your draft better than I do .
- My lad , nobody can estimate my draft least of all myself .
- Easy , easy .
- What makes her roll so ?
Here 's a navy for you .
Rum in the skimmers today and blood in the scuppers tomorrow .
This is our ship 's surgeon .
We call him Mr. Bacchus .
- He 's never told us his real name .
- l 've forgotten it . Pleased to meet you .
Mr. Byam , I should never have gone ashore .
England 's only an island , and all islands are alike .
I 'm going below .
Bear a hand .
Easy , now . Easy .
Oh , Tommy , I 'm afeard .
This ship 's unlucky .
They 've changed the name .
Well , I changed your name , didn 't I ?
Was that unlucky ?
Oh , Tommy .
One , two ... .
Three of us in here ?
My dog at home has a bigger kennel all to himself .
I can see we shall be as friendly as tomcats in a sack .
Mr. Stewart ?
Mr. Byam .
Drop in anytime , Byam .
I 'll be just 1 0 inches away from you .
- A pleasure , Mr. Stewart .
- l hope you 'll like the ship .
- l 'd like any ship , Mr. Stewart .
- Johnny Newcomer .
Oh , yes , Mr. Byam , the amiable Mr. Hayward .
- How do you do ?
- Mr . Hayward has been two years at sea .
And a man who 's been two years at sea should know how to lash his hammock .
Yours looks like a Frenchman 's knapsack .
All right . On deck , all of you .
Mr. Maggs ?
This here Captain Bligh , sir .
Now , you being ship 's clerk would you call him a gentle officer ?
If I was you , I wouldn 't be calling him anything .
Oh , no , no , no , Mr. Maggs , no .
Never call anybody anything .
But I do hope he is gentle because I 'm his messman and I frighten so easy .
It runs in our family , Mr. Maggs .
My mother was frightened by my father before I was born and I 've been frightened ever since .
Do you know , Mr. Maggs , there 's times when I can hardly hold a glass in my hand ?
Silence .
The captain 's coming aboard .
Company , atten !
Mr. Christian , clear the decks of this rabble .
Very good , sir .
Clear decks .
Everybody ashore . Clear decks .
- Mr . Fryer , we sail at six bells .
- Sail at six bells .
- We got our rights here .
- Off ship , Joe .
Off ship . I 'm not going until the ship sails .
Hey , you can 't do that !
Flogging through the fleet .
We 're included .
Quite a compliment to the Bounty , Sir Joseph .
Mr. Christian , pipe the ship 's company at five bells to witness punishment .
Would you care to see the flogging ?
No . The only discipline I know is science .
There 's science in using a cat-o ' - nine-tails .
Watch my boatswain . I really must be off .
I came aboard merely to introduce Roger .
Goodbye , my boy .
This won 't be all cakes and ale , Roger but your family 's followed the sea for seven generations .
Not one ever failed in his duty .
In a tight place , that 's all you 'll need to remember .
- l 'll try to , sir .
- Sure you will , my boy .
- Goodbye , Mr. Bligh .
- Goodbye , Sir Joseph .
What does it mean , sir , " flogging through the fleet " ?
Sentence of court-martial , two dozen lashes at each ship .
What was the man 's crime , sir ?
Struck his captain .
But that 's over 300 lashes .
I don 't understand why- -
Can you understand this ?
Discipline 's the thing . A seaman 's a seaman , captain 's a captain .
And a midshipman is the lowest form of animal life in the British navy .
Now you know what a midshipman is .
Line up !
Port oars !
Ship 's company , off hats !
Article 22 : " lf any officer , mariner or other person in the fleet shall strike or offer to strike any of his superiors and being convicted , he shall suffer punishment inflicted on him by the sentence of a court-martial . "
Ship 's company , on hats !
- Mr . Morrison , two dozen , I believe .
- Two dozen it is , sir .
- The man is dead , sir .
- Shall I dismiss the men , sir ?
- What ?
Certainly not . We 'll proceed with punishment .
Boatswain , do your duty .
Come along with you .
Bloody murderer .
Mr. Byam !
- Punishment counted out , sir .
- Mr . Morrison , come aboard .
- Mr . Fryer , make ready to sail .
- Starboard watch , secure for sea .
Starboard watch , shorten and cable !
Stand by to go aloft !
In captain 's gig , Mr. Christian .
Both watches , hoist !
Hoist away !
Way aloft !
Winds offshore !
You 'll take the mizzenmast , Mr. Byam .
What 's the matter , afraid to go aloft ?
Why , it 's child 's play . That man they flogged .
He was dead .
Get aloft .
Bear a hand .
Mr. Morrison , start those men .
Tallyho !
Child 's play .
Anchors aweigh , sir .
Let fall !
Down from aloft !
Down from there !
A dozen for the coat of the last man down !
Please , sir !
Skipper Hayward !
Mr. Hayward !
- l 'll take care of him .
- Keep hold ! Hoist away !
Set courses , royals and gallants !
Royals and gallants !
Starboard bridges , aweigh with the anchors .
- Ship ready .
- Give her lee helm . Lee helm , sir .
- Steady .
- Steady , sir .
There she goes .
Her anchor 's up . Oh , Mary , it 's such a little ship .
My Tommy will bring her home .
Hurrah !
Hurrah !
Hurrah !
Well , we 're under canvas again , Mr. Christian .
- lt 's our third voyage together .
- Not of my choosing . So the port admiral told me .
Well , you 're here. I requested you .
I like having a gentleman as my subordinate , being a self-made man .
I admire you for that , sir .
And for very little else ?
Sailing orders ?
Tahiti direct by Cape Horn .
Winds permitting .
If we can 't make westing , we shall have to go by Africa .
Then we 'll have to get supplies at Simon 's Bay .
We 'll need them . This ship has less food than a prison hull .
And I don 't trust that clerk of yours .
Who asked you to meddle with my clerk ?
Can 't get much from a hungry man .
I have to work these men we feed .
Rascals and pirates . Did you see them growl at the flogging ?
I 'll teach them what flogging 's like .
My advice , sir , if you 'll take it , is not to be too harsh with them .
We 're sailing 1 0,000 miles together for the next two years .
- lt 's like a powder magazine .
- l don 't want your advice .
I 've my own way with seamen .
They respect one law , the law of fear ...
- ... and my officers should remember that .
- l can only tell you what I think !
They come from jails and taverns , but they 're English and they 'll sail anywhere .
I 'm not interested in what you think .
I expect you to carry out whatever orders I give , whenever I give them .
I 'll carry out your orders , Mr. Bligh .
Then we understand each other ?
Perfectly .
- Any orders for the deck ?
- That all ?
- Yes . You may go . Thank you , sir .
- She 's flying , Mr. Christian .
- Tahiti direct , sir .
Tahiti direct , Mr. Christian .
Pass it on : No change of sail without my orders .
Put two men at the wheel .
We 'll carry on or carry under .
- Southeast by east .
- Southeast by east , sir . No change in sails except for captain 's orders .
Mr. Byam , you 'll stand by for midshipman 's school .
Aye , aye , sir .
You !
Hold up , there ! Never empty your buckets into the wind !
Find the wind , you idiot !
Find the wind and then choose your rail .
Get below !
We 're off around the world , boys .
Light hearts and tight britches .
Off around the world . Oh , dry up , you cub .
is it human , or what do you think ?
I can 't stand yowling water babies .
Blast you ! I told you not to swing that lantern !
You don 't mean it makes you seasick ?
An old buccaneer like you ? I 'll knock more tar out of you than it 'll take a month to mix .
- Come on , blowhard .
- Oh , stow it , will you ? I can 't make head or tail of this navigation .
Don 't worry. lf you get tangled , I 'll jump in and pull you out .
- You 'd better not try and fool Mr. Christian .
- Mr . Christian holds no terrors for me .
I can wade the seven seas and never wet my shirt .
They have whales that can sink a ship , but I can sink the whale .
Behold , the face that launched a thousand ships .
Gentlemen .
Today 's navigating problem :
Given the altitude of Polaris , could you find your latitude , Mr. Stewart ?
To lead up to it ordinarily , the shortest distance between two points is a straight line .
But this is not true of navigation . We must consider winds and currents- -
Yes . Suppose you considered the problem .
Yes , sir .
Perhaps Mr. Stewart means that it 's like that lantern , sir .
We assume it should hang straight down , but because the ship is rolling it swings to and fro .
But by watching it closely- -
You disagree with Byam , Mr. Hayward ?
He knows the lantern makes me seasick .
He 's doing it to break up the lesson .
- Stewart doesn 't know his problem .
- Still , his original theory interests me .
Please , sir .
Proceed , Mr. Byam .
You were saying , by watching the lantern closely- -
What seems to be the trouble , Mr. Stewart ?
Watch the wind , Mr. Stewart .
It 's not there. lt 's there .
is that the face that launched a thousand ships ?
One navigation problem and three wrecks .
Smart as paint , you are .
Why , you ungrateful swab .
After I 've given my all for the honor of the class .
Byam !
It wasn 't my fault .
He came behind and struck me .
- ls that true , Mr. Byam ?
- l 'd rather not say , sir .
So you want to fight ?
I 'll cool you off . Get to the masthead and stay there until I call you down .
- All the way , sir ?
- Get below or go aloft !
Rather heavy weather to send him aloft , isn 't it ?
They must learn this isn 't a beer garden .
If you don 't teach them , I will ! Look alive , you crawling caterpillar !
- Where 's Byam ?
- l couldn 't help it , Stewart . When the man looks at me , I want to jump overboard .
Where 's Byam ?
- The old man sent him aloft . - You let him take the blame , huh ?
Here , here !
You 've started enough trouble !
Time you learn discipline ! Get into your hammock before I put you over a gun !
Get up !
You see , sir ?
It isn 't my fault . They 're only jealous because I 've been at sea before .
Who did that ?
I did , sir . Come here .
Good .
How she creaks .
Wind 's a gale . I 'm too old to envy young Byam aloft .
- Splice the main-brace , Mr. Morgan .
- l 'll take it to kill germs .
What ?
Waste my brandy ?
Here , you use the ship 's drinking water .
Did you ever hear how I lost my leg ?
- No , no , but we will .
- Well-- - l 'm worried about Byam .
- Oh , he 'll weather it all right .
Well , I left my leg with John Paul Jones back in ' 78 .
We came astern with a Yankee . Up went our colors and our captain hails , " What ship is that ? "
" American ship Ranger , " roars Jones , and up go his colors .
" Louder , you Yankee pip-squeak , " our captain yells .
" l can 't hear you ! " " Can you hear this ? " says Jones , and he lets go a broadside .
Thundering guns .
You all right ?
- Nothing lost , Mr. Christian .
- Look after him , Mr. Morgan .
Keep her head up !
Starboard !
Get him below , to the surgeon !
Mr. Christian !
- Who brought that man down ?
- l did , sir !
But I sent him aloft !
He 's gone under .
The top 's no place .
I know his place .
Time you knew yours . Maintain discipline , not break it !
Send him aloft again !
Mr. Bligh , he 's had enough ! Send him aloft again !
That 's right , lad .
Drink another .
You 'll be as right as a truism .
If you 'd lost a leg , now ... . l lost mine in action against the French , off Jamaica .
A French surgeon did the trick for me .
He apologized in French , and I cursed him in English .
- How is he ?
- l 'm all right , sir .
He 'll go anywhere .
Get to the masthead again , Byam .
- l 've taken my punishment , sir .
- Get to the masthead ! I 've had a bellyful of that masthead from Captain Bligh !
You can 't make me go back up there again !
It was Mr. Christian brought you down , lad .
Thank you , sir .
I didn 't understand .
- You mind ?
- No . Let him have it .
Here , you 'll need this .
Here 's something else you 'll need .
You 're a plucky youngster . If necessary , I 'd be happy to cut off your leg anytime .
Thank you , sir .
- lf anything happens to that lad , Bligh will- -
- Christian !
Ship 's company , off hats .
O , eternal god , who alone spreadest out the heavens and rulest the raging sea , who has compassed the waters with bounds until night and day come to an end receive into thy almighty and most gracious protection the persons of us , thy servants and the fleet in which we serve .
Preserve us from the dangers of the sea that we may be a safeguard unto our gracious lord King George and his kingdoms and a security for such as pass on the seas upon their lawful occasions and that we may return in safety to enjoy the blessings of the land with a remembrance of thy mercies to praise and glorify thy holy name through Jesus Christ our lord , amen .
- Amen . - Ship 's company , on hats .
The ship 's company will bear in mind we are at sea under the articles of war .
Perhaps you are unaware that the articles of war invest in me the authority to order punishment .
During the recent heavy weather , I 've watched you at work on deck and aloft .
You don 't know wood from canvas , and it seems that you don 't want to learn .
Well , I 'll have to give you a lesson .
You , you , you , step forward . You three are a disgrace to saltwater !
Ten days on half rations .
What 's your name ?
- Thomas Burkitt , sir .
- He 's a thief , sir .
Dartmoor Prison .
- A thief .
- Convicted . Offered a choice :
- Dartmoor Prison or the king 's navy .
- You 've been to Dartmoor Prison , Burkitt ?
- Yes , sir .
- lt seems you prefer the navy . You may regret that choice before this voyage is over .
Your name ?
Thomas Ellison , sir .
Pressed into service .
I 've got a wife , a baby . I asked your name , not the history of your misfortunes .
Your name ?
- Smith .
- Not you , you idiot !
- William Muspratt , sir .
- Have you got a wife , Muspratt ?
Have you got a wife ?
The ship 's company will remember that I am your captain , your judge and your jury .
You do your duty and we may get along but whatever happens , you 'll do your duty .
Go forward .
Thief . Nobody calls me a thief but the men I steals from .
Half rations .
You there !
Who did that ?
I can 't tell you , sir .
- Mr .
Morrison . - Aye , sir .
Report that man for two dozen lashes .
I done it , sir .
Put it back .
- Mr .
Morrison , lay on with a will .
Bligh , these men aren 't king-and-country volunteers .
They 've been brought aboard by press gangs .
In a week , I 'll get some spirit without flogging .
Teach them who 's master and never let them forget .
- Mr . Morrison ! - Aye .
Before we see port , I 'll make them jump at a midshipman 's jacket even if it 's hung on a broomstick to dry .
Give this man his two dozen .
- l didn 't hear the watch call , sir .
- Sorry , I was cleaning brass for Mr. Byam .
- That 's true , sir . Stretch this man over a gun and give him two dozen lashes .
- But I was responsible , sir .
- Byam will be in charge of the punishment .
Two dozen .
That 's enough , Mr. Morrison .
- Man overboard !
- Bring a line ! ldiot. I 'll have to teach my top men not to fall off the ship .
Mr. Morrison ! When you get him onboard , stretch him with a rail to dry him off .
I can 't stand it. I got to get water .
Get back to your work .
I wanted water for my knees , sir .
I can 't stand it .
Please , sir . - What is it ?
- This man left his work , sir .
Wants water .
Look , sir , it 's the sand worked in cruel .
- l wanted water to wash it .
- l 'll give you water .
Mr. Morrison , keelhaul this man .
- Well ?
- The man is dead , Mr. Bligh .
Mr. Bligh , I 've seen calms and doldrums , but not one like this in 40 years .
- The men in the boats are worn-out .
- Not the way they 're pulling .
- Put new men into the boats .
- Mr . Morrison , pipe the men .
Change crews .
Dive in with your mess , lads .
The boats are alongside .
Mr. Byam , look at this bit of meat , sir. lt 's alive .
I 'm sorry , lad .
There 's nothing I can do about it . This bit of meat was mined in a rock quarry .
- Here , I 'll change with you , lad .
It 's alive , all right but they 're fresh meat anyway .
Mr. Byam , I 'm reporting these two men unfit for duty .
You men are relieved .
- What 's the delay here ? You realize we 're waiting for these men to pull us into a wind ?
The men haven 't finished mess , and these two are unfit for duty .
- Unfit ? ! - My orders , sir .
If they can walk , they can work . Put them in the boats and get these other men out immediately .
Any sign of a breeze , sir ?
I 'm about at the end of my rope .
Keep up your stroke , man .
Can 't we ... ?
- Can 't we rest a spell , sir ?
This is the cask with only one cheese in , sir .
- What 's this ?
What 's this ?
- Two cheeses are gone . - What ?
- Two 50-pound cheeses missing .
- Stolen , of course , sir .
- Thieves and jailbirds !
- A hundred pounds of cheese gone .
They 'd steal canvas off a corpse .
- Strange. I checked the stores myself .
- Cheeses can 't fly , fool !
They 've been stolen , of course .
Stop allowance of cheese until the theft is made up .
Begging your pardon , sir .
Back in Portsmouth that cask was opened by you , and Mr. Maggs had the cheeses carried ashore .
- Perhaps you 'll recollect , sir .
- Maggs had me take them to your house .
- You insolent scoundrel ! But I remember very well , sir , because I didn 't get to see my wife that day .
Boatswain , spread-eagle that liar to the rigging till sundown .
- Aye , aye , sir .
- Wind off the starboard bow , sir .
- Man the lee board braces !
Well , Mr. Christian , if your rascals are any good , bring us into the wind .
Boats !
- Pull , lads ! Pull !
- Lay into it , now . Get up .
Send her up , Burkitt .
Pull ! Mr. Byam , pull up their strokes !
Pull !
Pull ! - Mr .
Hayward , speed up !
- Mr .
Byam , use your rope 's end !
- Come on , lads , pull !
- Come on , pick them up .
Pull !
We 're almost in !
Put your weight in it !
Good lad , Muspratt .
We 're in !
We 're in !
Shall I call the boats in , sir ?
They 've done their job .
What do you expect me to do , knight them ?
Hoist the boats . - Aye , sir .
- Good , lads ! Good , lads !
Well , we are out of the doldrums at last , sir .
I told you to spread-eagle that liar .
Why hasn 't it been done ?
Very good , sir .
There 's nothing more powerful than brandy .
I threw a brandy bottle overboard once , an empty one , off the coast of Madagascar .
Three years later , I picked it up in a river in Portugal .
It had gone back to its home vineyard for more .
You would 've made an excellent historian .
You have a profound contempt for facts .
I don 't despise facts , sir , I 'm indifferent to them .
Water .
Water .
Cheese , Mr. Christian ?
No , thank you , sir .
- Mr . Byam ?
- Mr . Fryer ?
- No , thank you , sir .
Perhaps the surgeon wants cheese .
No , thank you , sir .
To the best of my recollection , Mr. Christian , you 're partial to cheese .
Burn me. I believe you 're with the men .
If you 'll allow me , I think you 've been unjust .
- Unjust ?
- A bit of cheese , more or less .
Unjust ?
In other words , you say I 'm the man who lied .
- l didn 't say that , sir .
- You implied it .
I 've no doubt that Maggs disposed of the cheeses without your knowledge but I can 't understand your treatment of the man who obeyed orders .
Maggs is my clerk. lt 's not for my men to question his orders .
Nor for you to question mine !
I want your apology .
I have nothing more to say , sir .
Then you can dine elsewhere on what you can get !
- Mr .
Gentlemen .
Come , he implied it , didn 't he , Mr. Byam ?
Well , I can also dispense with your company !
So you 're all against me , officers and men .
Won 't eat cheese , eh ?
Before I 'm done with you , I 'll make you eat grass !
I 'm so hungry , if my mother would reach out to pet me I 'd have a bit of her hand .
There 's fish there , all right , but they 're making jokes about the bait .
If I could prove what I suspect , l- -
No , I wouldn 't .
I 'm so weak , I 'm peaceful .
Muspratt , Burkitt , look here , supper .
What ?
Why- -
Why , Mr. Christian , sir .
Take a look at this , sir .
Supper for six men .
Four pounds , they calls it . If that weighs more than 2, I 'll eat the cat-o ' - nine-tails .
- lt ain 't pig. it 's horse meat .
- We pulled our hearts out for this breeze .
- And what do we get ? We starve .
- Well , little meat , no distemper . Keep the wind in the sails and out of your stomach .
If it 's any comfort , the officers are in the same boat .
Not Captain Bligh .
He 's getting fat , the dirty , thieving- -
Burkitt ! Any more of that , and I 'll clap you in irons .
Yes , sir .
Buckoes .
Buckoes .
Here 's your supper .
- Thompson , get your hook and line .
- Right . See him ?
- Here you are , Burkitt .
- Right . Well , we 've got to have bait . Sharks ain 't seamen .
They expect to eat .
- You want to risk this for a meal ?
- Aye . - l 'm willing .
- Yeah . If the hook don 't kill him , that pork will .
Let it go .
There he goes .
- Got him .
- On deck with him . - Easy , now .
Easy , now . Easy , now .
- Hold him .
- Aye . - You first , Burkitt .
Choose for your mess .
- Thanks , mates . - Yeah , fine catch you 've got there .
You know I must have a slice , eh ?
- Shark eat shark ?
- You forget yourself . You give me a slice , a nice , large one , and I 'll say nothing .
Tell him , you slimy quill-pusher .
At ease , lads .
At ease . Well , how 's our shark-killer , huh ?
He 's cut to bits , sir .
He 'll be all right .
What 's a flogging ? A few blows and a few " ohs , " and then you put on your shirt .
- Here .
- Thank you , sir . Now , if you 'd lost a leg , my lad ... .
l left mine with a Spanish pirate off the coast of Trinidad .
A bullfighter did the trick for me . He was so drunk he nearly cut off the wrong leg .
Hey !
You 'll be all right .
A bit tattooed on the back perhaps , but just the right style for Tahiti , eh ?
- Hey , fiddler , give him a tune .
- Aye , sir .
- Good night , lads .
Listen , Byam . You can flog those fellows , starve them ...
- ... but they 'll bob up again with a fiddle .
- Music at sea I never imagined how beautiful it was .
Master-at-arms , stop that infernal jamboree .
- lt 's worse than two cats on a fence .
- Aye , aye , sir .
The old death 's-head . I 've never known a better seaman , but as a man , he 's a snake .
He doesn 't punish for discipline .
He likes to see men crawl . I 'd like to push his poison down his own throat .
You both have one thing in common , the devil 's own temper .
He can let his go but whether I can keep mine bottled up for the next two years is a question .
I believe you will . Whatever happens , I 'll always be glad I 've known you .
I 'll remember that when you 're an admiral .
Good night , youngster .
- More tea , sir ?
- No , you get out .
- You sent for me , sir ?
- Yes , I 've got a job for you this morning .
- Sit down .
Had your breakfast ?
- Yes , thank you , sir . I want you to sign the list of all supplies issued on the voyage .
Certify and sign .
We should raise the island anytime now .
Not a bad voyage so far .
All hands accounted for .
Only six down with scurvy .
Five with scurvy , one with flogging .
Correct , there 's your credit .
Five with scurvy , one with flogging .
We 're still under canvas .
Mr. Bligh , I can 't sign this book .
No such amounts have been issued . You 've signed daybooks with extra kegs the ship never carried .
- l have , sir .
- And why not ? We all do it .
We 'd be fools if we didn 't on a lieutenant 's pay . I want to stow away enough to keep me out of the gutter .
I understand , a captain 's prerogative .
Ordinarily , I wouldn 't mind .
Why is this case different ? The captains I 've served with didn 't starve their men .
They didn 't save money by buying up the stinking meat .
They didn 't buy yams that would sicken a pig .
Silence ! They didn 't call their men thieves and flog them in the bone .
- You impudent scoundrel !
Sign that book !
- l refuse and you have no authority .
I haven 't ? ! I 'll show you authority .
Lay all hands aft ! All hands aft !
Company , attend !
Mr. Christian , step forward .
" lf any officer or other person in the fleet shall disobey any lawful command of any of his superior officers , every such person being convicted of such offense shall suffer death or other punishment as shall be inflicted on him by the sentence of a court-martial . "
Mr. Christian , you will sign this book .
Mr. Bligh the ship 's company will bear witness that I sign in obedience to your orders .
But remember , sir , I shall demand a court of inquiry in England .
You mutinous dog .
- Retract that , sir .
- l will repeat it .
You 're a mutinous dog .
- Mr .
Christian .
- Land ho , sir !
There she waits , lads !
- What is it , Mr. Fryer ?
- Tahiti , you fool .
So you 'll face me with a court of inquiry ?
We 're a long way from England and what can happen on this ship before we get there may surprise even you .
Milk !
It 's milk ! Captain , they got cows here that lays eggs .
What a place .
Would you help me up , sir ?
I 'd like to see the island .
What for ? All islands are alike .
That 's a singularly stupid observation , sir , and grossly unscientific .
Well , science is one thing and experience is another .
- You see one island , you 've seen them all .
- Fiddlesticks . Well , I 'm to be first ashore .
Captain 's orders , to begin my dictionary .
I 'll get my trade goods .
We can go ashore together .
All right , then .
- l know that man .
- Who is he ? A friend of Captain Cook 's when I was sailing master .
Hitihiti , chief of the island , priest of the temple .
Pipe him aboard .
- Mr . Fryer , dress ship .
- Very good , sir .
Bligh .
- Bligh .
- Hitihiti . Oh , yes .
Yes . - Bligh , you got fat .
- Oh , well , it is 1 0 years since we sailed together with Captain Cook .
- l beg your pardon ?
- Where Captain Cook ? Captain Cook is dead .
- Morti ?
- Yes , yes , morti .
- He was a good man .
- Oh , yes . Hail King George .
King George ?
Captain Cook say King George come on next English ship .
His Majesty is extremely sorry he couldn 't come .
I beg your pardon ?
My hat .
Captain Cook say if King George don 't come , he send hat .
Yes , yes , yes !
Of course , the hat .
Mr. Maggs , go to my cabin and bring me the hat- -
- The cocked hat , you fool !
- Yes , sir . The hat will be here in one moment .
So we shall require 1 000 breadfruit plants .
- Breadfruit ?
Uru .
- Correct , uru .
Uru . - All we have for you .
- Thank you , thank you .
We shall have to stay here for several months .
We shall have provision- -
- They 're welcome to anything .
- Don 't be a fool . - You 'll need those gifts to make friends .
- Him no need gift , my friend .
- Me Hitihiti , you my tayo .
- Tayo ? - Chief makes you his friend .
- ln my tongue , close friend .
You live home , my home .
Tayo . Friend , the finest word in any language .
- lt shall be the first in my dictionary .
- The hat .
Yes , thank you .
With the compliments of His Majesty King George lll of Great Britain .
- Byam , you come ashore with me .
- Sir ? Permission granted , mind you report onboard ship every night .
- Byam will live with my family .
- lmpossible . - l can have no favorites aboard my ship .
- Bligh , you are chief on this ship but I am chief on that island .
Byam will come with me , yes ?
Perhaps that 's best .
Permission granted .
By the way , Mr. Morrison , pipe the ship 's company aft .
Aye , aye , sir . All hands aft .
Well , we 're here .
Tahiti at last . England to Cape Horn , Africa , New Zealand Van Diemen 's Land and the great South Seas .
I 've sailed the Bounty over 27,000 miles and you think you 've come to an island paradise a tropical grog shop of feast and song and sleep .
Well , you 're wrong !
You 're here to labor .
You 'll fill this ship with breadfruit trees .
You 'll recondition her for sea . Shore leave permitted if and when I can spare you .
If you abuse it , you 'll answer to me .
And remember , your work is finished when we drop anchor in Portsmouth Harbor .
- Mr .
Fryer will have charge of work ashore .
- Very good , sir .
Mr. Christian , you will remain onboard in charge of reconditioning the ship .
Unfortunately , you will have no shore leave while we 're here at Tahiti .
That 's all .
What a place .
Hey , when 's dinner ?
Your language is most un-English .
It means exactly what it says . Here are three pages on your words meaning " look . "
- Plenty kind of look .
- That 's the trouble . There 's one for the downcast eyes , one for the sidelong glance one that invites , one that consents .
A whole language of looks .
Byam , you think too much .
One day , you head go crack .
No , no , no , Tehani. I 've told you before .
I like my flowers in a bowl .
What do you call that look , Byam ?
The look of a charming girl who will still be happy when we English invaders go home .
By the way , what 's your word for money ?
Money ?
What is money ?
All right , I 'll explain . Now , which would you choose ?
The shilling or the nail ?
Oh , no , Hitihiti .
With one of these you can buy 20 of these .
- Oh ? Where ?
- Well , in England . You see , in England , you must have money to live with to buy food . In island of England , no fruit on tree ?
- No fish in the sea ?
- Oh , yes . Plenty .
No money , no food ?
- That 's right .
- l stay here .
Byam , ahoy !
Sounds like Christian .
- Well , it can 't be .
- Maybe so . Hitihiti , you got him leave !
Byam !
- Ahoy , Robinson Crusoe .
- Fletcher ! I 'd given up on seeing you ashore and Hitihiti never even winked .
When he came aboard wearing that hat , even the articles of war failed Mr. Bligh .
Christian .
Christian .
Lieutenant .
Thank you for speaking to the captain .
The sea is good , but the earth is good also .
Be at home .
It 's good to be ashore again .
- Well , can you speak Tahitian yet ?
- Like a native .
Why , you little powder monkey ! If you cross my hawse again , I 'll spank your little starboard , understand ?
- Yes .
- Yes ?
- Well , I didn 't know you speak English .
- Yes . - You must think me a perfect fool .
- Well , does she or doesn 't she ?
Mr. Byam , your Tahitian dictionary .
Madam .
This is Hitihiti 's granddaughter .
- What did she say ?
- You must be a king in your own country .
What ? If His Majesty could see her as I see her now , he 'd forgive the error .
- Shall I tell her that ?
Byam your friend is wise . He looks , he understand .
You make word , you understand nothing .
No work today .
Go swim , all .
Come along , Fletcher. I 'll show you an island you 'll never forget .
- You can 't imagine what it 's- -
They 'd like to come with us , if you don 't object .
Christian ?
Aren 't they amazing ?
I never knew there were such people in the world . They 're simple and kind , and yet , somehow , they 're royal .
What did you say ?
Nothing .
I 'm sorry . I was just thinking what a contrast to the ship .
Tehani wants to race me .
- Oh .
- What 's wrong ?
He comes from the ship .
- Captain Bligh 's orders .
- Bligh ?
You 're to report onboard immediately .
Oh , I am ?
Byam , I know his game ! He gives me leave and recalls it to devil me into insubordination .
Well , I 'll oblige him !
I 'll have one day off that ship if I swing for it !
What did she say ? The man will tell Captain Bligh you can 't be found .
Oh , thank you .
She says you were magnificent , like a storm at sea .
- Thanks for your kindness .
- You will come again ?
- That rests with you and the captain .
- You will come again .
Byam , it 's been a day .
Goodbye , Maimiti .
- Goodbye , all .
- Good morning , sir .
- Good morning , Mr. Stewart . Mr. Bligh wishes you to report to him as soon as you come aboard , sir .
Thank you , Mr. Stewart .
- Reporting , sir .
- You relieve my anxiety .
I was about to send an armed shore party to look for you .
- l had your permission , sir .
- You 're a fine figure of a king 's officer .
If I could prove to that native you 're a liar , they 'd arrest you !
You 'll regret this !
Before this voyage is over , you 'll know who 's master here !
Mr. Bligh , I have in mind the dead seaman you had flogged in Portsmouth .
He struck his captain .
You 'd like me to strike you .
- Well , I won 't do it .
1 000 pounds , sir .
The pick of the island !
Mr. Morgan , I shall commend your industry to Sir Joseph Banks .
Thank you .
There 's one difficulty , sir , a very grave one .
These growing plants require more water than we can store aboard .
We can 't let them die , sir .
We won 't .
I shall cut the water allowance for the entire ship 's company .
Good morrow to you .
I 'll drink your health in Portsmouth !
- Put your stuff there .
- lt 's mine , sir. lt 's a gift .
Captain 's orders .
Put it down and go forward !
Shore leave in heaven , duty in hell again .
- What have you got there ?
- Monday Wash , sir .
It 's a pet , sir . Her name 's Monday Wash .
Mr. Maggs , take that laundry for the captain 's table .
But , sir !
Now get forward !
- Come along , there .
Hurry ! - Did he hurt you ?
- No , but one day , I 'll take that cane away- -
Yes .
Aren 't you coming aboard , Hitihiti ?
I have said farewell to Bligh .
I have sent gift to King George .
- Then this is goodbye .
- Yes . Byam , tayo .
- You have been happy here ?
- Very happy , Hitihiti .
Byam , I have no son .
Stay here with me .
I must return to England .
I shall never come back .
Byam ...
Roger !
Will you come here , please ?
- Look .
- Big as gooseberries !
Please make her understand . These are priceless , I can 't take them .
She says they 're for your mother .
Oh . Well , thank her , Roger .
And tell her when this voyage is over , somehow , I 'm coming back .
- l can 't tell her that .
- l mean it , Roger .
But it 's a dream , Fletcher .
This island isn 't real for you and me. lt 's the ship that 's real .
- lt 's taking us home . - Tell her , Roger .
Thank you , Roger .
Goodbye , Maimiti .
That 's right .
No tears , lass .
Love ?
Love .
Goodbye .
Reporting with deserters . Taken on the other side of the island .
No resistance .
Very well , Mr. Young .
So you let them take you alive .
You 'll regret that , me lads .
Take them below . We ain 't deserters , sir .
You kept us aboard because we dropped that tub of breadfruit .
- We wanted to see the island- -
- Take them below and put them in irons .
Prisoners in escort , into file .
Left , turn !
Quick march !
- ls she ready for sea , Mr. Fryer ?
- Ready , sir . - Set topsails and jibs .
- Stand by . Topsails and jibs .
All hands on deck !
Looking about me , I can 't believe we 're in a ship of the royal navy .
The deck 's like a barnyard !
Paradise is astern , gentlemen .
I 'll break the men of that island if I have to flog every thieving-
- Which reminds me 1 0 coconuts , Crown property , were stolen on your watch .
Am I correct , Mr. Maggs ?
- l counted myself .
- l 'll account for the men in my watch .
- They didn 't take them .
- Can you account for yourself ?
Mr. Bligh , may I recall the outward voyage ?
Harsh things were said , but I hoped the return trip would be better .
Then suppose you return the 1 0 coconuts .
- You think I 'm so fond of them I 'd steal ?
- Yes , you hypocrite . - You stole Crown property more valuable .
- Explain that !
Pearls , Mr. Christian .
- Pearls ? - l believe I said pearls .
Fortunately , Mr. Maggs was at the boat .
He saw that native woman give you two pearls .
I think I 'm beginning to understand .
The native woman , as you call her , gave the pearls to me .
- They are not Crown property .
- The goods I gave away to the natives belong to the Crown .
What comes back from the natives belongs to the Crown !
I 'm not the most patient man in the world .
Remember , Mr. Bligh :
Crown property .
Very well , Mr. Christian .
Crown property .
- Gratings rigged .
- Everybody present ? - Everyone present , sir , but the surgeon .
- The surgeon is ill , sir .
- lll ? Drunk , you mean !
- We had to bleed him this morning , sir .
He 's not fit .
Mr. Morgan and Mr. Christian agree .
Go below . Tell him to report on deck at once !
Very good , sir .
Thomas Burkitt , Matthew Thompson , step forward .
Ship 's company , off hats .
I 'm sorry , sir .
Captain Bligh ... .
How do you feel ?
I 'm afraid I 'm a very old man , lad ...
- ... and a very sick one . - l 'll tell him again you can 't report .
No , boy . No , I 'm not worth getting into a scrape over .
For once , a midshipman gives an order .
You stay where you are .
A good lad .
A good lad .
I must pull him out .
I 've taken the liberty of telling the surgeon to stay , sir .
He 's not able to report . I 'll have no drunken relic holding up the discipline aboard my ship .
Once more , Mr. Byam , bring him on deck , or I 'll have you seized up and flogged .
Byam doesn 't wanna disobey you. I beg you , don 't force the old man .
He can 't walk . - Go below and see for yourself .
- Are you presuming to give me orders ?
Reporting on deck for duty , sir .
Mr. Morrison , do your duty .
Four dozen , I believe .
Four dozen it is , sir .
Nothing lost , Mr. Christian .
- Well ?
- What did you expect , Mr. Bligh ?
The man 's dead .
I call this ship 's company to bear witness .
- You killed him !
- Silence . Ship 's company dismissed .
Boatswain , punishment postponed 24 hours .
Aye , aye , sir .
Do you hear , men ?
Ship 's company dismissed !
Bear a hand .
Drunkard ?
Yes , but everybody loved him .
The welfare of men on shipboard depends upon things that seem small .
A joke at the right moment .
A glass of grog .
A kind word would do more with seamen than the cat-o ' - nine-tails .
And this ship will be the worse if possible , for his death .
Wonder if that 's Defoe Island .
The natives are cannibals but it 's land .
The last we 'll see for months .
You 'd better get some rest .
You 've been here for hours . No. I can 't sleep , and it 's nearly my watch .
- Well , good night .
- Roger . - There 's something I want you to do for me .
- Gladly .
One never knows what may happen on a voyage like this .
If for any reason I don 't return to England , I want you to see my parents .
Well , why shouldn 't you return to England ?
Why ?
I can 't stand this devil 's work much longer .
One day I 'll forget this discipline and break his neck .
Wait until we 're back in England .
The admiralty will save you the trouble .
Well , in any case , I 'd like you to see my parents .
- Of course .
Where do they live ? - ln Cumberland at Maincordare .
I 've almost forgotten what the old place looks like .
I haven 't seen it in 1 0 years .
But I do remember a tapestry in the hall with ships and islands on it .
Perhaps that 's what sent me off to sea .
I don 't know .
In any case , I 'd like you to see my home .
If anything should happen , tell my father and mother you knew me .
- You can count on me . - Good .
That 's settled , then .
- Mr .
Byam , you 're up late .
- lt 's fairly warm below . I hadn 't noticed . A true sailor can sleep in an oven or on a cake of ice .
Get below . Very good , sir .
Your watch , Mr. Christian .
And I must count the coconuts .
Mr. Christian , sir .
That shark 's been following us since the surgeon died , waiting for the burial .
- Couldn 't I have a musket to shoot it ?
- Take the deck .
- l 'll get the keys to the arms chest .
- Two muskets . I 'd like to shoot that shark onboard .
It 's no use .
Now 's our chance . There 's a lot of us here ready .
And the officers and men that won 't join us ... .
- Well , it 's them or us !
- Keep your hatch closed ! Now , get forward !
Who 's there ?
Sailor hand , mate .
- Hey , what 's this noise about here ?
- Water , mate .
Water ?
- For deserters ? - But the lad slipped his cable .
Well , here 's to you slipping yours .
When I 'm free , I 'll wring your scrawny pipe stem till your tongue pops out !
Tongue , is it ? I 'll give you something to remind you of that slice of shark .
You scum !
I 'm sorry , lad .
Are you all right ?
Thank you , Mr. Christian , sir .
Better take care of Thompson , sir .
Murdering butcher !
I 've had enough of this blood ship !
He 's not master of life and death on a quarterdeck above the angels .
McCoy !
Quintal !
I 'm sick of blood !
Bloody backs !
Bloody faces !
Bligh , you 've given your last command !
We 'll be men again if we hang for it !
You say you 're ready for anything ?
Release them !
- You 're taking the ship ?
- Mutiny ?
Yes , mutiny ! Pass the word .
Seize the arms chest .
No !
Take him !
Boatswain !
No , no , don 't hurt me !
Now , wake up ! Get into your clothes and lose no time about it .
- What 's the matter ?
- What 's happened ?
- Have we been attacked ?
- No , we 've taken the ship .
And old Bligh 's a prisoner .
Tie him to the pipe .
Mr. Morrison !
Mr. Coleman ! Shut up or I 'll shut your trap for you !
Give up this madness , or we 'll all be murdered .
You 're in no danger .
What will we do with him ?
- Shoot him !
- l 'll slit his dirty throat ! See that , you butcher ?
My four dozen .
We 'll give you 400 . - We 'll let you know what it feels like !
- Flog him !
You old rogue .
You 'd flog us .
You 'd make us eat grass . You bluenosed baboon !
Back !
Back , all of you !
No more flogging aboard this ship .
That 's why we 're taking it .
We 'll have something to say about that !
What will you do with him ?
Put him in a launch and cast him adrift . Give him food , water , cutlasses and a compass .
You can have your choice .
Go with him or stay with me .
No . Slit his throat , I say , and feed him to the sharks .
And I say go forward !
Clear the launch and lower away !
Aye , aye , sir .
- Stand by , Thompson .
- Aye , aye , sir .
Lively , old buzzing bees .
What a pity , what a pity !
Every little tree , perfect .
- You 'll be sure to water them , won 't you ?
- Never you fret .
We 'll take care of your plants , here , Morgan !
You may stay onboard if you like , without joining us .
No , thank you , sir .
All right .
Your turn , Mr. Bligh .
Mr. Christian , I give you your last chance to return to duty .
I 'll take my chance against the law .
You 'll take yours against the sea .
But you 're taking my ship !
My ship !
Your ship ? The king 's ship , you mean , and you 're not fit to command it .
into the boat !
We 're ready , Churchill .
McCoy !
Two little monkey jackets .
Loyal to Captain Bligh , eh ?
- Serves them right .
I tell you , we will !
Mr. Christian , you forgot us .
Call back the boat .
There 's no more room .
You must stay with us .
- We 'll join our captain !
- We 're not mutineers !
I said there was no more room !
Stand the guns on them !
Give them a drink !
Casting me adrift 3500 miles from a port of call .
You 're sending me to my doom , eh ?
Well , you 're wrong , Christian !
I 'll take this boat as she floats to England if I must !
I 'll live to see you , all of you hanging from the highest yardarm in the British fleet !
Yardarms , is it ?
I 'll give you yardarms .
You 're not leaving them adrift ?
They 'll starve or drown .
- That 's Bligh 's affair .
- Your friends , Morgan , Purcell- -
Do you think I wanted this ?
- Call back the boat .
- No .
- Call it back ! - No ! These men have been in hell .
I couldn 't stand it .
- Then I must go with Bligh .
- There 's no room .
Then I call on you men . All of you , in the name of the king , return to duty .
Cock-a-doodle-doo !
Give me that gun !
Take him below .
Stand by to wear ship .
- What course , sir ?
- West-northwest , Tahiti . Tahiti , lads !
Tahiti !
Hey , Thompson !
Sit down , Roger .
You know , there are five other men onboard who refused to take part in the mutiny .
They 've agreed not to try and retake the ship .
You may have your liberty under the same conditions .
I simply want your word for it .
You may have it . But I 'll escape if I can .
I understand .
Then I may go ?
Yes , you may go .
Roger I 'm sorry I had to hit you .
That didn 't hurt .
What hurts is that you and I can never again be friends .
Keep her as she goes , west-northwest .
West-northwest , sir .
I presume you 'll make for the nearest island . No .
That 's certain death .
The savages in these parts are fierce cannibals .
We must keep well clear of those fellas . By my reckoning , the first port from which we can expect help is Timor in the Dutch East Indies , some 3500 miles away .
Then our case is hopeless .
It is by no means hopeless .
We have extra canvas , rope , a tool chest .
We 'll put on every rag of sail we can .
That 's impossible . Deeply laden as we are , we 'd fill with the first storm .
Then we 'll bail with our hands if we must .
She 'll see us through if we do our part , she will !
Begging your pardon , sir , but the food and the water .
We haven 't got enough for 1 0 days . If we are to reach Timor alive , we must make it last 20 , 40 , 50 days .
It 's the sea against us .
Mr. Bligh , we 'd be pleased if you 'd ask God 's blessing on our journey .
That I shall do , Mr. Fryer .
Almighty God , thou knowest our need . Grant that we acquit ourselves like men in the trials and dangers that lie before us .
Bail !
Bail !
Bail faster !
Bail faster !
Another piece , Mr. Maggs .
Thank you , lad .
Are we all served ?
All served , sir . Now , lads , for your own good , eat and drink slowly .
How far have we still to go , sir ?
Don 't let your mind dwell upon that , lad .
Think how far we 've come .
We 'll never see Portsmouth again ? We 'll see Portsmouth again and we 'll see Fletcher Christian hanging from a yardarm and every pirate with him .
Steady , mates .
Mr. Fryer , take the tiller .
Get away !
I caught him ! Hey , lads !
Give me that bird ! Share and share alike , lads .
The blood for the sick .
Raise him up , Mr. Maggs .
Norton , get me a cup .
This will nourish you , Mr. Morgan .
No , thank you , sir .
Give it to the youngsters .
They need it more .
Yes , Mr. Morgan , but I 'm still giving the orders .
Timor , up ahead .
Timor !
Up with you .
We 've beaten the sea itself .
I hope Master Roger has a nice Christmas , ma 'am .
Thank you .
- Well , good night , ma 'am .
- Good night , ma 'am .
- Good night , ma 'am .
I beg your pardon .
Will there be anything more ?
- Nothing more , Burrows .
Christmas ?
Yes , Christmas .
Peace on earth , goodwill to ... .
Come along .
A merry Christmas to you , Mrs. Christian .
Thank you , lads .
A merry Christmas to you all .
- Same to you , sir .
- Merry Christmas , Mr. Christian .
- Roger !
- Merry Christmas , Fletcher .
Oh , thanks , lad. I 've been hoping for this for a year .
Come in .
This is a day worth celebrating .
Begging your pardon , sir .
We 've brought the little lady a bit of Christmas .
Well , thanks , lad .
But she must have it from you .
Come in . Come in , lads , all of you .
- Thank you , sir .
My boy was like that when I left home , sir .
Come on , lads .
Everybody outside for some grog .
Thank you , sir .
Help yourself , lads !
Thank you , sir .
The surgeon 's , Roger .
It would delight his soul to have us drink it , especially on this day .
Friend .
Good , good . Hitihiti , here .
Makes head go round , round .
Come on , Byrne , drink some of this !
Where 's Ellison ?
Ellison ! Come on !
What ?
A ship ?
- Maybe she 's Spanish .
- No . - No , she 's British-rigged .
- British ?
Did you hear that , mate ?
British . - British ?
- She 's coming for us .
We 've got a chance .
The wind 's against her . She must lay outside the reef till morning .
Get your families and your goods together !
Thompson , everyone onboard ?
Burkitt and Muspratt have gone into hiding .
The fools !
They 'll be taken and hanged .
Get in the boat .
Where are you taking us ?
I don 't know . The Pacific is filled with uncharted islands .
We 'll find one and settle there for good .
Mr. Christian , I 've got a wife and child in England. I 've got to get back .
Back ? You know what that means ?
A yardarm .
I must take that chance , sir . But whatever happens , I 'll never blame you .
Thanks , lad , and I understand .
Good luck .
Well , this is goodbye , youngster .
We 'll never see each other again , that 's certain .
- But I 'll remember .
- l will too , Fletcher .
When you 're back in England with the fleet , you 'll hear the hue and cry against me .
From now on , they 'll spell mutiny with my name .
I regret that but not the taking of the ship .
Every time I think of Bligh ... .
Well , I 'd do it again . If ever I reach England again , I 'll go to your father and tell him the truth .
Thanks .
- l 'll be happier knowing that .
- Fletcher . What is out there for you ?
Another island .
- Stand by. I 'll be back in a moment .
- Hurry up , Byam . When she comes around the headland , we 're going to pilot her in .
Oh , Tehani , I 'll be back in two hours .
Tehani knows .
The ship may be here for months before she sails .
But she will sail .
Byam , midshipman .
Tehani knows . Tehani , you 're my wife , always .
Mrs. Roger Byam .
There she is , lads , and we 've nothing to fear .
We took no part in the mutiny .
Soon we 'll be in England .
Thank God !
We 're returning .
Good , eh ?
Very good , sir .
My name 's Byam , Roger Byam .
This is Mr. Stewart . We 're midshipmen of His Majesty 's ship , Bounty .
Bring those men up !
Captain Bligh , thank God you 're alive , sir .
They gave me a boat and a sail , didn 't they ?
Where is Fletcher Christian ? He sailed yesterday , sir , when your ship was sighted .
- Where to ?
- l don 't know , sir . - You don 't know , Stewart ?
- l don 't know either .
You 're lying , both of you .
Sergeant , put these men in irons .
- lrons ?
What for ? - Mutiny .
But we 're not mutineers . A court-martial in England will decide that .
- We 're as loyal as you .
- A court-martial will decide that !
We 're reporting for duty !
If we 're guilty , we 'd go with Christian . When Christian took my ship , you remained with him and you 'll have to answer for it .
It 'll be better to tell me where he 's gone !
We don 't know , sir .
Then you 'll lie in the hold until you do know .
By the mark , 1 2 !
Rocky bottom !
- To the lee helm .
- Lee helm , sir .
Steady !
Steady , sir . Mark 1 2 !
- Foretop , any sail in sight ?
- No sail , sir .
- Banktop !
- No sail , sir .
By the mark , 1 2 !
Mr. Byam , I can 't understand why he keeps us below here in irons .
You and Mr. Stewart , Mclntosh , Coleman , Byrne and myself we are no mutineers .
Haven 't I told him that time and time again ?
His marines surprised me and Muspratt , sir , or we wouldn 't be here , alive .
Reefs ahead !
Have you decided to tell me where Christian sailed for ?
By the mark , 1 2 !
Reefs ahead !
Well , stay here and rot .
My watch , I believe , Mr. Christian .
Very well , Mr. Young .
You heathen slime !
Enough !
I 'm sorry , sir .
Mr. Christian , sir , when are you going to make a landfall ?
We 're fierce sick of this . It 's more than man can stand to be at sea forever in a ghost ship .
I 've steered off the track of ships .
When it 's safe , I 'll put about for the island . Until then you 've got to trust me , that 's all .
Deep 1 1 .
Rocky bottom !
I beg you again to give up the search .
The Bounty must be lost . The ship 's dragging barnacles .
The seams are open .
Men are working the pumps day and night .
- We 're still afloat , are we not ?
- Only by the grace of God in these reefs .
- Ease her off a point .
- Ease her off a point , sir .
I must remind you this is one of His Majesty 's ships .
Mr. Edwards , I intend to bring back Fletcher Christian .
Unless he 's hanging from a yardarm , not one of His Majesty 's ships is safe .
Mutiny and piracy will be rampant in the fleet .
- But we 'll lose the ship .
- Then we 'll lose it !
As long as I have a deck under me , I 'll search for that man .
Fourteen !
To starboard !
Old Bligh 's a seaman .
The rocks are so thick , a fish couldn 't swim between them ... - ... without rubbing off his scales . - By the mark , 8 !
Let 's hope we 're moored before night or the sharks will have us .
By the mark , 2 !
Breakers ahead .
Hard alee !
What 's happened ?
- Hard to port !
- Very good , sir !
Haul out both of them !
Get the doors !
Captain Bligh !
Captain Bligh !
Get us out !
We 'll drown !
Lift with them and turn around !
Captain Bligh !
Let us out of here !
Save your voice , man !
Take charge of the aft boat .
Captain Bligh , get us out of here !
- Get those men out !
- Aye , aye , sir !
Come on , men !
Hurry up , soldier !
- The first boat 's ready .
- Take them out .
Make for the Australian coast .
Prisoners go with me in the other boat .
- Very good , sir .
God be with you .
- God be with you .
Hurry up with you down there .
Thank you .
You saved our lives .
Mr. Byam , I wouldn 't lose you for a flagship .
Get into the boat !
How long has this trial been going on ?
About a week now .
They should reach a verdict soon .
Oh , there , there , child .
But they won 't let me see him . Why won 't they let me see him ?
If I could see him to talk to him , he 'd know I trust him .
- He knows that , darling .
- Oh , but it 's cruel . Cruel .
They can 't hang him !
There 's the signal .
The trial is opened again .
On the 1 5th day of September , 1 792 for mutiny on His Majesty 's ship , Bounty .
Call Mr. Fryer .
Mr. Fryer .
Do you swear by God any evidence you give ... ?
Besides the leader , did you see any of the prisoners now before this court in arms ? - Yes , milord .
- lnform the court .
Seaman Burkitt and Seaman Muspratt were armed with muskets .
Seaman Ellison was armed with a bayonet .
Have any of the accused any questions to put to this witness ?
Yes , milord .
Good morning , Mr. Fryer .
Oh , good morning , lad .
Mr. Fryer , you say I was armed with a bayonet .
- Did you see me use it ? - By no means , lad .
Address your replies to the court .
Milord , he didn 't use the bayonet .
He merely flourished it under Captain Bligh 's nose and called him a few names . Names ?
What names did he call him ?
Sir , he- -
He called him a bluenosed baboon .
Have you any more questions to ask the witness ?
No , milord .
That is all .
Milord , I should like to ask a few questions of Captain Bligh .
Very well , Captain Nelson .
- Call Captain Bligh . - Captain Bligh .
Captain Bligh , in the previous evidence given before this court you failed to make clear one very important point .
A motive for the mutiny .
Can you tell us why your men took your ship ? No , sir .
Until I was seized in the cabin , I suspected nothing .
A circumstance occurred the night before which should have aroused my suspicions .
Going on deck , I found Fletcher Christian and Roger Byam talking together at the rail .
I heard Roger Byam say , " You can count on me . "
I heard Christian reply , " Good .
That 's settled . "
I saw them shake hands .
I realized afterwards they were plotting to seize the Bounty .
But that 's not true , Captain Bligh .
Milord , gentlemen , let me explain .
If the prisoner so desires , he may question the witness .
Captain Bligh , you 've not repeated my whole talk with Fletcher Christian .
Did you not hear him tell me about his home in Cumberland ?
I did not .
Well , did you not hear him ask my promise that if he did not return , I would tell his parents what had happened ?
I did not .
I swear before God and before this court that was the content of my talk with Christian .
It had nothing to do with mutiny .
Captain Bligh , apart from the conversation you overheard was Mr. Byam 's previous conduct such that you believe him guilty ?
Sir , his entire conduct convinces me that he plotted with Christian .
They were friends before the mutiny .
They remained friends after the mutiny .
When I arrived , the prisoner could 've arrested Christian .
But he allowed him to escape . On his own admittance .
Yes , but you knew I was trapped on the island , perhaps for years .
Outnumbered , unarmed .
I gave my word to Christian not to move against him .
Mr. Byam , if you were loyal when Christian escaped I should have found you dead .
I have nothing more to ask him .
I can only say again to this court , I am not guilty of mutiny .
If that is so , why did you not join your captain when he was cast adrift ?
I was below deck planning a counterattack to regain the ship from the mutineers .
With whom did you plan the attack ?
Sir , with my messmate , Midshipman Stewart .
Milord Midshipman Stewart died in the Pandora 's boat .
" The Lord is my shepherd .
I shall not want . "
The Lord is my shepherd .
I shall not want .
Can 't they ever reach a verdict ?
I 'm that sick of waiting , I could stamp on a litter of wildcats and never feel a scratch .
Well , what are you looking at ?
It ain 't Tahiti. lt 's only Portsmouth .
I thought she might row by in a boat .
Who , the queen ?
No , my wife .
Sorry , lad .
Why can 't I see her ?
My wife , my boy that 's all I 've come back for .
I knew they 'd hang me .
But I 've got to see them .
I 've got to see them !
Blast these sea captains !
Who made their sea law ? God didn 't .
The burning killers !
Lad !
We 're all in the same boat , Tom .
They won 't let me see my mother .
Won 't you help us now by holding on ?
Yes , sir .
Roger Byam ?
Follow me , please .
- Sir Joseph .
- My lad , they 've reached a verdict .
- Watch the dirk . - The dirk ?
The midshipman 's dirk will be lying on the table before Lord Hood .
If it lies crosswise , you 've been acquitted .
If the point lies toward you , you 've been condemned .
God be with you .
Thank you , sir .
Prisoner and escort , halt .
Left , hut .
Have you anything to say before the sentence of this court is passed upon you ?
Milord , much as I desire to live , I 'm not afraid to die .
Since I first sailed on the Bounty four years ago I 've known how men can be made to suffer worse things than death .
Cruelly , beyond duty , beyond necessity .
Captain Bligh , you 've told your story of mutiny on the Bounty .
How men plotted against you , seized your ship , cast you adrift in an open boat .
A great venture in science brought to nothing .
Two British ships lost .
But there 's another story , Captain Bligh of 1 0 coconuts and two cheeses .
A story of a man who robbed his seamen , cursed them , flogged them .
Not to punish , but to break their spirit .
A story of greed and tyranny and of anger against it , of what it cost .
One man , milord , would not endure such tyranny .
That 's why you hounded him . That 's why you hate him , hate his friends .
And that 's why you 're beaten .
Fletcher Christian 's still free .
But Christian lost too , milord .
God knows he 's judged himself more harshly than you could judge him .
I say to his father , he was my friend .
No finer man ever lived .
I don 't try to justify his crime , his mutiny but I condemn the tyranny that drove him to it .
I don 't speak here for myself alone , but for these men you 've condemned .
I speak in their names and Fletcher Christian 's name for all men at sea .
These men don 't ask for comfort .
They don 't ask for safety .
If they could speak to you , they 'd say :
" Let us choose to do our duty willingly .
Not the choice of a slave , but that of free Englishmen . "
They ask only the freedom that England expects for every man .
If one man among you believed that- - One man .
He could command the fleets of England .
He could sweep the seas for England .
If he called his men to their duty not by flaying their backs but by lifting their hearts their ... .
That 's all .
Roger Byam , midshipman .
Having heard the evidence against you and having heard your own defense the sentence of this court is you shall suffer death by hanging onboard such of His Majesty 's ships of war and at such time as the commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of Great Britain and Ireland shall direct .
Prisoner and escort , into file .
Left , turn .
Quick , hut .
I pronounce this court dissolved .
Milord , may I congratulate the court ?
Captain Bligh , in my opinion , your open-boat voyage was the most remarkable conduct of navigation in the history of the sea .
I must admire your seamanship and courage , but ... .
Detachment , fall in .
Thanks , mate .
I 've seen them , sir , thanks to you and your friends .
The wife , she 's well , sir .
And the boy , blow me , I hardly knew him , he 's growed so .
You wouldn 't believe it , the dead spit of me .
I 'm glad , Tom .
Look , sir .
Like the one she gave me the day we sailed for Tahiti .
Do you know , sir , that sailing seems like a dream .
As far away as the islands are .
I remember how Mr. Christian talked to me that day .
Cheered me up , he did .
Where do you think he is now , sir ?
I 'd give anything to know .
One thing 's certain , he 's taken that ship beyond maps .
I wonder if he found his island .
- Well , sir , what did you find ?
- Your new home , lads .
There she is , Pitcairn 's Island .
- There 's no anchorage , no place to land .
- That 's why I chose it .
I plan to run the Bounty in head-on , salvage what we can , then burn her .
- We 'd be fools to burn her .
- We 'll be fools if we don 't .
If there 's one spar left in sight , we 'll never be safe .
- We can 't burn the ship .
- We can never get back .
There 's no way back , lad .
Once ashore , we 're there to stay .
But this ship 's our last tie with home .
Yon 's a lonely rock to die on .
It 's enough to live on .
There 's sun and earth and water .
It can be a hell or a home as we choose to make it .
We 'll remember this as long as we live and regret it .
And remember why we took this ship .
They can 't press-gang you there , they can 't starve you , and they can 't flog you .
We 're not afraid of a new life .
As long as we can live it with decency and self-respect , we can and we must .
For ourselves and our children .
Well , hands for burning ?
- l say burn her , hull and sticks .
- Aye , aye .
Very well . We 'll get the women and children ashore and then stand by to take her in .
She makes a grand light , sir .
Good English oak .
Discipline has been maintained .
The mutineers who confessed have been punished .
But we 're here to plead for the life of Roger Byam because we believe him innocent .
And there is more at stake here , Your Majesty , than his life .
We do not exaggerate when we say a new understanding between officers and men has come to the fleet .
By returning Byam to duty , Your Majesty will confirm that understanding .
And not for today only , but for all time to come .
Everyone aboard ?
- The last shore boat 's coming alongside .
- Make ready for sea .
Very good , sir .
- Ship ready for sea , sir .
- Very good .
- Midshipman Byam , reporting for duty .
- You take the mizzenmast , Byam .
- Very glad to have you with us , lad .
- Thank you , sir .
- May I , Byam ?
- Of course .
We 're off to the Mediterranean , lad .
- The gentleman has not arrived ?
- No , he has not .
I 'm afraid the dinner will be spoiled .
What difference does it make ?
It 's too late to dine now .
Boy , will you page Mr. Otis B. Driftwood , please ?
Paging Mr. Driftwood !
Mr. Driftwood !
Do me a favor and stop yelling my name all over this restaurant .
- Do I go around yelling your name ?
- Mr. Driftwood !
Is your voice changing , or is somebody else paging me ?
- Mr. Driftwood !
- Why , Mrs. Claypool , hello !
You invited me to dine with you at 7 : 00 .
It is now 8 : 00 , and no dinner .
No dinner ?
I just had one of the biggest meals of my life ... and no thanks to you , either .
- I 've been sitting right here since 7 : 00 .
- With your back to me .
When I dine with a woman , I expect her to look at my face .
- That 's the price she has to pay .
- Your check , sir .
$ 9.40 ?
This is an outrage !
If I were you , I wouldn 't pay it .
- What are we gonna have for dinner ?
- You 've had your dinner .
All right , we 'll have breakfast .
- Waiter !
- Yes , sir .
- Have you got any milk-fed chicken ?
- Yes , sir .
Squeeze the milk out of one and bring me a glass .
Yes , sir .
Mr. Driftwood , three months ago , you promised to put me into society .
In all that time , you 've done nothing but draw a very handsome salary .
You think that 's nothing ?
How many men do you think draw a handsome salary ?
You can count them on the fingers of one hand , my good woman .
- I 'm not your good woman !
- Don 't say that , Mrs. Claypool .
I don 't care what your past has been .
To me , you 'll always be my good woman , because I love you .
There .
I didn 't mean to tell you but you dragged it out of me .
I love you .
That 's hard to believe when I find you dining with another woman .
That woman ?
Do you know why I sat with her ?
Because she reminded me of you .
- Really ?
- Of course .
That 's why I 'm here with you , because you remind me of you .
Your eyes , your throat , your lips ...
Everything about you reminds me of you ... except you .
How do you account for that ?
She figures that out , she 's good .
Mr. Driftwood , I think we 'd better keep everything on a business basis .
Every time I get romantic with you , you want to talk business .
I don 't know .
There 's something about me that brings out the business in all women .
All right , we 'll talk business .
You see that man eating spaghetti ?
- No .
- You see the spaghetti , don 't you ?
Behind that spaghetti is none other than Herman Gottlieb ... director of the New York Opera Company .
- Do you follow me ?
- Yes .
Stop following me , or I 'll have you arrested !
I 've arranged for you to invest $ 200,000 in the New York Opera Company .
I don 't understand .
Don 't you see ?
You 'll be a patron of the opera .
You 'll get into society .
You can marry me , and they 'll kick you out of society ... and all you 've lost is $ 200,000 .
Gottlieb .
Allow me .
Mrs. Claypool , Mr. Gottlieb .
I could go on all night , but it 's tough on my suspenders .
Where was I ?
What are you doing ?
If you four people want to play bridge , don 't mind me , go right ahead .
Mrs. Claypool , I 'm so happy .
I just wanted to see if your rings were still there .
You 're as charming as you are beautiful .
I 'm afraid you 've used that speech before , Mr. Gottlieb .
Now listen here , Gottlieb , making love to Mrs. Claypool is my racket .
What you 're after is $ 200,000 .
Make it sound plausible , because incredible as it may seem ...
Mrs. Claypool isn 't as big a sap as she looks .
How 's that for lovemaking ?
I think the Europeans do it better .
All right , Gottlieb , it 's your turn .
You take a whack at her ... and keep it clean .
Mrs. Claypool , it is most generous of you to help us .
Now , you have , of course , heard of Rodolfo Lassparri .
- Of course .
- He is the greatest tenor since Caruso .
Tonight , with the money you so generously provide ... I sign Lassparri for the Opera Company .
He will be a sensation .
All New York will be at your feet .
There 's plenty of room .
And now , the opera awaits us .
If you both will honor me by occupying my box .
I should be charmed .
- And you , Mr. Driftwood ?
- I 'll join up with you later .
Listen , Gottlieb , nix on the lovemaking , because I saw Mrs. Claypool first .
Of course , her mother really saw her first , but why bring the civil War into this ?
What are you doing in my costume ?
Take it off at once , do you hear ?
Lmmediately .
Why , you ...
Take that off .
Take off that dress , do you hear me ?
You dumb idiot .
You do what I say , or I 'll break your neck !
Do you hear me ?
Take off that dress .
If I get my hands on you , you 'll never hear the end of this !
You 're no longer my dresser , you 're fired !
Get out !
Get out , do you hear me ?
Out you go .
And don 't come back in here again .
Don 't you care .
You 're lucky to be rid of him .
- Good evening , Rosa .
- Good evening , slgnore .
Tomasso , why don 't you come in ?
I 've been waiting for you .
Are they not beautiful , slgnorlna ?
From Slgnor Lassparri .
I wouldn 't wear them if they were the only flowers in the world .
- Come in !
- Not if you use that tone .
Let 's try the whole thing all over again .
Only this time , try to be more cordial .
- Come in .
- That 's better .
Let 's try it once more .
No , Ricky .
You 're such a fool .
- What was it you wanted to see me about ?
- I suppose I sent for you ?
You meant to .
Didn 't she , Marie ?
It 's the last night of the season , and I 'm more in love with you than ever .
- What will you do about it ?
- We have all summer to talk that over .
- Tonight , we have to sing an opera .
- You have to sing an opera .
- I 'm nothing but a glorified chorus man .
- Don 't say that .
I 've got to say it .
I 've got something else to say .
What are you doing tonight , unless that ham Lassparri asked you first .
- He has asked me first .
- Just my luck .
But I 'm having supper with you , Riccardo .
Hooray !
We 'll have champagne , music , flowers ...
" Lassparri . "
No flowers .
- Fiorello !
- Tony !
- Where have you been all these weeks ?
- Here , there , different places .
- Got some mail for me ?
- mail for you ?
You don 't work here .
Where am I gonna get my mail ?
I no work anyplace .
Tomasso !
Not so good .
Don 't be so glad .
I brought you present .
You got something for me , too ?
What do you got ?
Where 's Riccardo ?
All right .
What are you doing here ?
I thought you were with the circus .
The circus ?
When was I with the circus ?
I nearly forgot .
That was a long time ago , last week .
Since then I have lots ofjobs .
Your piano and my voice .
All those years we studied at the conservatory , and what 's come of it ?
What 's a matter with you ?
We 're still young .
We 've got our health .
You hear that ?
Someday , Riccardo , you 're gonna be where Lassparri is .
When you were six years old , you sing better than Lassparri .
Maybe I was better at six than I am now .
You make me sick .
You crazy .
You sing better than he ever could sing and you know it .
I know it and you know it , but the public doesn 't know it .
- All right .
We tell the public .
- How ?
What you need is a manager .
A wise guy , somebody who 's very smart .
- I knowjust the man for you .
- You do ?
Who is it ?
Me !
- But you wouldn 't make any money at it .
- I 'll break even .
Just as long as I no lose nothing .
- Is the opera over yet ?
- Not yet , slgnore , in a few minutes .
I told you to slow that nag down .
On account of you , I nearly heard the opera .
Once around the park , and drive slowly .
And none of your back talk .
You 're still crazy about her ?
And she 's crazy about you , too ?
Even if she was , I couldn 't ask her to marry me .
Don 't worry .
The manager , he 'll fix everything .
Anyhow , we 're together again ...
- you and me , just like old times .
- Yeah , like old times .
Yeah , you bet my life .
If you pardon my saying so , Mrs. Claypool ... Mr. Driftwood seems hardly the person to handle your business affairs .
- I 'm beginning to think the same thing .
- Bravo !
I made it .
How soon does the curtain go up ?
The curtain , Mr. Driftwood , will go up again next season .
- You 've missed the entire opera .
- I only missed it by a few minutes .
I can go then ?
Was I right ?
Isn 't Lassparri the greatest tenor that ever lived ?
He 's superb .
But what would you have to pay him ?
What 's the difference ?
He must sail with us tomorrow no matter what we pay .
- He would be worth $ 1,000 a night .
- How much ?
- What does he do ?
- What does he do , he sings .
You 're willing to pay him $ 1,000 a night just for singing ?
You can get a phonograph record of Minnie the Moocher for 75 cents .
For $ 1.25 , you can get Minnie .
If you 'll excuse me , Mrs. Claypool ... I think I had better arrange to see Lassparri immediately .
- You are agreed , $ 1,000 a night ?
- Just as you think .
$ 1,000 .
There must be some way I can get a piece of this .
Wait .
Why don 't I sign Lassparri ?
I represent Mrs. Claypool .
But I represent the New York Opera Company .
Boy ?
Will you give my card to Slgnor Lassparri , please ?
What is it ?
What do you want ?
- Rosa .
- Yes , slgnore ?
My good friend Herman Gottlieb is coming back to see me .
How would you like to have supper with us ?
I 'm terribly sorry , Slgnor Lassparri , I already have an engagement .
I see .
That 's too bad , because I have an idea ... he 's going to invite me to sing in New York .
And he may permit me to select my leading lady .
Are you sure you can 't break your appointment ?
I 'm terribly sorry , slgnore .
What do you mean by humiliating me in front of those people ?
You 're fired , do you understand ?
You big bully , why are you hitting that little bully ?
Will you kindly let me handle my own affairs ?
Get out .
What do you got to say to me ?
Can you sleep on your stomach with such big buttons on your pajamas ?
Why , you ...
Nice work , I think you got him .
Smelling salts .
That will bring him to .
You 're sorry for what you did ?
That shows a nice spirit .
Now he 's coming along .
He 'll be fine now .
- Get fresh with me , huh ? - How do you do ?
- Hello .
- What 's the matter , mister ?
We had an argument .
He pulled a knife on me , so I shot him .
- Do you mind if I ...
- Go right ahead .
Plenty of room .
- Two beers , bartender .
- I 'll take two beers , too .
Things seem to be getting better around the country .
I don 't know .
I 'm a stranger here myself .
I came back here looking for somebody .
You don 't know who it is , do you ?
It 's a funny thing , it just slipped my mind .
I know .
The greatest tenor in the world .
That 's what I 'm after .
- Why , I 'm his manager .
- Whose manager ?
The greatest tenor in the world .
- The fellow that sings at the opera here ?
- Sure .
What 's his name ?
What do you care ?
I can 't pronounce it .
What do you want with him ?
I want to sign him up for the New York Opera Company .
Do you know that America is waiting to hear him sing ?
He can sing loud but he can 't sing that loud .
I think I can get America to meet him halfway .
Could he saiI tomorrow ?
You pay him enough money , he could sail yesterday .
How much you pay him ?
I don 't know .
Let 's see , $ 1,000 a night .
I 'm entitled to a small profit .
- How about $ 10 a night ?
- $ 10 ?
I 'll take it .
All right , but remember , I get 10 % for negotiating the deal .
Yes , and I get 10 % for being the manager .
How much does that leave ?
Well , that leaves him $ 8 .
- He sends $ 5 home to his mother .
- That leaves $ 3 .
Can he live in New York on $ 3 ?
Like a prince .
Of course , he won 't be able to eat , but he can live like a prince .
However , out of that $ 3, he 'll have to pay an income tax .
Yes , there 's a federal tax , a state tax , and a city tax ... a street tax , and a sewer tax .
How much does this come to ?
I figure if he doesn 't sing too often , he can break even .
- All right , we take it .
- All right , fine .
Here are the contracts .
You just put his name at the top , and you sign at the bottom .
No need of you reading that because these are duplicates .
Yeah .
Is a duplicate .
- Duplicates ?
- I say , they 're duplicates .
- Don 't you know what duplicates are ?
- Sure , those five kids up in Canada .
I wouldn 't know about that .
I haven 't been in Canada in years .
Go ahead and read it .
- What does it say ?
- Go on and read it .
- You read it .
- All right , I 'll read it to you .
- Can you hear ?
- I haven 't heard anything yet .
- You say anything ?
- I haven 't said anything worth hearing .
That 's why I didn 't hear anything .
That 's why I didn 't say anything .
- Can you read ?
- I can read , but I can 't see it .
Don 't seem to have it in focus here .
If my arms were a little longer , I could read it .
You haven 't got a baboon in your pocket , have you ?
Here we are . Now I 've got it .
Pay particular attention to this first clause because it 's most important .
It says , " The party of the first part shall be known in this contract ...
" as the party of the first part . "
How do you like that ?
That 's pretty neat , eh ?
No , it 's no good .
- What 's the matter with it ?
- I don 't know . Let 's hear it again .
" The party of the first part shall be known in this contract ...
" as the party of the first part . "
Sounds a little better this time .
It grows on you .
Would you like to hear it once more ?
Just the first part .
What ? " The party of the first part " ?
No .
The first part of " the party of the first part . "
It says , " The first part of the party of the first part ...
" shall be known in this contract as the first part of the party ...
" Shall be known in this contract ... "
Why should we quarrel about this ?
We 'll take it out .
Yeah .
It 's too long anyhow .
Now what do we got left ?
I got about a foot and a half .
It says , " The party of the second part shall be known in this contract ...
" as the party of the second part . "
I don 't know about that .
- Now what 's the matter ?
- I don 't like the second party either .
You should have come to the first party .
We didn 't get home till around 4 : 00 a.m.
I was blind for three days .
Why can 't the first part of the second party ... be the second part of the first party ?
Then you got something .
Look , rather than go through that again , what do you say ...
Fine .
I 've got something you 're bound to like .
You 'll be crazy about it .
No . I don 't like it .
- You don 't like what ?
- Whatever it is , I don 't like it .
Don 't let 's break up an old friendship over a thing like that .
Ready ?
Okay .
The next part , I don 't think you 're going to like .
Your word 's good enough for me .
Is my word good enough for you ?
- I should say not .
- That takes out two more clauses .
- " The party of the eighth part ... "
- No , that 's no good .
- " The party of the ninth ... " - No , that 's no good , too .
How is it my contract is skinnier than yours ?
I don 't know , you must have been out on a tear last night .
- We 're all set now , aren 't we ?
- Sure .
Just you put your name down there , and then the deal is legal .
I forgot to tell you , I can 't write .
That 's all right , there 's no ink in the pen .
- But it 's a contract , isn 't it ?
- Sure .
We 've got a contract , no matter how small it is .
Wait .
What does this say here ?
That ?
That 's the usual clause . That 's in every contract .
That just says , " If any of the parties ...
" participating in this contract ...
" are shown not to be in their right mind ...
" the entire agreement is automatically nullified . "
I don 't know .
It 's all right .
That 's in every contract .
That 's what they call a sanity clause .
You can 't fool me .
There ain 't no Sanity Claus .
You win the white carnation .
- I 'll give this to Riccardo .
... sensation in New York .
Could you tell me where Slgnor Lassparri is ?
Sure .
There 's Lassparri .
Lassparri ?
Then whom did I sign ?
You signed Riccardo Baroni .
That 's my man .
Slgnor Lassparri , what happened ?
Speak to me .
It 's me , it 's Gottlieb .
What is this now ?
How early the fruit is falling this season .
- Are you sure you have everything , Otis ?
- I 've never had any complaints yet .
Here you are , on your way to America and fame .
Riccardo , I 'm going to miss you .
How do you think I feel about it ?
Miss Castaldi , ready for the big trip ?
Mr. Gottlieb . This is Riccardo Baroni of the Opera Company .
- How do you do ?
- Did you say Baroni ?
Is it as funny as all that ?
Mr. Otis B. Driftwood seems to think you have quite a voice .
He has , Mr. Gottlieb , really he has , a wonderful voice .
- Yes , really I have .
- That 's interesting .
- Come on , Riccardo .
- No , thanks .
Come on , Ricky !
- Slgnor Lassparri .
- Yes ?
- Will you give us a farewell song ?
- Please !
Come on !
My dear friends , I am so sorry , I must be excused ... but I have a slight touch of laryngitis .
- Where 's Rosa ?
- Yes , Rosa !
Why should I sing for them when I 'm not being paid for it ?
- Please sing .
- No .
Yes , of course I 'll sing .
Mr. Gottlieb .
Hasn 't he a wonderful voice ?
There must be a place for him in New York .
Not a bad voice .
Someday , perhaps , when he has made a reputation .
All visitors ashore !
Rosa !
We 've come to say goodbye .
All right .
Goodbye . Arrlvedercl .
Come on !
- All right , take it away .
- Yes , sir .
Have I got time to go back and pay my hotel bill ?
- Sorry . Too late .
- That suits me fine .
That 's mine .
A trunk thief ?
- Where you going with that ?
- Suite number 58 , sir .
Fifty-eight ?
That 's me .
Let 's go .
What 's the idea ?
Hit-and-run driver ?
I 'm sorry , sir .
Sorry , my eye .
Look at that fender .
It 's all bumped out of shape .
You 'll pay for this , my good man .
Let me see your number .
Thirty-two ?
You got any insurance ?
- What ?
- Are you insured ?
- No , sir .
- You 're just the fellow I want to see .
I have an accident policy that protects you no matter what happens .
If you lose a leg , we 'll look for it .
All this will cost you is ...
What have you got there ?
$ 1 . Here you are .
Let 's go .
Suite 58, and don 't go over 20 miles an hour .
Say , was that three fellows or one fellow with three beards ?
Hi , Gottlieb , always beating around the bush .
Wait a minute .
Anything I can do ?
- Just a little homesick .
- That 's funny .
I happen to have the greatest prescription for homesickness you ever saw .
A fellow gave it to me just before the boat sailed .
Here 's the prescription , and take it every two hours .
I 'm going out and getting another prescription .
- Hello , toots .
- Hello .
- Say , pretty classy layout you got here .
- Do you like it ?
Twin beds .
You little rascal , you .
- One of those is a day bed .
- A likely story .
Have you read any good books lately ?
Mr. Driftwood , will you please get off the bed ?
- What would people say ?
- They 'd say you 're a very lucky woman .
Will you please shut up so I can continue reading ?
No , I will not shut up .
And will you kindly get up at once ?
All right , I 'll go .
I 'll make you another proposition .
Let 's go in my room and discuss the situation .
- What situation ?
- What situations have you got ?
- I most certainly will not go to your room .
- Okay . Then I 'll stay here .
All right .
I 'll come , but get out .
Shall we say 10 minutes ?
Yes , 10 minutes .
Anything , but go .
Because if you 're not there in 10 minutes , I 'll be back here in 11 .
With squeaky shoes on .
- Wait a minute .
This can 't be my room .
- Yes , sir .
Suite number 58 , sir .
Fifty-eight ?
That 's an awful big number for a birdcage this size .
Wouldn 't it be simpler if you just put the stateroom in the trunk ?
Say , who is responsible for installing me in this telephone booth ?
Mr. Gottlieb picked it out for you , sir .
Gottlieb ?
That 's awfully decent of him .
Awfully decent .
Did he pick out the whole room orjust the porthole ?
- I 'm sure you 'll find it cozy , sir .
- Cozy is hardly the word .
Anything else , sir ?
Yes .
Tomorrow you can take the trunk out and I 'll go in .
Yes , sir .
- Hello , boss .
What are you doing here ?
- Hello .
This makes it a perfect voyage .
- I 'm sorry .
I thought this was my trunk .
- It is your trunk .
I don 't remember packing you boys .
Remember Riccardo Baroni , the greatest tenor in the world ?
You nearly signed him up once .
Sure .
I just delivered a letter for you .
How are you ?
- Good . Just a little cramped .
- We 're still in the harbor .
As soon as we get out in the ocean , there 'll be plenty of room .
- Isn 't that my shirt ?
- I don 't know .
I found it in the trunk .
Then it couldn 't be mine .
It 's nice seeing you again .
But I was expecting my other suit .
Did you see it ?
Yeah .
Took up too much room , so we sold it .
- Did you get anything for it ?
That 's my suit , all right .
Say , it 's lucky I left another shirt in this drawer .
That can 't be my shirt . My shirt doesn 't snore .
Don 't wake him up .
He 's got insomnia .
He 's sleeping it off .
That 's as grisly a looking object as I 've ever seen .
Get him up out of there .
He certainly is sleeping .
I wish you fellows would explain this thing to me .
It 's very simple .
You see , Riccardo , he 's in love with Rosa .
Rosa , she go to New York .
We want to go to New York , too .
But we got no money , so we hide in the trunk .
Without money , what 'll you do in New York ?
I can sing .
There must be some place for me to work .
Besides , I can be near Rosa .
That 's the main thing .
You won 't give us away , will you ?
No , but you fellows have got to get out of here .
I 've got a date with a lady in a few minutes ... and you know the old saying :
" Two 's company , five 's a crowd . "
We go , but we want something to eat .
We no eat all day .
We 're hungry .
We 'll discuss the food situation later .
We get food , or we don 't go .
I know I never should have met you fellows .
Okay .
But promise to scram out after you 've eaten .
- All right .
- I 'll get the steward .
You fellows be quiet .
Remember , you 're stowaways .
- We no say nothing .
- All right .
Now , just put that bag of Jell-O over here .
Wouldn 't it be simpler if you had him stuffed ?
- He 's no olive .
- I 'll go and get the steward .
Is it the door of the room , or am I in the trunk ?
Over here .
Be quiet , now .
Don 't make any noise .
- We no say nothing .
- I 'll get the steward .
Steward !
- Stew !
- Yes , sir .
- I say , stew ...
- Yes , sir .
- What 's for dinner ?
- Anything you like .
Tomatojuice , orange juice , grape juice , pineapple juice ...
Turn off the juice before I get electrocuted .
All right , let me have one of each .
And two fried eggs , two poached eggs ... two scrambled eggs , and two medium-boiled eggs .
And two hard-boiled eggs .
And two hard-boiled eggs .
Make that three hard-boiled eggs .
And some roast beef : Rare , medium , well-done , and overdone .
And two hard-boiled eggs .
Make that three hard-boiled eggs .
And eight pieces of French pastry .
- With two hard-boiled eggs .
- And two hard-boiled eggs .
Make that three hard-boiled eggs .
And one duck egg .
- Have you got any stewed prunes ?
- Yes , sir .
Give them some black coffee .
That 'll sober them up .
And two hard-boiled eggs .
It 's either foggy out , or make that 12 more hard-boiled eggs .
Rush that along .
The faster it comes , the faster this convention will be over .
Yes , sir .
- Do they allow tipping on the boat ?
- Yes , sir !
- Have you got two fives ?
- Yes , sir .
Then you won 't need the 10 cents I was gonna give you .
That 's fine .
If that steward is deaf and dumb ...
- he 'll never know you 're in here .
- That 's all right .
- Yes ?
- We 've come to make up your room .
- Are those my hard-boiled eggs ?
- I can 't tell until they get in the room .
Come in , girls .
Leave all hope behind .
Work fast because you gotta get out in 10 minutes .
Tomasso .
Wake up .
They 're going to fix the bed .
I 'd like two pillows on that bed there .
There 's a slight misunderstanding here .
I said the girls had to work fast , not your friend .
He 's still asleep .
You know , he does better asleep than I do awake .
Yeah , he always sleeps that way .
- Now he 's half-asleep .
- Yes , he 's half-asleep in a half Nelson .
- All right , come on .
- Yes ?
I 'm the engineer .
I 'm here to turn off the heat .
You can start right in on him .
Wake up , Tomasso .
Tomasso , we 're going to eat soon .
You know , if it wasn 't for Gottlieb , I wouldn 't have got this room .
Just hold him there a second .
- Yes ?
- Did you want a manicure ?
No . Come on in .
I hadn 't planned on a manicure , but on ajourney like this ... you ought to have every convenience you can get .
Listen , I 'm getting the manicure .
Get out of here , will you ?
Did you want your nails long or short ?
You better make them short .
It 's getting kind of crowded in here .
I don 't know .
This isn 't the way I pictured an ocean voyage .
I always visualized myself in a steamer chair with a steward bringing me bouillon .
Come on , Riccardo .
You couldn 't get bouillon in unless they brought it in through a keyhole .
I 'm the engineer 's assistant .
I had a premonition you were going to show up .
The engineer 's over there in the corner .
You can chop your way right through .
Is it my imagination , or is it getting crowded in here ?
I got plenty of room .
- Yes ?
- Is my Aunt Minnie in here ?
You can come in and prowl around if you want to .
If she isn 't in here , you can probably find somebody just as good .
- Could I use your phone ?
- Use the phone ?
- I 'll lay you even money you can 't get in .
- How do you do ?
This boat will be in New York before you get to that phone .
I came to mop up .
Just the woman I 'm looking for .
Come right ahead .
You have to start on the ceiling .
It 's the only place that 's not occupied .
- You can clean my shoes if you want to .
- Operator .
Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room , will you ?
- Steward .
- Come right ahead .
- The food !
- We 've been waiting all afternoon for you .
I want my Aunt Minnie !
Ladies and gentlemen ... it 's with great pleasure I welcome you all on this , the final night of the voyage .
I cannot let the evening pass ... without paying a little tribute to our distinguished guests of honor :
The three greatest aviators in the world .
Three greatest aviators , but notice they 're traveling by boat .
We are honored by your presence , gentlemen .
- Thank you .
- Thank you , Captain .
- Do you rumba ? - Why , yes .
Of course I do .
Take a rumba from one to ten .
Mr. Claypool went to his reward three years ago .
- And left you all alone .
- All alone .
With $ 8 million .
$ 8 million .
Gottlieb , you 're just wasting your time .
If Mrs. Claypool wants to marry a fortune hunter , she 's got me .
Fortune hunter ?
In fact , you can 't call me a fortune hunter .
Because when I proposed to her , I thought she only had $ 7 million .
But the extra million never interfered with my feelings for her .
If you had any real feeling for me ... you 'd stop associating with the riffraff I 've seen you with .
You mean Gottlieb ?
I mean those two uncouth men I saw you around the opera house with .
I 'm grateful they 're not on board the boat .
- Why , have they slipped off ?
- Sit down .
Come on , we find something to eat .
You think it 's safe ?
If they catch us , they 'll deport us .
What will we lose ?
If we 're deported , they 'll feed us .
Come on , we 'll take a chance .
Does it mean nothing to you that I 'm the world 's greatest singer ?
- But I love to hear you sing , Rodolfo .
- No .
Let me put it this way .
I love you .
I adore you .
I would die for you .
- Now do you understand ?
- I 'm afraid I don 't .
The whole thing is very simple .
When he says he 's the greatest singer , it means he loves you .
Personally , I don 't believe either statement .
There may be something in what you say .
I 'll tell you something confidentially .
The only tenor I could ever stand was a fellow by the name ... of Riccardo Baroni .
- Ever hear of him ?
- Riccardo .
I wonder where he is right now .
Probably roaming over the countryside someplace .
Riccardo always loved the open .
He never could stand being cooped up .
He still doesn 't like it .
Tomasso , you feel better now ?
And , you , Riccardo , how do you feel ?
After a meal like that ?
Great . I could sing my head off .
That 's the spirit .
Stop that !
Get away from those instruments !
- What are you doing here ?
- Please let him play .
Let him play .
It 's all right with me .
Let him play .
Those men can 't be passengers on this boat .
- They must be stowaways .
- Stowaways ? We 'll soon find out .
What are you ...
Are you crazy ?
You got it .
Fine .
Now you go first and see if it 's safe .
Come on . Hold on .
Out you go .
You 're all right , but the boat 's too far away .
What 's he doing now ?
I think he 's hanging himself .
- Gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to ...
- Quiet .
Our guests have asked me to represent them and to act as their interpreter .
If you 'll follow me , I 'll take you to their cabin .
If they 're still in it , very few of us will come out alive .
Pardon me .
Our guests are having their shredded wheat .
They 'll be right out .
Gentlemen .
- " Kind friends ... " - Give me that .
Let 's cut this short .
The whole thing is very simple .
You 're going to City Hall .
The Mayor 's gonna make another speech .
We can tear up the Mayor 's speech when we get there .
So , my friends , as mayor of this great city ... I take pleasure in inviting our distinguished visitors ... to tell us something about their achievement .
What 'll I say ?
- Tell them you 're not here .
- Suppose they don 't believe me ?
They 'll believe you when you start talking .
Friends ...
Talk fast .
I see a man in the crowd with a rope .
How we happen to come to America is a great story , but I no tell that .
When we first started out ... we got no idea you give us this grand reception .
We don 't deserve it .
When I say we don 't deserve it ... believe me , I know what I 'm talking about .
That 's a novelty .
Now I tell you how we fly to America .
The first time , we get halfway across when we run out of gasoline .
We got to go back .
Then I take twice as much gasoline .
This time , we were just about to land , maybe 3 feet ... when , what do you think , we run out of gasoline again .
Back we go and get more gas .
This time , I take plenty gas .
We get halfway over , when what do you think happened ?
We forgot the airplane .
So we sit down and talk it over .
Then I get the great idea ... we no take gasoline .
We no take the airplane .
We take steamship .
And that , friends , is how we fly across the ocean .
I 'm going out to arrange your ball .
This is the mayor again .
And now I take great pleasure in introducing another of our heroes ... who will tell you something of his exploits .
Of course .
From now on , it 's every man for himself .
I would suggest you make your speech a little more direct than your brother 's .
What will you give me to set fire to your beard ?
We 're all right as long as the water supply holds out .
Please , the radio .
Your speech .
They may have to build a dam in the back of him .
I think these fellas are phonies .
- What 's that you say ?
- You heard me .
You hear what they say ?
They 've never been so insulted , and they refuse to stay .
No , please .
Tell them he didn 't mean it .
Of course , you know this means war .
Now see what you 've done .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm awful sorry .
I apologize , and I hope you 're not offended .
Go on !
After him !
Come on , get him .
What are you singing about ?
Read this .
What will you do ?
First , I 'll throw those two gorillas out .
That goes for you , too .
Thought I got rid of those mugs when I sold my trunk .
Kiddies , come on , everything is piping hot .
Breakfast .
- Good morning .
- Oh , boy , I 'm hungry .
Read that .
That will take away your appetite .
No .
That only makes me hungrier .
Come on .
You 're going to be late forjaiI .
Those certainly went like hot cakes .
You know , this isn 't the way I anticipated my breakfast .
I 'm certainly getting enough of you fellas .
- I no like cupcakes .
- No .
I know when I 've had enough ...
Say , wait a minute .
That was a two-bit cigar .
Bad enough I have to smoke those things without eating them .
Get out .
Glad I didn 't bring my vest .
I forgot to tell you .
He ate your vest last night for dessert .
He 's half goat .
Yes , and that 's giving him all the best of it .
Thought I had another cigar on me .
He 's going to smell like a vegetable salad when he gets through with that .
I 've been looking forward to this breakfast .
I 've been waiting all morning .
This is how it wound up .
- I 'll take a quart .
- A little of that , anyway .
Why don 't you fellows be nice ?
Get out of here before I get arrested .
I 'd like to stay and see that .
What 's that ?
If it 's a policeman , knock once more .
- That 's good enough for me .
- Scram , get out .
Come in .
- Yes ?
- You remember me .
I 'm Henderson , plainclothesman .
You look more like an old clothes man to me .
- Nice place .
- It 's comfortable .
You live here all alone ?
Yes .
Just me and my memories .
- I 'm practically a hermit .
- A hermit .
I notice the table is set for four .
That 's nothing . My alarm clock is set for 8 : 00 .
That doesn 't prove a thing .
A wise guy .
I 'll take a little look around .
- Hey , you .
- Coming .
What 's a hermit doing with four beds ?
- You see those first three beds ?
- Yes .
Last night , I counted 5,000 sheep on those beds .
So I had to have another bed .
You wouldn 't want me to sleep with the sheep , would you ?
- Who are you talking to ?
- I was talking to myself .
There 's nothing you can do about it .
- I 've had three of the best doctors .
- I certainly heard somebody talk .
- Sheer folly on your part .
- What 's this ?
That 's a fire escape .
That 's a table . This is a room .
There 's the door leading out .
I wish you would use it .
- I want to be alone .
- You 'll be alone when I throw you in jail .
Isn 't there a song like that , Henderson ?
Look out .
He 's coming around the other way .
Get inside , quick .
It means a stretch at the big house if he catches you .
Don 't let him catch you .
- Hey , you !
- Coming .
What became of that fourth bed ?
What are you referring to , Colonel ?
Last time I was in this room , there were four beds here .
Please .
I 'm not interested in your private life , Henderson .
Say , what 's that bed doing here ?
I don 't see it doing anything .
There 's something funny going on here .
But I 'll get to the bottom of it .
Stairs right there .
Look out !
- Be on your guard .
- Hey , you !
Coming .
Am I crazy , or are there only two beds here ?
Which question do you want me to answer first ?
How did those two beds get together ?
You know how those things are .
They breed like rabbits .
Let me tell you something .
I 'll solve this if I have to stay here all night .
- Lf you stay , you 'll have to bring a bed .
- One bed !
One bed ?
What are you talking about ?
Now they 're all gone .
I know I am crazy .
I beg your pardon , I must be in the wrong room .
You thought you could come to America without me ?
You fool . You dear fool .
Because I love you , you call me a fool .
There may be something in that .
- What are you doing here ?
- Easiest thing in the world .
An open window , a detective , and here I am .
Riccardo , you shouldn 't have .
They 'll only send you back again .
- Perhaps even put you in jail .
- I don 't care , darling .
It 's worth it .
Suppose I go to Mr. Gottlieb .
Maybe he 'd intercede for you .
Gottlieb couldn 't do anything .
Besides , Lassparri 's got to him first .
But there must be something we can do .
- Who is it ?
- It is I. Rodolfo .
Come in .
Do you mind my dropping down ?
No , of course not .
Only , I was just going to take a nap .
- Rosa , why do you do this to me ?
- Do what , Rodolfo ?
Whenever I want to see you , you make some excuse .
You will not dine with me , ride with me , or even take a walk with me .
But , Rodolfo , you know how busy I am .
My debut in America .
Have you forgotten that it was I ... who brought about your debut in America ?
No , I haven 't forgotten .
Then why do you treat me this way ?
Rodolfo , I must ask you to leave .
Come now , my dear .
Be sensible .
If you ask me , I think she 's being very sensible .
Baroni .
Now I understand .
You did not tell me you had a previous engagement .
Now you know it .
And I apologize .
Now , permit me to withdraw .
In a boudoir , two are company , three a crowd .
- Just what do you mean by that ?
- Please , Riccardo .
Surely I have made my meaning clear .
Riccardo !
You have not heard the end of this .
- I 'm sure I haven 't .
- You may be very sure .
- Good afternoon , Mr. Driftwood .
- Good afternoon .
- Ready for the opening tonight ?
- Am I ?
That 's all right , boys .
I was young myself once .
Thank you .
Good morning , Mr. Driftwood .
- How are all my songbirds ?
- Fine .
Splendid .
Sing well tonight , now .
Waiting for you , Mr. Driftwood .
Step right in .
Thank you , Otto .
- Nice day , isn 't it ?
- It has its points .
Here you are , sir .
- Thank you , Otto .
- That 's all right , Mr. Driftwood .
What 's all this ?
What 's going on here ?
You mean , what 's coming off here ?
- You can 't do that .
- Wanna bet ?
But that 's my office .
I 'm taking orders from Mr. Gottlieb .
Go see him about it .
I 'll see Mr. Gottlieb , and I 'll break you , my fine fellow .
Go see Mr. Gottlieb .
What 's the meaning of this ?
If you think that I 'm going to ...
If you 're busy , I 'll return later .
Just a minute , Mr. Driftwood .
We have some news for you .
News ? For me ?
Mrs. Claypool has decided to dispense with your services immediately .
Dispense with my services ?
She hasn 't even had them .
I warned you , if you continued to associate with those men ... everything would be over between us .
And you 've been associating with them .
How do you know ?
You couldn 't find them .
You 've disgraced me , and the entire Opera Company .
As Mrs. Claypool 's new business manager ... I must request you to get out and stay out .
Just a minute .
You can 't fire me without two weeks ' salary .
That 's in section 10-A of my contract .
I find that you have overdrawn your salary for the next six months .
- In that case , I 'll take one week 's salary .
- You 'll take nothing .
Get out .
If that 's your best offer , I 'll get out , but I 'm not making a nickel on it .
As for you , Mrs. Claypool , I withdraw my offer of marriage .
And that goes for you , too .
The thanks I get for working my fingers to the bone .
- All right , Otto .
- Just a minute .
This car is for officials .
Take the stairs .
- The stairs ?
- Yeah .
Why , that 's four flights .
I can 't walk all that distance .
All right .
I 'll help you .
- Now there 's room .
- That 's all I needed .
I 'm certainly glad I met you boys .
First you get me fired , then you get me thrown out of my hotel ... and finally you push me off a park bench .
There 's one consolation .
Nothing more can happen to me .
Get off of the grass .
I was wrong .
People drink too much water , anyhow .
I 'm certainly glad you came along .
When I met you boys , I had a good job and was about to marry a rich widow .
Now I can 't even sit on the grass .
I 'd give you my seat , but I 'm sitting here .
That 's an offer .
I 'd like to think it over for a couple of days .
Where can I find you ?
Don 't worry .
Wherever you are , you 'll find us .
I 'm sick of that .
Let 's meet somewhere else .
It 's Rosa .
At least I can get my bench back .
Don 't feel so badly , Riccardo .
I can 't feel cheerful about being such a hoodoo to you .
We all make things bad for you .
What 's the matter ?
What do you think ?
Lassparri . He 's get Rosa fired .
- Lassparri ?
- He won 't let her sing tonight .
What do you know about that ?
We 've got all day to think of some plan .
And believe me , the way I think , it 'll take all day .
- Good evening , Tim .
- Good evening .
Plenty for you tonight .
- Thank you .
- You 're welcome , sir .
What does this mean ?
Just the man I want to see .
Gottlieb , these are the worst cigars I ever smoked .
Yes , and your ice isn 't cold enough , either .
Get out of here , all of you .
I shall send for the police .
Just a minute .
I 'll tell you what we came here for .
We make you a proposition .
So you 're willing to give yourselves up ?
Yes , if you let Rosa sing .
I 'm managing director , and Rosa does not sing .
But the rest of your proposition ... giving yourselves up , that rather appeals to me .
Give me police headquarters .
Sergeant Henderson , please .
Hello , toots .
What are you doing here ?
This is Mr. Gottlieb 's box .
He couldn 't come , so he gave me his ticket .
And he couldn 't get dressed , so he gave me his clothes .
Shorty , will you toss up that kelly ?
Attaboy .
Here .
Get yourself a stogy .
Who 's ahead ?
Open the door .
Get me police headquarters .
Mrs. Claypool , have you seen Mr. Gottlieb ?
No .
Isn 't he backstage ?
He 's disappeared .
We can 't find him anywhere .
You didn 't look in the right place .
He was to make a speech before the curtain went up .
That 's the cue .
You 'd better say something .
But I never made a speech in my life .
- All right , I 'll take care of it .
- You ?
Ladies and gentlemen ... I guess that takes in most of you .
This is the opening of a new opera season .
A season made possible by the generous checks of Mrs. Claypool .
I 'm sure the familiar strains of Verdi 's music will come back to you tonight ... and Mrs. Claypool 's checks will probably come back in the morning .
Tonight marks the American debut of Rodolfo Lassparri .
Slgnor Lassparri comes from a very famous family .
His mother was a well-known bass singer .
His father was the first man to stuff spaghetti with bicarbonate of soda ... thus causing and curing indigestion at the same time .
Now , on with the opera .
Let joy be unconfined .
Let there be dancing in the streets ... drinking in the saloons , and necking in the parlor .
Play , Don .
I 'll take this side .
It 's none of my business ... but I think there 's a brace of woodpeckers in the orchestra .
Don 't give up , boys .
The cavalry is coming .
- I 'll see you later .
- What are you doing ?
It 's all right .
It 's just the Tarzan in me .
That Schwelnehund .
Peanuts !
Get your fresh roasted peanuts , folks !
They 're nice and hot !
Get your peanuts !
Here you are !
There you are , you ...
What are you laughing at ?
- Those clothes don 't fit you .
- Why you ...
You 're getting to be a good shot , Tomasso .
The opera starts .
Now we really go to work .
The curtain 's up .
- They 've started .
- Now , don 't worry .
Someone open the door here !
Let me out of here !
Herr Gottlieb .
- Where are they ?
Where did they go ?
- What ?
" What , " he asks me .
- Did a couple of men come up here ?
- What ?
" What ? " All I get is " what . "
How would you like to feel the way she looks ?
That is Driftwood 's voice .
- I want him put out of the opera house .
- Yes , sir .
That 's right .
You go talk to him .
We know he 's in the audience someplace .
- Where 's Mr. Gottlieb ?
- The other side of the stage .
Come on , boys .
What was that ?
High " C " or vitamin " D " ?
What 's the matter ?
What happened here ?
Mr. Gottlieb !
Here , give me a hand .
Where are those men ?
Did you catch them ?
No , sir . I 'm sorry .
They 're still out there .
Still out there ?
I have an idea .
Get me two gypsy costumes at once .
Now we 're getting somewhere .
I will not sing unless they are put off there .
Yes , sir .
A battleship in II Trovatorel
Stop !
Don 't you do ...
Herr Gottlieb !
Lassparri , he 's disappeared .
What ?
- Then we haven 't even a tenor .
- Mr. Gottlieb .
- You are Baroni .
- That 's who I am .
Get into a costume quickly .
- What ?
- I want you to sing .
But I have no reputation , Mr. Gottlieb .
Besides , I couldn 't sing with a strange Leonora .
I 've been rehearsing with Miss Castaldi .
- So that 's it .
- That 's it exactly .
All right .
Get them two costumes at once . Quick .
Please , after the opera .
Go ahead . Get ready .
You hear that ?
That 's real singing .
- What ?
- Get off !
Is this the opera house ?
Arrest those men , and this one , too .
- It 's about time .
- Lassparri , where have you been ?
Been ?
Do you know what they did to me ?
I 'll sing them an encore that they 'll never forget .
Never in my life have I received such treatment .
They threw an apple at me .
Watermelons are out of season .
Rosa , Baroni , get out there quick .
No .
I 'm under arrest , Mr. Gottlieb .
- What 's that ?
- Lf they 're arrested , I ought to be , too .
I can 't sing if I 'm arrested .
What do we do ?
We must have them .
They 'll save the entire season .
Well , what is it you want ?
Just a minute .
Let me handle this .
- Quick !
What do you want ?
- First , call off that police dog .
All right , anything .
These men are in this country under false pretenses , and I 'll do my duty .
I 'll be responsible for them .
Besides , they came over here with Mr. Driftwood .
Mr. Driftwood is an employee of the Opera Company .
- Since when ?
- Since Baroni started singing .
Wait till I get a hold of that elevator operator .
All right , anything .
Please , go out and sing .
Wait a minute .
Before he sings , you gotta sign a contract , and I get 10 % .
Yes , and I get 10 % , too .
Now , where were we ?
- " The party of the 10th part ... "
- No .
- " The party of the 11th part ... " - No .

THE LOWER DEPTHS
I 'd never ask you for accounts . We aren 't shopkeepers .
You serve your country , dear Baron , with true patriotic zeal . But money is missing . Too much .
I know it was used for the common good , but the loss of 30,000 rubles is quite regrettable .
Someone less tolerant might ask for explanations , or be shocked that you have no memory of the loan .
You 've something in mind , but it 's still quite worrying .
A secret matter , you may insist .
But my dear Baron , our secret funds are not inexhaustible , alas .
Despite our long friendship , I fear I can no longer turn a blind eye .
My dear Baron , I trust you will not take this amiss .
Thank you .
Is that you , Pépel ?
Yes , it 's me .
I thought Kostylyov would never go to sleep .
Does the money he cheats us out of keep him awake ?
You 'll be glad to have him tomorrow .
- Why tomorrow ?
- As if you didn 't know .
Your big job is tonight , isn 't it ? At the mansion .
That 's none of your business .
Are you hiding something from me ?
You 're wrong .
I give you good advice . What would you do without us to buy what you steal ?
You and your husband profit as well .
I take the risks , and you get the money . Right ?
You know it 'll all be ours one day .
Kostylyov 's old . He won 't live forever .
We 'll go somewhere nice , just the two of us . We 'll start a new life .
And no one will know our past .
There 's no point in daydreaming about us .
- You don 't love me anymore . - Me ?
I 'm warning you , don 't you dare leave me !
I 'd rather see you rot in prison than go off with someone else .
If I go to jail , you and your husband won 't be far behind me .
No one will believe you .
We have friends on the police force .
Good night , Pépel . - Good night .
Be careful tonight .
Don 't worry .
We northerners aren 't easy to catch .
Don 't treat it like a walk in the park .
Alyoshka 's coming .
- So what ?
He 'll wake up the old man .
I told that rascal to never come back .
Come on .
Hey , lodgers !
Hey , lodgers !
Hey , lodgers !
Is that you , Natasha ?
Sorry . I 'm a polite guy .
I meant to wake old Kostylyov .
He gets the money , but I got you !
You 've been out boozing again .
- You know me .
- Aren 't you ashamed ?
You know , I am who I am .
If people don 't like it , too bad .
My boss gave me the sack , but I don 't give a damn .
What 's a boss , anyway ?
A simple misunderstanding !
Go to bed .
Wait . Not yet .
I wrote a jolly little funeral march . Wanna hear it ?
- Be quiet !
- I want to tell the world !
No one 's listening right now .
Tell them tomorrow .
I won 't be drunk then . I 'll have nothing to say .
No one will mind . Go downstairs .
Go on .
Natasha , your eyes are like stars .
Off to bed you go .
Is that you ?
Were you looking for me ?
Yes , it 's me .
And here you are , the two of you . Nice and cozy .
Vassilissa !
Bitch ! Damned bitch !
Forgive me , Lord .
Vassilissa , you drive me to sin .
You make me angry .
You make me swear .
I 've looked everywhere for you .
You should be in bed , but you 're out here on the stairs . Tramp !
Filthy animal !
Clear out .
Clear out , I said .
I 'm the boss around here .
You clear out , thief , or I 'll have you arrested .
Clear out , or I 'll strangle you !
Help me ! Help !
One more dent .
If the boss grumbles , I 'll get you another .
You dropped it on purpose .
- No , I 'm just clumsy .
- You 're clumsy , eh ?
Lucky for me . Otherwise , the way I was choking him ... -
Don 't touch me !
You 're revolting .
Sleep with my sister , I don 't care . Steal if you want . But don 't touch me .
You 're too young to understand .
One thing I do know : Men like you are despicable .
I 'd like to explain , but I 've got a job waiting .
I hope you get caught .
You know ,
God doesn 't favor the prayers of his saints .
Good night , Natasha .
Still up and about , Nastia ?
I get my rest on my feet .
Aren 't you fed up , out here all alone ?
- Aren 't you fed up with what you do ?
- No .
It 's when I 'm here that it gets me .
Everything seems fine , and then suddenly , it 's like a chill comes over me and I 've had enough .
It 's about time .
Stand up straight .
- You stood me up last night .
- You 're still thinking about that ?
You asked me to dinner .
I didn 't have enough left to buy you a sandwich .
- How about tonight ?
- Tonight is different .
I 'll win , and we 'll go wherever you like .
Lend me 1,000 rubles .
At the moment I need them myself .
But if you win ?
Later , dear child .
Banco .
- Good evening , Baron .
- Good evening .
I regret to say this , but perhaps you shouldn 't play tonight .
Why is that ?
Please understand , your debt is ... -
That 's precisely why I 'm here . We 'll settle that tonight .
He who pays his debts grows rich .
You 're dining with him ?
What about me ?
Silly , when that guy has money , he throws it around .
He 's crazy .
- And if he loses ?
- I won 't go .
- How will you know ?
It 's easy to tell . Whether he wins or loses , he always leaves calmly .
He takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth . If he 's won , he lights it . If not , he 's so nervous he can 't light it .
Baron , may I give you a bit of advice ?
Please do .
Don 't gamble anymore .
Impossible , my dear sir .
Banco tonight , my dear Baron ?
Certainly , my dear Count .
- Shall we play ?
- I 'd love to .
Allow me to repay ... -
It was 10,000 rubles , correct ?
- There 's no hurry .
- Debt of honor .
The bank has 16,000 .
- Shall we , Count ?
- With pleasure .
Banco .
Four .
Eight .
Excuse me .
The clock strikes midnight in the city The rich sleep in their featherbeds
The rats scurry through the empty streets The crooks set out on a job They go calmly about their work
All trades are equal on this earth Each has his hour and his task
When stealing is how you live When you steal or murder It 's not the lark you might imagine
Pity the poor boys At the serenading hour
When hearts rest easy That 's when they go to the guillotine Cry for the poor boys
Excuse me .
Care to dance ?
Did you lose ?
I was lucky , but my opponent was even more so .
Quite a game .
- They say you 're in trouble .
- People will talk .
Is there nothing I can do ?
It 's odd . Suddenly I feel that we cared very much for each other .
- Won 't I see you again ?
- Good night , dear .
Pity .
Care to dance , miss ?
Forgive me for keeping you waiting , Baron , but I dozed off .
You have the right .
These late hours aren 't good for your health , Baron .
And his lordship didn 't even return home for dinner . The chicken was delicious .
- You ate it ?
- Yes , sir .
Then why are you complaining ?
A delegation of tradesmen came by . They waited for two hours .
- No matter .
- Creditors ' agents , too .
- Again ?
- Tomorrow they 'll take everything .
- They 're welcome to it .
- It 's no joking matter .
Felix , you can 't imagine what a pest you 're being .
His lordship is too kind .
Wouldn 't you like an employer who paid you regularly ?
Such employers are a dime a dozen , sir .
Then you 'll remember me fondly when I 'm gone ?
Surely the baron is joking .
Anything else , sir ?
- Go to bed , Felix .
- Good night , sir .
- Good night , Felix .
Sleep well , sir .
I won 't be easily awakened .
Please be so kind as to return my gun .
- What ?
- I need it .
- Sorry ?
- Careful , it 's loaded .
Put it down .
- You won 't call for help ?
- Call who ?
- Servants . The police .
- What for ?
- You give your word ?
If I understand correctly , you 're here to rob me .
How funny .
You 've got the wrong house .
The banker lives next door .
- Don 't try to fool me .
- I 'm not .
You 'll be lucky to find 50 rubles in the whole place .
You 're welcome to the rest . It 's no longer mine .
How about a shot for courage ?
Yes ?
Yes .
A drink between colleagues .
No joke ?
You can trust me .
Then let 's have another .
It 's good stuff .
Is your line of work profitable ?
Well , it has its ups and downs .
Somehow the job that 'll put you on easy street never pans out .
That 's life , my friend .
Are you hungry ?
- I wouldn 't want to impose .
But you 'd rob me blind instead ? Hardly logical .
To hell with logic .
I was raised with certain manners .
We 'll say you 're stealing it , then . Better ?
In that case , I don 't mind at all .
- Are you often hungry ?
- It happens .
- Where do you sleep ?
- In a flophouse .
- Happy with your life ?
- Sometimes .
When ?
When ?
I like it in the summer when it 's nice and warm .
I like dozing in the grass .
Is that nice ?
It can be .
- Have you always lived like that ?
- Always . Did you never think such a life wasn 't worth the trouble ?
Such a life ? It 's the only life I know , sir .
You may drop the formalities .
With pleasure .
You lose .
- What were we playing for ?
- Your place in paradise .
- May I take one ?
- Help yourself .
- There 's only one left .
- Take it .
Then we 'll split it .
Here .
Take my case , then .
If you insist .
Pépel , it 's a pity I didn 't meet you before .
Why didn 't you rob me sooner ?
If only I 'd known .
- Are we stopping ?
- I 'm tired .
This is cozy .
It 's a shame to take it off .
- Then keep it .
- I couldn 't .
They 'd give me a hard time at the flophouse .
- What are you doing ?
- Relax .
Only servants are bothered by things like that .
- Will we meet again ?
- Who knows ?
I 'd like to give you a souvenir .
Choose something .
- I couldn 't .
- None of it is mine anyway .
I 'd like that .
Handsome beasts .
- And they 're detachable .
You like it ?
- Very much .
I 've always liked horses .
It 's the only thing I 've ever won :
a prize for horsemanship .
- Can I really have it ?
- And anything else you like .
I don 't care about the rest , but this I like .
This is the real deal !
- It 's bronze .
They didn 't cheat you , buddy .
- One stylish valet .
What style is it ?
- Stylish .
- Three armchairs .
- Take them away .
One large and two small carpets .
Over there .
Four curtains .
One , two , three , four .
- A chandelier with five arms .
- Up there .
- One gilded wooden console , marble top .
- Over there .
Come , gentlemen .
I 'll announce you to the baron .
One allegorical statue .
Allegorical .
There .
... a tapestry by Gob ... - I can 't read it .
Gobelins !
Did the baron sleep well ?
No , but what a pleasure to wake up .
The repossessors are here , sir .
I trust my egg will not be spoiled .
A messenger from the count is waiting , sir .
- Show him in .
- Now ?
- While there 's still something to sit on .
- Quite right , sir .
Shall I raise the blinds ? - If you wish .
Tell me , Felix . Have you ever slept in the grass ?
It would be beneath my dignity , sir .
If anyone says I have , be assured it is slander .
- I didn 't believe it , Felix .
In the grass !
- Shall I show him in ?
- Show him in , Felix .
- Please forgive so early a visit , Baron .
- Please sit down .
- The nature of my visit forbids it .
- Then remain standing .
In view of last night 's incident , the count hereby informs you your presence at the chancellery is no longer required .
- What incident ?
- The 50,000 rubles you lost .
Oh , yes , the secret funds .
The noise is my furniture being sold .
The count intervened on your behalf to accord you an unlimited leave . Without pay .
Thank him for me .
Did he mention the 10,000 rubles I repaid him ?
- Not to me .
- Quite right . Reassure the Count . I 'll go away for a cure .
I 'll send him the address of some quiet spot in case he too needs some rest .
Care for an egg ?
Baron !
Good-bye , sir .
Show the gentleman out .
Sir , a policeman is here .
A burglar was arrested and he claims to know you .
His name 's Pépel .
Pépel 's been arrested ?
Quick , help me dress .
- It 's you .
- Yes , it is .
I wanted you to get caught .
You said God wouldn 't listen .
- God is misinformed . I 'm innocent .
- Tell him yourself ...
- I don 't believe you .
Don 't believe me ?
I swear he gave me those things .
Who ?
A baron . He even invited me for dinner .
- Really ?
- We had veal .
Yeah , roast veal .
When I left , he gave me a bronze statue .
The only thing he 'd ever won : a prize for horsemanship .
A bronze statue ?
The horses you saw on the table .
I saw them , all right ... - I 'm sure you stole them .
Believe what you want .
I don 't care .
Did Vassilissa send you ?
You came on your own ?
You felt sorry for Pépel the thief ?
Sorry ? You got what you deserved .
You were looking to go to prison .
I hope you never get out .
No use getting all worked up .
Good-bye .
- Pépel !
- What ?
I brought you an orange and an apple , and some cigarettes .
I 'd rather have had a kind word .
I can 't .
Thanks anyway .
What is this chair ?
The bailiff said that people must be left something to sit on .
Could they be more sensitive ?
Apparently it 's the law .
Good old Felix , I 'll never return here .
I can hardly restrain my tears , sir .
You are impeccable , Felix .
Tell me , Felix , I owe you a lot in wages , but will all you 've stolen from me be fair compensation ?
Have no worries on that account , sir .
Don 't bother to show me out ... - I know the way .
Farewell , Felix .
In a way , Inspector , I don 't mind landing in jail .
I 'm actually glad .
- Really ?
- Yes . There are certain people I 'm avoiding . You know , bad influences .
You must be thinking ,
" A bad influence on Pépel ?
Must be real scum ! "
You 're absolutely right .
Worse . It 's no laughing matter , I swear .
- Really ?
- Oh , yes .
So on the one hand , I 'd like to stay in prison , but on the other , I 'd like to be released to prove to a certain person that I 'm not what she thinks I am .
She 's so stubborn .
Worse than a mule !
- How interesting .
- Isn 't it ?
So , how about a good deed ?
Drop the charges .
Just to really get her goat .
What is it ?
Come closer .
We 're in for a laugh .
The baron is here in person .
Baron , you honor us too much , coming here on such a trivial matter .
We 'll return your items after we 've dealt with this man .
- What items ?
- The cigarette case and the bronze .
Was something else stolen as well ?
- Nothing was stolen .
Kindly release my dear friend .
Hello , Pépel .
- How are you , Baron ?
I 'd be happy to oblige , Baron , but this man told us such an unbelievable story ... -
But no matter , Baron . You are free to go , dear sir .
Thank you , Baron .
- Coming , Pépel ?
Cigarette ?
- You 're welcome .
- Good-bye , Inspector .
Your humble servant , Baron .
Your tie and shoelaces .
Is everything in order ?
That was kind of you , Baron .
Not so kind , really .
Maybe you 'll return the favor .
How could I ever ?
We may meet again , sooner than you think .
- Where ?
- Let 's let that be a surprise .
Farewell , Pépel .
Good-bye , Baron .
The bronze , and you have the cigarette case already ?
Sign here , please .
- Where ?
There .
Give that back , you dirty thief !
You 're the thief , charging so much for this rubbish .
Look .
Here you go , little man . And if someday someone tells you Pépel 's a thief , you 'll set them straight .
Who starts ?
- Here 's my spade .
- You didn 't have a spade before !
I can 't play with a cheater !
Get out of here !
He 's not here .
- Who ?
- Who do you think ?
Mind your own business .
I came to check on things .
The floor hasn 't been swept .
It 's the actor 's turn .
I don 't care .
If the police come to inspect , I 'll be fined .
And if that happens , I 'll throw you all out .
- What will you live on ?
- Lodgers are easy to come by .
Why don 't you sweep instead of reading all the time ? Have you seen my sister ?
No , I haven 't .
- Doomed Love .
- Give it back !
Stop squabbling and sweep the floor .
Look how filthy it is .
A real pigsty .
Give me my book !
You 're nuts with your book .
You believe all that nonsense ?
This isn 't nonsense !
You 're all too stupid to understand !
Let her read .
If she believes it , it 's true .
Stupid novel .
A pack of lies .
Have pity .
See ?
She 's crying .
She enjoys it . Leave her alone .
Go ahead . It 's your turn .
No . I can 't breathe in all that dust .
It 's harmful to my health .
" Your organism is poisoned by alcohol . "
So the doctor told me yesterday .
" Your organism is poisoned by alcohol . "
Your organo !
Not organo . Organism .
" Your organism is ... - "
Sicambrian !
Sicambrian .
I 'm very serious . My organism is poisoned .
I can 't breathe dust .
- Microbiatic ! - What ?
- It 's a very learned word .
I know tons of others like it .
I read a lot when I was a telegraphist .
And in Hamlet ... - In Hamlet the poet says ... -
Words , words and more words .
There 's a great play .
I played the gravedigger .
You 'd better start playing the sweeper .
You make so much noise .
You bang and bang .
It 's killing my ears .
- Has my wife been in ?
- I don 't know .
You 're a nuisance .
You 've got your spot , your bed , your workbench , yourself ... - and all that for two rubles a month .
I 'll have to charge you half a ruble extra .
Charge me extra for a rope and strangle me .
Why should I ?
What good would that do me ?
On the contrary , may God keep you .
Live as you like , and with that half ruble you give me I 'll light a candle to the Holy Virgin .
It will atone for my sins ... and yours as well .
Don 't you worry about your sins ? You 're a wicked man .
No one likes you or respects you .
You 're a nuisance .
Let me work .
You 're not like the actor . At least he 's a good man .
He doesn 't make noise .
He 's an educated man .
Kostylyov , I don 't have any money .
Will you give me credit ? As a reward for my goodness .
Goodness is not rewarded with gold , my friend . Goodness is the most precious of treasures .
That has nothing to do with what you owe me .
You owe me your goodness free of charge , poor fool .
Wretched old crook !
What a lout .
If you don 't pay me tomorrow , you 're out on the street !
There are lots of others to take your place .
Give me the broom .
You can get back to your dreams , and I don 't mind sweeping .
My organism ... is poisoned by alcohol .
I understand you , my children .
You are poor lost lambs . Black sheep ! Good-for-nothings !
Day after day Night after night Always the same hopelessness
Always waiting Hurry up , Natasha , you lazy girl !
There 's work upstairs .
Why aren 't you in school ?
Resting , Pépel ?
- Yes , I am .
Lucky you , with nothing to do .
What business is it of yours ?
Beat it . Watch how you speak to me !
You forget I 'm the boss around here .
You owe me respect .
Why take that tone with your fellow man ?
- Have you got my money ?
- What money ?
- For the watch . - What watch , my son ?
Don 't play games with me .
Yesterday , you promised me 10 rubles for a watch .
You gave me three . You owe me seven .
Hand it over !
Stop blinking like an old owl .
Don 't get mad ! That watch was ... -
Stolen . You knew that yesterday .
I don 't buy stolen goods .
No kidding , holy man .
Hurry up and give me my money .
All in good time , Pépel .
What crude people !
Well , well .
So it 's all gone ? Your house , clothes , cognac ?
Gone , even the memory .
- So you 'll stay here ?
- Yes . - It isn 't so bad .
- You 'd leave if it was .
That 's another story .
Come on , I 'll find you a bed .
Good old baron .
Here 's a new lodger .
Who is he ?
Just passing through .
- For the night or longer ?
- We 'll see .
You have any papers ?
Lots , but they 're all worthless .
You have any money ?
I 'll vouch for him .
He 's a friend .
Come on .
- King .
- You always get that one .
It 's an old habit . I can 't help it .
- Queen .
- I 've got another , nice and fresh .
This one is free .
The owner 's in jail .
Must have wanted a fresh bed .
Don 't worry , I 'll get you a mattress .
Don 't you want to know why I 'm here ?
No one asks questions around here .
You 're one of us now . It doesn 't matter anyway .
What do you call yourself now ?
Afraid " Baron " would sound ridiculous here ?
Not at all .
- Are you a real baron ?
- As real as can be .
We had a count here once .
A good guy , but he put on airs .
Nobility is like the pox ... - you never get rid of it entirely .
If you 're a baron , stay one .
We 're all free men here .
See , he knows everything .
- What are they playing ?
- Manille .
Know how to play ?
- I know them all .
- Go ahead .
- Your turn .
- Diamonds .
- Play .
- There .
Baron , I 'll leave you with these gentlemen .
Have fun . See you later .
Is there room for one more ?
- Got money to lose ?
- Fifty kopecks .
- Sit right down . - Give him your seat .
Whose deal is it ?
Yours .
Mine ?
If I only had five kopecks .
- What for ?
- To drink .
Don 't drink .
It 's bad for you .
Take this and let us play in peace .
- Thanks .
- Go on , deal .
Grandfather .
What is it , my child ?
Tell me something . Talk to me .
I 'm afraid .
I 've always been afraid .
I 've been beaten so much .
I 've always been hungry , yet I 've always been afraid of taking more than my share .
Does one suffer there as here ?
You 'll want for nothing .
You won 't be afraid .
Death brings peace .
Death is kind to us poor .
You are so good .
You won 't suffer anymore .
It will all disappear .
I tell you , Anna , death is like a mother to us .
- Where 'd you hear that ?
- I didn 't hear it .
It 's my own idea . Faith in something makes it real !
Maybe it does , maybe it doesn 't .
What difference does it make anyway ?
Thank you , Inspector .
God will reward your kindness to a poor old man .
Next Sunday I 'll light a candle for your soul .
Your sister-in-law is a hard worker . Pretty , as well .
I know whereof I speak .
- You think ? - We worry about her .
That 's normal , at her age .
At her age , I was a real live wire , completely wild .
A real prankster !
Even now I enjoy a good laugh . But all in good taste , of course .
When one has my position , dignity must be upheld .
Miss , a pleasure .
Madame , I 'll visit again very soon .
I really like this house .
- Good-bye , Inspector .
- My respects , Inspector .
Don 't bother to show me out . I know the way .
As you wish , Inspector .
Why are you just standing around ?
Go finish your curtain .
Listen , did you see how the inspector looked at Natasha ?
What do you think ?
- I don 't understand .
You never do .
You need that man .
The just man is always vulnerable . It 's a cruel world .
And with Pépel 's carelessness ... -
Not to mention all the others .
And all the merchandise I 've got in stock .
- Stolen merchandise .
- Not all of it .
You knew the risks in being a fence .
A fence did you say ?
Bitch !
I picked you out of the gutter .
Come in .
What is it ?
Anna just died .
Well , now . What a life !
I must go to the police station and make a statement .
The police will come .
Go downstairs .
Anna died . Lay her out as best as you can .
Hurry up , lazybones !
Imagine her coming here to die . Wasn 't there anywhere else ?
Pépel , aren 't you ... -
God have mercy on her soul .
- Running off ?
- I 'm going for a walk . I 've had enough of all this .
- Had enough of me , too ?
I 'm not the clinging type .
You can 't force love , can you ?
Thanks for the truth .
What truth ?
It 's over between us .
You look at me like you didn 't know me .
But I do .
You 're a pretty woman , Vassilissa . You 've got what it takes ... but my heart never beat for you .
It wasn 't always like that .
Even then , it wasn 't love .
Any regrets ?
Yes , in a way .
You 're heartless .
Do you regret everything ?
Not everything . But pleasure isn 't enough in itself .
What I really wanted was someone to tame me , gently , tenderly , like you would a wild animal . Someone who 'd try to make me into another man .
There 's someone else .
It 's obvious . I won 't be humiliated .
When I get ahold of your sweetheart , she 'll pay for it .
This is a slap in the face , Pépel , and I won 't take it sitting down .
Don 't be mad . Let 's make it a clean break .
You ever think maybe I wanted something else , too ?
Think you 're the only one who wants to escape this mess ?
I can 't stand it . I 'm suffocating here .
I was counting on you to get me out of here .
You were my only hope .
Get rid of my husband for me .
He 's old and evil . It would be a good deed .
That 's a nice combination :
a husband in the ground and a lover in the joint .
Why in the joint ? Kostylyov could have an accident .
He 's always exploited you .
Remember last year ? You went to jail because of him !
You disgust me .
You refuse to help me ?
Watch out , Pépel . It 's dangerous to cross me !
You 're all bark and no bite .
Not one word of pity . From anyone !
- Don 't be shocked .
How can we pity the dead when we have no pity for the living ? We don 't even pity ourselves .
Come on . This is no place for you .
- I don 't like the dead .
- Why should you ? Love the living .
What incredible luck !
Magnificent round .
But the one time I finally win , it 's for a pittance a point .
- Buying the drinks ?
- Of course . - Keep it down .
- It doesn 't matter .
Neither words nor noise can bother the dead .
Anyway , she 's better off dead .
Lord , why did she even live ?
We 're born , we live , we die .
It 's nothing to cry over .
I 'll die in a flophouse too , someday .
Nonsense . Your life is just beginning .
It might be different . Why kid myself ?
No , try to understand .
No man ever loved Anna .
Perhaps a bit of love would 've changed everything .
What man is there here to love me ?
Drunks and thieves ? Drunks aren 't always drunk , nor thieves always in prison .
Everyone gets a break sometime .
Listen , Natasha .
You ought to come away with me .
Why ? You have to love a man to do that .
There are days when I hate you with all my heart !
I think real love should be blind to faults , and I see yours clear as day .
What 's the difference if you beat me or my sister does ?
I 'd sooner break my own arm than harm you .
No , Pépel .
The man I 'll love won 't be from here . He 'll have a job and he 'll work . He 'll walk down the street without worrying about the police .
It 's Pépel . And I never suspected .
I see .
You want the same breed , just younger .
Get out , you little hypocrite !
- Calm down !
- This is my man !
His clothes are mine ! I 'll have you beaten and thrown out !
Little slut !
- Will you calm down ?
Go ahead , hit me .
Insult me . Go upstairs .
You 're acting like a fool ! And over nothing .
You 'll never have her , Pépel .
Not her . I just want peace .
Keep it up and you 'll get your peace the same way Anna did .
Every night he came to the garden .
I trembled with fear and sadness .
He was pale , too , clutching his revolver .
Such hotheads , these students !
" My tender love , " he murmured .
My tender love !
- Don 't stop her from lying .
- Go on , Nastia . He called me his " boundless love . "
" My parents oppose this marriage and threaten to disown me , so I 've decided to end it all . "
He raised his pistol , loaded with 10 bullets .
" Farewell , " he said . " I can 't live without you . "
I answered , " My unforgettable Villiam ... - "
William .
It was Gaston the other day .
Stop teasing the poor girl .
Show some respect . It 's not what she says that matters , but why she says it .
- Go on .
- We 're listening .
They 're just jealous because they have nothing to tell .
No , I 'll say no more .
I said to him , " Light of my life , nor can I live without you on this earth .
I 'll love you as long as I live , but don 't sacrifice your young life for me .
Go , leave me .
I 'll spend all my days weeping for you .
- Don 't cry . - What an idiot !
And it 's all from Doomed Love .
Shut up ! You 're so low , nothing moves you .
I believe you , dear .
You had a great love .
You 're telling the truth .
He was a student , you know .
His name was Gaston . He had a black goatee and patent-leather shoes .
God strike me dead if I 'm lying !
He loved me like I loved him !
Patent-leather shoes , of course . A real student .
A search ?
Lord , spare me such a trial !
But what am I accused of ?
Am I not a good citizen ?
I pay my taxes , though God knows they 're high .
I respect the authorities .
Kostylyov , this is not my doing . I just came to give you a friendly warning .
Someone high up has their eye on you .
I can 't risk my position .
Can 't we work something out ?
If it 's a question of money , in spite of my poverty , I could make a sacrifice .
It 's a touchy situation .
You 're in a bind , and I don 't want to be dragged into it .
It 's so hot today !
May I offer you some tea ?
Please don 't bother .
I insist . I 'll call Natasha .
She makes wonderful tea .
Excellent idea .
But is your sister really here ? I thought she was out .
Oh , no .
She just ... -
We 'll have someone call her .
A little woman like her is just what I need . A sweet and lively housewife .
It 's simple , Inspector . She does everything here .
A hard worker , inexpensive , easy to feed .
She 's full of virtues .
All that and a pretty face , too .
The truth is , she 's healthy and well-built .
With all the work in this house ,
I don 't know what we 'd do without her .
But for you , no sacrifice is too great .
Yes , but would she have me ?
Don 't worry . I 'll see to it .
I meant , she 'd be most flattered by your attention .
Lord , first you send down these troubles upon me , and now you take Natasha away .
About those troubles ... perhaps we can work something out .
Listen , leave the washing .
Go make some tea . It isn 't time yet .
We have a guest .
- The inspector .
- I 'm not going .
Why not ?
I don 't like him .
He 's fat and sweaty .
Men who sweat like that are disgusting .
I don 't want to see him .
How dare you speak to me that way ?
Don 't you realize we need that man ?
If he wanted , he could arrest us tomorrow , or take away Kostylyov 's housing license .
In any case , he could ruin us .
You 're nothing but an ungrateful wretch .
What does he want , anyway ? To see you for a moment .
That 's not much . And it 'll get us out of this mess .
Have you no heart ?
Don 't forget that we 've fed you , sheltered you , saved you from the gutter .
Enough .
I 'll go . They look after people like me ?
Where ? In ... -
I 've forgotten the name of the town , but I 'll remember .
There 's a magnificent hospital with marble floors and columns . It 's bright and airy .
You breathe freely . A palace .
- Marble .
Doctors in white coats look after you with great kindness .
Until then , get ready to be healed .
You 'll start a new life .
A little tea in a family setting now and then is just the thing .
It makes me forget my administrative headaches .
Miss ?
May I ask a favor ?
We could go out on Sunday .
We could go to dinner anywhere you please .
Would you like that ?
- Certainly she would . My sister never gets out .
- The poor child .
What an honor for her . Isn 't it , Natasha ?
Don 't cry . I don 't want to hurt you . Just the opposite .
The idiot !
She 'll ruin everything .
My dream is to protect you .
Why refuse before you hear me out ? You 'd live like a queen .
Believe me .
Accept before it 's too late .
Old Kostylyov can 't be easy to live with . And the others in the courtyard .
Look at them . Wallowing like pigs .
Is that any life for you ?
I say it isn 't .
And that 's all I have to say .
I dreamed I was fishing and caught a huge bream .
It must 've weighed five pounds . A real dream fish .
And then ... - And then your line broke , and you woke up . And the bream was Vassilissa .
No , she makes me sick .
Everything here makes me sick . Everything you touch is filthy . The mattress , the pots ... - everything 's rotten .
The feelings , even the words you say ... - covered in lice , cockroaches and slime .
Fishing for bream didn 't work out so well .
Next time , dream about a different fish .
And Nastia with her Gaston , and the actor with his organism .
I 'm tired of listening to them .
I need a change .
I 'm sick and tired of them .
Are you tired of me ?
Of course not , you 're different . You don 't lie . You don 't go on about why you 're here .
That 'd be hard to do . I don 't know how I got here .
There 's a kind of fog in my noggin .
When I look back , it seems all I did was change uniforms .
First the schoolboy , then the student .
I 've forgotten everything I ever learned at the university .
I got married , wore a tailcoat , then a dressing gown .
What was the point ?
I wore the uniform of a government official and grew poorer . My clothes became more and more threadbare .
Finally I wear these , the last of the line .
And it all seems like a dream .
Isn 't it absurd ?
Ever been to prison ?
That would have been one more uniform .
- And you ?
- No , not yet . But it 'll happen sooner or later .
My path was laid out for me by my father .
Poor guy spent his life in prison and urged me to follow in his footsteps , so ... -
His concern for you does him credit .
Is he dead ?
- Yes . He died in prison , just as I will .
The only thing that could change my father 's prediction is if Natasha ran away with me .
- Really ?
- Yeah . If she 'd just throw her arms around me and say ,
" Pépel , I believe in you . You 'll protect me . " No more Pépel the thief .
I 'd be a new man . We 'd go far away , far from all this filth and rottenness !
What about you , Baron ?
- I 'll stay here .
Once you told me how nice it was to doze in the grass .
I didn 't really believe you then , but I do now .
Pepper ?
I don 't care .
Mustard ?
- I don 't care . - She doesn 't care .
I 'll serve you myself .
Salad ?
I want to save you from that brute Kostylyov .
Don 't be a hypocrite . You know my sister made me come .
So what ?
Isn 't it nice here ?
We can come every Sunday . Every day of the week .
Believe me when I say I want to treat you like a little queen .
You 're no king .
No king ! She 's so witty !
Tell your king you 're not angry .
Have mercy .
Make me drink until I forget everything .
Get me stewed to the gills , otherwise I 'll never agree to be your queen .
For that you must agree to drink something !
Come , my little treasure .
Leave it to me .
In one hour , you won 't even remember your mother 's name .
- What are you doing here ?
- Am I bothering you ?
- I came here to get away from you .
- Looking for my sister , no doubt .
Why are you avoiding me ?
I told you . It 's over between us .
You 're driving me crazy , always after me .
I 'm sick of your stories , sick of your face !
Get it ? - What 's wrong with me ?
- You 're selfish .
You 'd do anything to get what you want .
And her , with her great big eyes and clumsy hands , what can she give you ?
That 's my business . What if she 's making a fool of you ? What if the sweet rose , the holy saint , was like everyone else :
selling to the highest bidder ?
I don 't believe it .
Poor fool .
Know where she is ?
It 's the story of the paté made of lark :
half lark and half horse .
One lark .
You 're not following .
One lark , and one horse .
- One horse .
Where 'd my cigar go ?
Tell me the one about the fat shopkeeper .
- Where 's my cigar ?
- It 's too much !
Where is he ?
I asked where he was .
What do you want ?
How dare you come in here !
Oh , it 's you .
This won 't take long .
Get out or I 'll call the police .
Natasha , we need to talk , but this place disgusts me .
What right do you have to order me around ?
I 'm not Vassilissa .
Let me go ! - Exactly !
What right ? Don 't touch her , you thief !
Vagabond ! Hoodlum ! Pimp !
Go back to Vassilissa !
Shut up . Vassilissa 's money isn 't enough .
You want her sister too !
Let go .
You 're hurting me . You 're hurting me , too , you know .
Come on . Help !
Murderer ! Hoodlum !
Pimp !
He 's killing me ! Police !
What is this ?
Get the police . I didn 't do anything .
To hell with your champagne !
A bit of ice , Inspector . It 'll do you good .
Settle down .
It 's nice and cold .
- The fresh air is helping already . Little fool .
Sure you 're not nuts ?
I think you twisted my arm .
That 's not all . I 'd twist your neck to stop you .
I don 't have a choice .
What else can I do with my life ?
Unless I follow Anna into the hereafter .
No , you 're not going to follow Anna .
- Then who ?
- Me . Where ?
To prison ? Natasha , try to understand me .
It 's true ...
- I 'm a thief . No one ever taught me anything else .
My father was the same , and even before I could walk , people called me a thief .
Maybe if they hadn 't , things would 've been different .
Tell me , Natasha .
Won 't you try to understand me ?
Believe me .
Suppose I did ? If you believed me , I swear I 'd give it all up , stealing and all this filth .
We 'd go away together , anywhere .
Far away .
I 'd work . I can read and write .
I 'm a good locksmith .
I 'm strong , and with you in my arms , I 'd be even stronger .
I 'd move mountains ! Just say you trust me .
- Silly Pépel .
- Why ?
- Are you blind ?
- What do you mean ? - Don 't you understand ?
- Tell me .
I love you , Pépel . I 'll follow you anywhere .
Wicked girl !
Don 't you realize you 're sinning against God ?
Don 't bother taking that off .
Go to your fiancé , right now , and beg forgiveness .
I won 't ! You have no idea how angry I am !
Go apologize !
- I won 't !
- Obey him !
I won 't !
Let go !
You won 't go ?
That 's Natasha screaming !
Filth !
Get upstairs quick .
Natasha needs you .
Did they hurt you ?
Get off me !
Careful , Pépel ! This is a family matter !
Have you no shame ?
If you touch her , you 'll answer to me !
Let me at that bastard !
Let me go !
Let me at him !
A pretty pickle .
This looks bad . Here come the police .
Kostylyov 's been murdered .
Pépel killed him .
Yes , Pépel did it .
I saw it with my own eyes .
It was Pépel .
He 's upstairs . What are you waiting for ?
It wasn 't a murder .
It was a brawl . We 're all just as guilty as Pépel .
He was an old bastard . His lack of kindness was what killed him .
I got a few licks in , too ! He was about done for .
- I kicked him ... -
- We don 't know who hit him . I hit him , too !
The lower depths killed him , not just Pépel .
- Quiet , old fool .
- It 's the truth .
- Where is he ?
- Upstairs with my sister .
It 's carnival today All the world is celebrating Wearing unique costumes
I 'm leaving .
You hear me ?
All my life I 've wanted to escape from here .
I 'm finally leaving . Hey , silly goose .
What are you sniveling about ?
What will you do ?
I 'll wait for him .
He 'll leave , you 'll see .
Who 's " he " ?
Who 's he ?
Me . You 're so modest , he of the confused genius .
Where will you go ?
To look for a town , a hospital .
A big , bright , clean hospital , all marble and no dust . I 'll get better there .
I 'll be myself again .
I 'll be on the path to rebirth , as King Lear said .
I 'll regain my name , my stage name .
No one knows it here .
You don 't know what it 's like to lose your name .
My name .
Even a dog has a name , but not me !
That Louka was a dangerous charlatan .
He 's turned your head with his lies , poor actor .
You 're the liar , charlatan .
Shut up , milady .
Louka was senile . Baron , tell the truth :
Was Louka lying ? He lied all day long .
Was he lying about the place where drunkards can be cured ?
He meant if you keep drinking , you 'll end up in the madhouse .
- The madhouse ?
- The madhouse .
Don 't listen . If Louka said so , it must be possible .
The madhouse ?
You 're a real baron . Even in rags you 're a menace .
Little louse .
Can 't you play something more cheerful ?
" Sit , Jessica .
Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold .
There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold 'st but in his motion like an angel sings , still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims .
Such harmony is in immortal souls . But whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in , we cannot hear it . "
Harmony .
Come .
" To die , to sleep , no more . And by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to .
To die , to sleep , no more . And by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to . "
Listen to the actor .
He 's got talent .
Well , Baron , I have nothing to give you as a souvenir .
So let 's divide up the stables . Take one .
- You have any money ?
- I 've got 40 rubles .
That 's enough .
Good-bye . Good-bye , Nastia .
You 're a true friend .
Forty rubles .
Forty rubles .
For two people . That 's what I said : 40 rubles .
Sentinel , keep close watch I could never lie to you
I would prefer my freedom
Come quick !
It 's serious .
The actor 's hung himself .
Tonight the singing 's come to an end .
Come on .
Let 's get moving .
Now listen , Mr. Gibson .
You 're not going to stop me and no one else is going to stop me .
I 'm going on this vacation whether you like it or not !
And if you want to throw me out , why don 't you ?
Yes , you know I 'm right .
Now don 't bring up any arguments like that .
Yes , you brought me here from Detroit , but you didn 't do it for my sake .
You did it because you wanted a good engineer , and I 've done a swell job .
Now , let me tell you , Mr. Gibson ...
I 'm not going back to Detroit before I have my vacation and if you don 't like it , you can take my job and you know what you can do with it ?
Right .
Mr. Gibson wants to see you .
Tell him I 'll be right in .
Yes , Mr. Bradley .
- Well , Mr. Gibson ?
- Well , Mr. Bradley ?
It 's all right .
You can have your vacation .
I can have my ...
Well , thank you , Mr. Gibson .
You don 't have to thank me .
Everyone in Detroit recognises that .
Well , they don 't know much in Detroit .
Enough to like your ideas about the new carburettor very much .
They want you back home by the 15th at the latest .
- The 15th ?
- Yeah .
- Well , that ...
That gives me two weeks .
- That 's right .
Where are you going ?
- Spain .
- Spain , huh ?
I 've always wanted to go there , ever since I was a kid .
I 've read every book about Spain .
Imagine me , Tom Bradley from Detroit , born in Peoria being in Madrid tomorrow , seeing a bullfight .
Sitting next to a beautiful señorita .
When everybody else is watching the bull , she 'll be watching me .
I 'll see to that .
- Here are the signs for Mr. Bradley 's car , sir .
- Thank you .
What car ?
I forgot to tell you .
To show you how much we appreciate your services ...
- we 're lending you a car for your trip .
- Well , that 's great !
But we thought we might as well utilise you for a little publicity .
You won 't mind using one of these signs on the car , will you ?
- No .
- Let 's see which one is the best .
- It 's difficult to decide .
- It must be tough , Mr. Gibson , very tough .
" I am delighted to drive a Bronson 8 . "
" I am glad to drive a Bronson 8 . "
I 'm delighted .
I 'm glad .
Let me hear you read them once , will you ?
" I am delighted to drive a Bronson 8 .
I am glad to drive a Bronson 8 . "
Try it the other way once , please .
" I 'm glad to drive a Bronson 8 .
I 'm delighted to drive a Bronson 8 . "
We 'll take " delighted . " It 's class .
That 's the trouble .
It 's too snooty .
People who make under a $ 100 a week are never delighted .
They 're tickled to death , and they buy our cars .
You 're right .
We 'll take " glad . "
That 's no good , either .
" Glad " is a weak word .
For instance , I 'm walking down the boulevard and just looking around out for a good time , and instead , who do I meet ?
You .
What do I say to you ?
" Glad to see you , Mr. Gibson . "
I tell you , " glad " is the wrong word .
Well , take another example .
If I 'm going around with a girl and I don 't like her anymore ... I 'm glad to get rid of her .
But after I get rid of her ...
Oh , boy !
Hey ! Where do you think you 're going ?
Spain .
Get back .
Tell Charles to come back .
I don 't want any commotion .
Very good , madam .
Charles !
- What can I do for madame ?
- I would like to see some pearls .
- Necklace , madame ?
- Please .
Now if madame can give me some idea of the price .
If monsieur could give me some idea of the pearls .
Well , we have a considerable variety .
Anything from 10,000 francs up to a million .
And a few pieces , extraordinary , rare pieces even up to two million .
If it 's really rare , it can be three million .
I think M. Duvalle would like to attend to you himself .
Madame , will you be good enough to step this way ?
If you please , madame .
I 've never seen her before .
- You wanted to see some pearls , madame ?
- Please .
Henri , please bring the Gourdet necklace .
The Don Dedeieront , the Caillot .
- Cigarette ?
- Thank you , I don 't smoke .
Nor do I. A barbarian custom .
One fills one 's lungs and other people 's eyes with smoke .
I believe we haven 't had the pleasure of serving you before , Madame ...
- Pauquet .
- Mme. Pauquet ?
Not Mme. Jules Pauquet , by any chance ?
That would be charming .
No , monsieur .
Not Mme. Jules Pauquet .
Excuse me , madame .
How much ?
It took four-and-a-half years to collect , madame .
- Time and effort were of no consideration .
- How much ?
I have made up my mind to accept 2,200,000 francs .
2,200,000 francs .
Four-and-a-half years of work , madame .
Every pearl is matched and flawless .
Believe me , madame , even at that price ...
I am not in the habit of bargaining when I see something I want .
And I want this necklace .
I would like to wear it tonight .
The address is 145 Rue de I 'Elysée .
145 , Rue de I 'Elysée , Mme. Pauquet .
Mme. Maurice Pauquet .
Maurice Pauquet !
Dr. Pauquet , the nerve specialist ?
Yes , he 's my husband .
Do you know him ?
No , but who has not heard of him in Paris ?
Unfortunately , I have never had the pleasure of meeting him .
- Maybe you would like to meet him ?
- But , madame , of course .
All right .
Would you bring the pearls to my husband 's office at 6 : 00 ?
And my husband will give you the cheque .
Thank you , madame .
It will be an honour to meet the doctor .
And one never knows when one will go crazy .
- Goodbye , madame , and a thousand thanks .
- Goodbye , monsieur .
- Dr. Pauquet ?
- Yes , madame .
Would you please be seated ?
- Your name , please ?
- Mme. Duvalle .
Mme. Aristide Duvalle .
Aristide Duvalle , the famous jeweller ?
Yes , I am his wife .
Do you know him ?
I 've never had that pleasure , but of course I 've heard of him .
Who hasn 't in Paris ?
That 's what makes it so much worse .
Doctor , I ...
It 's too terrible to speak of .
No .
Come , come , come now .
Do you want me to have you for a patient ?
You 're right .
I must be calm for his sake .
You see , all of a sudden , for the past few weeks my husband has been suffering from ...
Well , I suppose you would call it hallucinations .
Can you tell me the symptoms ?
They are different .
- He has an obsession about money .
- Who hasn 't nowadays ?
But better times will cure these things .
I doubt if you have much to worry about if it 's just a question of money .
But it isn 't .
Doctor ...
It 's too embarrassing .
You are talking to your doctor , madame .
When we were married , he was such a strong , virile man and now ...
Doctor sometimes he imagines he 's a schoolgirl running away from school .
Oh .
And do you know , he has given up pyjamas and taken to wearing nightgowns ?
I don 't like that .
I don 't like it , either .
It 's all so hopeless .
Not at all , madame .
Modern psychiatry has a way of dealing with these problems .
Believe me , a few careful treatments and we 'll have him out of his nightgowns and back into pyjamas in no time .
- He belongs in them .
- Unquestionably .
Now shall we make an appointment for him ?
That 's not so easy to do .
He has grown so suspicious of people .
The commonest of symptoms .
I 'm sure if I managed to bring him here and he found others around ...
Is there any chance he could see you alone ?
After office hours , I occasionally make an exception .
Shall we say tonight , maybe at 6 : 00 ?
Very well , let 's say tonight then , at 6 : 00 .
- I don 't know how to thank you .
- By not worrying too much .
I 'll try not to .
- Goodbye , Doctor , and thank you again .
- Goodbye , madame .
Doctor , there 's one other thing .
I don 't know how important it is , but I think I should mention it before you see him .
Just imagine , this very shrewd , honest man for whom everyone in the business world has the highest respect again and again presents bills to people who don 't owe him anything .
- Dementia praesenilis .
- It 's frightening .
He does it everywhere , and to people he never even met before .
I wouldn 't be a bit surprised if he comes in here and presents you with a bill .
Don 't worry about that , madame .
I 'll take care of the bill .
- Just leave it to me .
- I shall , Doctor .
Come in .
I 'm sorry , my husband is late .
I 'm sure he 'll be here any minute .
No hurry .
I have some work to keep me busy .
Good evening , M. Duvalle .
- Good evening , madame .
- You 're very prompt .
I was afraid I might be late .
My dressmaker detained me . Come in .
- Cigarette , M. Duvalle ?
- I don 't smoke .
Oh , yes , I forgot .
We have that in common .
And more .
- We both love pearls , don 't we ?
- Yes , madame .
- You have the necklace with you ?
- Of course .
You know , M. Duvalle , my conscience is beginning to bother me .
Should I really induce my husband to spend so much money ?
Are the pearls really worth it ?
But , madame !
Look at them again .
Here , by the light .
What symmetry .
What art .
These are not pearls . They are the tears of mermaids , madame .
How beautifully you speak .
I believe you could sell me anything , monsieur .
And if you should change your mind , let us say , within the next two years ... I will only be too glad to take them back .
You don 't know me , M. Duvalle .
If I take these pearls , you will never see them again .
You can depend on that .
I am certain of you , madame .
- And now shall we see my husband ? - Please .
- May we come in ?
- Why , of course .
May I introduce M. Duvalle , Dr. Pauquet .
How do you do , M. Duvalle ?
An honour , Doctor , to make your acquaintance .
Well , the Doctor will take care of everything , won 't you ?
- I will do my best .
- Thank you .
I think I 'd better leave you two gentlemen alone for a while .
Perhaps it would be better .
I 'm sure it would be .
- Charming woman .
- Charming .
Would you please be seated , M. Duvalle ?
Thank you .
Aristide Duvalle , right ?
Just make it out to Duvalle and Company .
Well , M. Duvalle , you can have absolute confidence in me .
Well , Dr. Pauquet , of course .
If I could not trust you , I could not do business with anyone .
- That 's very flattering .
- No , no .
It 's justified , I 'm sure .
Thank you .
- Now , could we get down to business ?
- Gladly .
Just as you say .
This bill is made out to me .
Naturally .
Of course .
2,200,000 francs .
Tell me , M. Duvalle , exactly how did you arrive at this figure ?
Dr. Pauquet , I can show you my books .
It cost me two million .
- Is 10 % too much profit ?
- No , no , no , of course not .
Very fair .
- Thank you .
- Very fair .
How do you sleep ?
How do I sleep ?
Oh , fine . Fine .
- And you ?
- Fine . Fine , thank you .
- Which side do you sleep on , your left ?
- No .
- Your right ?
- No .
I ...
- On your back ?
- Doctor , I can 't see what difference ...
I 'm sorry , M. Duvalle , but you must answer all my questions clearly before we can proceed any further .
Now tell me , which side do you sleep on ?
Your left , your right , or on your back ?
I sleep on my stomach .
Why don 't you like pyjamas ?
- Pyjamas !
Pyjamas !
What about pyjamas ?
- Well , what about them ?
Doctor , if you would just give me my cheque and let me go .
Now , M. Duvalle , Aristide Duvalle .
Look at me . Now , tell me .
Why do you want 2,200,000 francs ?
For the pearls I have given to your wife .
Listen to me .
I don 't owe you 2,200,000 francs .
You didn 't give any pearls to my wife .
I don 't have a wife .
You owe me 2,200,000 francs .
I have given the pearls to your wife , and I think you are crazy !
That 's bad , definitely bad .
Now , M. Duvalle , don 't worry .
Everything is going to be quite all right .
Now tell me , where do you buy your nightgowns ?
Nightgowns ?
Nightgowns ?
I never bought a nightgown in my life .
I am a bachelor .
And that beautiful , charming lady who just left this room ? Who is she ?
- She is your wife .
- Oh , no , she is your wife .
- She is your wife .
- She is your wife .
She is your wife .
Come now , man , pull yourself together .
- I tell you she is your wife ! - She is your wife !
I 'm driving , I 'm driving , I 'm driving I 'm driving , I 'm driving ...
A Bronson 8
A Bronson 8 I am driving ...
I 'm driving a Bronson 8
A car for the masses ...
Will you help me stop that horn ?
Where 's the owner of this car ?
I 'm going to punch him in the nose .
Where is he ?
Here .
I must ask you to stop that horn at once .
Stop that noise .
You have to wait your turn .
It 's her car .
I have nothing to do with it .
I beg your pardon , monsieur .
I don 't know if you 've noticed it , but I 'm having a little trouble with my car .
I tried to blow my horn but I 'm afraid I must have pushed it too hard and now it 's stuck .
It 's really a situation where a woman is helpless .
You look like an experienced motorist , if I may say so .
Would it be too much to ask you to give me a helping hand ?
Thank you for your assistance .
Well , that licks me .
First you throw mud in my face and now you want me to kiss your hand .
Continental !
Thank you , monsieur .
Please , don 't mention it .
It was a pleasure .
Now look , this car may get you into trouble .
That horn may get stuck again any minute .
I was just thinking it might be a good idea if I followed you .
I mean , to take care of the horn .
Oh , no , please !
You 're going to Spain . I 'm going to Spain .
I 'm on a vacation and it doesn 't make any difference where I go , right ?
But look , let 's agree on one thing .
Let 's not go so fast .
Let 's take our time and see the mountains and the little villages and enjoy it .
People will wait for you .
I would .
I want to apologise for all the trouble I have caused you and to thank you for all the help you 've given me but I must insist that you do not follow me .
And if you would do me a special favour , please leave me alone , right now .
I 'm sorry .
Get your luggage ready for inspection .
Step inside the Customs Building .
- I ...
- Don 't thank me or I 'll start your horn again .
Your bag , please .
All right , next one , please .
- Anything to declare ?
- Nothing .
All right .
- Anything to declare ?
- Not a thing .
Socks .
100 pesetas fine .
There 's something wrong with my car .
I wonder if you can help me .
Well , I 'll have a look at it .
Well , how did this happen ?
I must have bumped over a big rock .
I don 't see how it could have happened that way .
Maybe when you were fixing the horn you accidentally broke something .
I beg your pardon ?
I 'm a motor engineer .
I build motors , not wreck them .
Well , there 's nothing I can do without any spare parts .
- What are you going to do ?
- Just leave it here and send for it tomorrow .
Will you give me a lift ?
Aren 't you a bit cold driving without a coat ?
I should say not .
It 's beautiful , isn 't It ?
I 'm driving a Bronson 8
A Bronson 8 I am driving ...
- Comfortable ?
- Yes .
Happy ?
I 'm glad you had your accident ...
Do you think our luggage is safe back there ?
Who cares ?
Nothing 's safe in this car .
- But ...
- Don 't you worry , I put yours on the bottom .
If you hear anything fall , it 's my suitcase .
You have nothing to worry about .
That 's fine .
You know , I really am lucky .
If I hadn 't found you , I 'd still be standing in the middle of the road instead of being on my way to San Sebastián .
Is that where we 're going ?
- We ?
- Sure .
I 'll drive you there .
- I am lucky .
- You 're lucky ?
- You mean I am , having you with me .
- Thank you .
It 's just what I 'd always hoped and dreamed for my vacation .
What a vacation .
Do you know what I wish would happen ?
You 'd lose your suitcase . I 'd lose my suitcase .
We 'd lose the car and both be stranded here for 10 days without a soul around us .
I can 't help it , that 's what I wish .
Look over there , that 's Spain !
The birds are singing and the sun 's shining ...
- And the castanets are clicking ...
- And you are probably taking a cold .
- Does that really worry you ?
- It does .
Why ?
Do I have to answer ?
No .
You know , you 're really a nice girl .
A sweet girl .
Just selfish .
If you get a cold , I may get one , too , being so close to you .
You know , it 's getting colder as it gets later and I might have to move a little closer if I get chilly .
I may even put my hands in your pocket .
I am certainly not freezing , but I guess I better get my coat on .
I 'm getting gooseflesh .
I wish you would hurry .
I 'll be through in a second .
Don 't you like it ?
Of course .
But do you think it goes with those trousers ?
Sure , I had it specially made for these pants .
Oh .
- Shall we go now ?
- Yeah , just a second .
I 've got a sign back here I promised to keep clean .
It 's all covered with mud .
Lucky sign .
It 's your mud .
Hey !
Hey , wait a minute !
Hey , where did you get this ?
Will you take me there ?
Take me there ?
Give me those , please .
- Countess de Beaupre , please .
- Whom shall I announce , sir ?
- Prince Margoli .
- Very well , Your Highness .
Countess de Beaupre , please .
The Countess is expecting you . Room 212 , Your Highness .
Thank you .
Keep the change .
- How do you do , Countess ?
- Your Highness .
The years change me , but you remain as enchanting as ever .
Thank you for your words and your flowers .
It 's difficult to tell them apart .
Yellow roses .
You remembered .
It would have been far more difficult to forget .
- Will you please get a vase for these ?
- Very well , Countess .
- Madeleine , where are those pearls ?
- I only wish I knew .
Don 't lie to me .
Where are they ?
I told you over the telephone .
- You know I don 't believe in fairy tales .
Evidently !
Where are those pearls ?
Of course you must be tired .
The journey must have been very strenuous .
Are you staying long in San Sebastián , Your Highness ?
No , no , I 'm afraid I can 't .
I don 't think this climate is good for my health .
The old complaint ?
Yes , it has me constantly on the move .
I think I need a change of altitude myself .
Yes , I was going to suggest that , too .
Why did you wreck the car ?
I couldn 't help it .
They were right on my heels .
- I had to mislead them .
- It 's fantastic .
You 're not trying to double-cross me , by any chance ?
- Don 't be vulgar .
- I 'm sorry .
My close association with lawyers has coarsened me .
Well , we 'll have to get out of here tonight .
This is a fine mess , and all this work for nothing .
No , we must get those pearls back .
Now who was this man ?
An American .
Now that 's a great help .
He ought to be easy to find .
There are only about 100 million Americans .
- What was his name ?
- I don 't know .
Good .
Now , we won 't be hampered in our search by knowing his name .
- What did he look like ?
- He was tall .
One more little clue like that and we ought to have him in our hands .
- Any other distinguishing traits ?
- He seemed to be a man of very good taste .
He liked me .
Didn 't I tell you never to mix love with business ?
Don 't be absurd , Carlos .
This man interests me as much as you do .
That should satisfy you .
I want to tell you something , Madeleine .
I think I 've always behaved as a gentleman .
- And I hope you continue to do so .
- That all depends .
Do you contemplate knocking me down ?
- Not exactly .
But ...
- But what ?
His camera !
Carlos .
Yes .
Yes .
A gentleman to see the Countess ?
I 'm sorry , the Countess is not receiving this afternoon .
Let 's see what he looks like .
Wait a minute .
Were you expecting someone today ?
No .
Well , maybe that man who wanted to speak to you was ...
Yes .
Yes , yes . I was just going to ring you back .
The gentleman who wanted to see the Countess , was he an American ...
Who ?
A gentleman from the police department ?
It 's the police .
Well , I told you , madame is not receiving .
All right , send him up .
Now let 's be calm .
All we can get is five years .
No , seven .
I looked it up .
Now , remember , a slip-up now would be fatal .
Our stories have got to match .
Now , let 's go over it again quickly .
- Who am I ?
- You 're my uncle .
- How did I get this bullet hole in my ribs ?
- Battle on the Marne .
- Who was your mother ?
- Grand Duchess Sandra ...
- who went down on the Lusitania .
- Right .
- And your father was the Grand Duke Sergei .
- Killed by the Bolsheviks .
I know it .
- Good luck , Madeleine .
- Good luck , Carlos .
- Remember .
- Your Highness .
Come in .
Do I have the pleasure of addressing Countess de Beaupre ?
Yes .
May I introduce myself ?
My name is Avilia , from the San Sebastián Police Department .
- Won 't you sit down ?
- Thank you .
Come in .
Thank you .
- Will you excuse me for a minute ?
- Certainly , Countess .
Lord Dunsmore wants us to join him on a Mediterranean cruise .
I beg your pardon .
I was so interested in reading about this case .
You mean the one about the pearl necklace ?
I don 't know how it got in the papers .
It just makes it so much more difficult for me .
The woman in the case seems to be very clever .
Yes , but what makes it so difficult for me is that her description varies .
It 's one of those typical cases where one has to take a chance .
Well , señor , you 'll excuse me . I have an appointment at my hairdresser 's .
Now , Countess ... It 's so silly , but as I told you , I have to do my duty .
You see , this afternoon an American arrived by plane and he has made a complaint . Oh , a fantastic story !
A woman took his car and wrecked it .
He 's taken up so much of my time .
But he threatened to go to the American Consul , so I had no choice .
I had to take the case in my hands .
What could I do ?
I am the police .
We made the rounds of all the hotels , Countess , but the description ...
Fits me ?
Well , it 's absurd , Countess , but it does .
Furthermore , you arrived this afternoon .
It 's all such nonsense , but everything fits .
Now I 'm forced to confront you with this American but , of course , if you will assure me that you ...
- Oh , no .
I insist on seeing this young man .
- Absolutely .
A thousand thanks .
I 'll bring him right up .
No .
He 's taken up too much of your time already . Just send him up .
- I 'm so delighted to have met you , señor .
- Thank you .
- Don 't bother to bring him up here .
- Yes , Countess .
- Allow me .
- Your Highness , you are so kind to me .
It was so nice of you to come up .
Give me a drink , quick .
Now we 'll have to get those pearls .
Come in .
So it was you !
Say , what was the idea of taking my car and ...
Hello .
May I ask what this is all about ?
This is my uncle , Prince Margoli .
Bradley 's my name .
- Are you insinuating that my niece ...
- Yes , I am .
She stole my car .
That 's not true .
Are you calling me a liar ?
I say that could not be true .
Uncle , it is true .
Then you really did what the police and what this young man accuse you of doing ?
- Yes .
But let me explain .
- There is no explanation .
There 's got to be an explanation .
That car didn 't even belong to me , and somebody 's got to pay for it .
Let that be the least of your worries .
You 'll have the money before you leave this room .
- What interests me most is your conduct .
- No , Uncle ...
I don 't want any excuses !
This is the last of your numberless escapades .
I shall take this up at the family council , yes .
I 'll not let you drag down our family name any longer .
Do you realise what you did ?
You stole a car .
You , a de Beaupre !
- I shall see that the family disowns you .
- Now look here ...
This is a black spot on the escutcheon of the de Beaupres which will have to be wiped away .
- But after all ...
- Will you kindly let me handle this alone ?
- Now , I 'm telling you ...
- Please , sir .
Whose niece is she , your niece or my niece ?
Whose car was it , your car or my car ?
Now let me tell you , my niece is more important to me than your car .
My car is more important to me than your niece !
Well , I don 't know .
Well , look . I 'm on my vacation and I don 't want any more trouble than I had already and I certainly don 't want to start a European war .
Look pay me 35,000 francs for my car , and let 's have a drink .
I cannot treat the matter so lightly .
Madeleine , I think the behaviour of this young man is excellent and I want you to apologise .
I ask your forgiveness from the bottom of my heart .
Oh , come on .
That 's okay .
Let 's have that drink .
I 'll write you the cheque at once .
Why do you suppose she did it ?
Why ?
Wrong education !
That 's the trouble with our whole aristocracy .
Still think they 're living in the Middle Ages .
No respect for other people .
Treating everyone like subjects .
That 's what starts revolutions .
I guess you 're right .
She could start a revolution with me anytime .
Please ?
I beg your pardon .
If you won 't accept my apology , let me at least thank you for your chivalry .
It 's quite all right .
Why did you do it ?
- Do you really want to know the truth ?
- Yes .
- I was very late for a luncheon appointment .
- What ?
And I wanted to keep it , but not because of the food .
I get it .
Why did you leave me in the middle of the road ?
I 'd have been glad to drive you .
You were going slower and slower , and you know yourself why .
It 's very silly to say , but suddenly I got in the most awful panic .
I didn 't know you , we were alone there and before I knew what I was doing , I stepped on the gas .
I was really afraid .
Of what ?
Of you .
Well , there was no need of it .
I paid you a few compliments .
I told you how charming and how lovely you were and I 'd still repeat it , but I didn 't do anything .
But you intended to .
I did not .
You had it in your eye .
I didn 't know it showed .
By the way , did you make your luncheon appointment ?
Yes , but after I got here , I didn 't keep it .
You know it may seem strange , but I 've never had dinner with a Countess .
And I 'm afraid you never will .
We are leaving today .
- So am I. Are you going to Madrid , too ?
- No .
Neither am I.
You will hear the news of the day from the capitals of the world .
Paris , France .
The most sensational jewel robbery of a decade the disappearance of a two-million franc string of pearls from Duvalle and Company , the famous jewellers , still goes unsolved .
The police are believed to be closing in on the culprits .
The latest clues point to Spain as the country where they have taken refuge and the search has turned there .
- Mr. Bradley ?
- Yes ?
- Are you unpacked ?
- Yeah .
- Do you want any help ?
- No , thanks , everything 's fine .
- Do you need any suits pressed ? - No , no .
That 's not really necessary .
By the way , we 're dressing tonight .
- You 're dressing .
- Yes .
- I left my dinner coat in Paris . - That 's all right .
It doesn 't matter .
- I 'm sorry .
- Don 't worry .
- Come out as soon as you 're ready .
- Thanks .
Madeleine .
- Has he found them ?
- I don 't think so but he has no dinner jacket .
- That 's bad .
- Yes .
Let 's hope he wears that chequered coat , then I 'll slip away from dinner .
- And I 'll keep him at the table .
- Right , but if he doesn 't wear it ... Now we 'll have to be careful .
Don 't let 's arouse any suspicion .
- Have you any kind of a pearl necklace ?
- Yes , the imitation I bought in Vienna .
Good , put it on .
Mr. Bradley .
Thank you .
You know , I shouldn 't be allowed to sit down .
I look like a stevedore at a royal banquet .
Here 's to our charming guest .
And here 's to my charming host and my very lovely hostess .
You know , Mr. Bradley , I never thought I 'd like you .
I knew you would .
I grow on people .
I remember a few years ago , I met a girl that didn 't like me at first .
But I grew and grew on her until ...
What happened ?
She sued me .
I see .
You 're a kind of a Don Juan .
What a vacation .
What a country .
What is this tender sensation ?
This magical thrill that I feel ?
Although I seem to be in a dream ...
I know this moment is real ...
You 're here and I 'm here ...
With your heart and my heart ...
Awake in a dream ...
In a dream of romance and delight ...
Can it be that tonight is the night ?
You 're here and I 'm here ...
With your lips and my lips ...
Awake in a dream ...
And the stars looking down from above ...
Seem to sing , " You 're in love ...
" You 're in love "
Now I 'll walk with wings on my feet ...
Now I 'll feel that bitter is sweet ...
Other eyes may have charms ...
But my heaven will be in your arms ...
You 're here and I 'm here ...
With your heart and my heart ...
Awake in a dream ...
In a dream of romance and delight ...
Can it be that tonight ...
Is the night ?
That was beautiful , really beautiful .
Now you do something , Mr. Bradley .
Well , I can walk on my hands .
Fine .
Fine .
No , it 's much too early after dinner .
- Uncle , why don 't you show us some tricks ?
- Oh , no .
Yes , why don 't you ?
All right .
Now here 's a perfectly plain linen handkerchief .
Now watch it carefully .
Now the object of this trick is to see how big a hole we can burn in the handkerchief .
That 's great .
By the way , Mr. Bradley do you always carry your money in your nose ?
I don 't know , but I very often pay through the nose .
- Go on , do some more .
- All right , if you insist .
May I have your pearls for a moment ?
Now , Mr. Bradley , you see this pearl necklace ?
Now watch it very carefully .
Now , one , two , three !
- Where 'd they go ?
- Look in your right-hand pocket .
No , look in the right-hand pocket of your coat .
Well , how 'd they get in my pocket ?
Well , I can 't tell you that , Mr. Bradley .
- Well , I hope you 've been entertained ?
- Entertained ?
It 's a marvellous evening .
Now , Mr. Bradley , you 've had a very strenuous day ...
- And I should think you must be tired .
- Tired ?
I should say not .
I could stay up a week under these circumstances .
But you 're looking tired , isn 't he ?
Look .
You 've been very kind and I don 't want you to put yourself out too much .
You 're right .
It is getting late , and if you want to go to bed why , don 't let your European etiquette stand in the way .
If you 're tired , why , just go and lay the body down .
All right , then I 'll do my last trick of the evening and make myself disappear .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night , Mr. Bradley .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night .
Good night !
Good night .
Well , I guess this is what 's known as being alone at last .
- Madeleine ?
- I 'll be right back .
Yes ?
I 'm sorry to interrupt this serenade , but I really wish you 'd go to bed .
- Carlos , don 't be foolish .
- Don 't you be foolish .
And don 't encourage him to stay here .
We 've got to get rid of him as soon as possible .
And please , no emotional entanglements .
It 's dangerous , Madeleine , at this moment .
So go to bed at once , please .
I didn 't realise how tired I am .
I think I 'll go to bed .
Oh , come on .
Please stay a while , just a few minutes .
Please .
You know all you need is a frame now and you 'd be a masterpiece .
All I need is a nice , soft bed .
You must realise that I 've never been with anyone like you before .
It sounds funny , but I don 't seem to be able to entertain you .
I hate to be entertained .
Please don 't do it .
Well ...
Look , where I come from , I 'm not considered exactly bashful and if I were home and you were ...
Lizzie Smith , or Susie Brown , or Mary Jones ...
What would you do ?
Oh , boy , what ...
We wouldn 't be sitting here ...
Well , I 'm glad I 'm not Mary Jones or Lizzie Smith or Susie Brown .
I 'm crazy about you , Madeleine .
Madeleine .
You don 't know how I 've wanted to call you that .
Madeleine , I love you .
It 's hit me all of a sudden .
I love you .
And when you wake up , I 'm gonna take you in my arms and I 'm going to kiss you .
I 'm going to tell you that ...
Did you say something , Mr. Bradley ?
No , nothing .
Well , good night .
Calm yourself , Madeleine .
You see , it was nothing .
You 're too nervous .
Why shouldn 't I be ?
How could I help it ?
Hunted , chased every moment .
Never knowing when they 'll get us .
It 's a wonderful life , Carlos , isn 't it ?
Every time the door opens , not knowing who 's coming in .
They 'll get us , Carlos .
Sooner or later , they will .
Now , now .
Go to bed , Madeleine .
You need a good rest .
Sleep !
Who knows how many days we 've left .
Maybe tomorrow , maybe tonight .
Good night .
Good night , Madeleine .
You 're still up ?
Is anything the matter ?
Nervous .
Why should you be nervous ?
I don 't know .
I didn 't know I had a nerve in my body until tonight .
Why don 't you go to bed and get a good rest ?
I tried to , but that Spanish moon ...
You see him up there ?
Strong , isn 't it ?
It was shining right into my window .
Why don 't you draw the curtain ?
I see .
Turn off the moon , turn on the moon , just as you like .
Some people can do that easier than others .
- Aren 't you a bit hasty , Mr. Bradley ?
- Maybe I am .
I 'm sorry .
You see ...
But you wouldn 't understand , anyway .
How could you ?
This is the first vacation I 've ever had in my life and who knows if I 'll get a chance again .
A few more days and I 'll be back in Detroit and all the fun 's over .
Big chimneys , black smoke hammering noise and work , and more work .
Yet I couldn 't live without it .
I love it and I hate it .
You know , Mr. Bradley the Spanish moon is very becoming to you .
I never saw you in this light before .
- You weren 't even listening .
- Oh , yes , I was .
I heard everything you said , about yourself ...
Detroit , your work , you love it and you hate it .
Isn 't that the way you feel about me ?
Not exactly .
I ...
- I never said I love you .
- Liar .
When ?
Maybe I dreamed when I was asleep .
Yes , I must have dreamed .
Because I heard your voice saying you were crazy about me and that you loved me .
But I 'm sure you didn 't mean it .
- I mean everything I say .
- No , you don 't .
" Madeleine , I love you .
" When you wake up , I 'm going to take you in my arms and kiss you . "
Madeleine , so you weren 't asleep ?
Not quite .
Why did you let me go through all this torture ?
Why didn 't you tell me ?
I wasn 't sure if I liked you enough .
And now ?
I still don 't know .
Madeleine ?
Madeleine ?
Yes , dear ?
I have a wire from Aunt Olga .
I have to leave immediately for Madrid .
Say , wake up , Madeleine .
This is important .
A telegram from Aunt Olga .
I have to leave .
Say , what 's the matter with you ?
Where are the pearls ?
Pearis ?
The pearls , yes .
Where are they ?
Now look here .
You 're not to leave until I wire you . Understand ?
Yes , I understand .
No , you don 't .
I 'm going to take this Bradley with me .
What ?
I say , I 'm going to take this Bradley to town with me .
I 'll get rid of him there .
Mr. Bradley .
Mr. Bradley .
Mr. Bradley !
Yes , darling .
Wake up , please .
I 'm leaving for Madrid .
Goodbye .
Have a good trip .
If you 'd like to go with me , I 'll be very glad to have you .
It 's a wonderful trip .
You can see Spain .
Always wanted to see Spain .
- Ever since I was a little boy .
- Well , now 's your chance .
But I 'm not a little boy anymore .
He won 't go .
See if you can persuade him .
- We don 't want him hanging around here .
- I 'll talk to him .
Tom .
Tom !
Tom .
- Good morning , Mr. Bradley .
- Good morning , Countess .
- I hear you don 't want to leave .
- Right .
I don 't .
My uncle sent me here to persuade you to leave .
Can you be persuaded ?
No .
Thank you , darling .
- Well ?
- Carlos , he thinks you 're a wonderful man .
Well , is he going to leave ?
No .
Now , Mr. Bradley , I don 't want to be impolite , but I must insist .
Madeleine .
Yes , darling ?
Nothing .
I was just saying your name .
Madeleine .
What a lovely name .
Much nicer than Countess .
Please forget the Countess .
There is no Countess .
Just Madeleine .
And Tom .
Madeleine , do you mind if I ask you a very personal question ?
No , please , what is it ?
Are you eating those eggs ?
No .
Thank you .
You get a marvellous appetite in Spain .
What a country !
What eggs !
What 's the matter ?
Nothing .
Just looking at you .
How do I look in the sunlight ?
Bad , very bad .
As a matter of fact , so bad that I wish the moon would soon come out again .
Do you realise that you are now my prisoner ?
No car , no telephone , hours to the nearest railroad and a train only every two days .
You frighten me and we 're alone .
All by ourselves .
Two days ago , I didn 't know anything about you .
Two days ago , you didn 't even exist .
You 're wrong , I did exist , but I didn 't live .
It 's crazy , isn 't it ?
But wonderful .
A certain Mr. Bradley comes from America .
That 's all I know about you .
All I know about you is you stole my car and I 'm insane about you .
Olga ?
Hello , Madeleine .
Please .
Why did you come here ?
That 's a fine way to greet a sweet old lady .
I could be your grandmother .
And if your grandmother came here , what would you do ?
You would offer her a brandy , of course .
- Straight ?
- Please .
Brandy 's the only thing I am straight about .
You know ... I never drank until I went to gaol .
Thanks .
You know , people wouldn 't be so afraid of dying if they could take a bottle of brandy with them .
Did Carlos send you ?
Yes .
And he 's pretty sore at you .
I don 't care .
Now come on , you could have answered his wires and they really need you in Madrid .
I 've some good news for you .
We 've a great chance of selling the necklace .
I 'm afraid you have to find someone else .
I 'm not going .
Not going ?
No , I 'm through with you , and Carlos , and all the others .
I need another brandy .
There , now I 'm sober again .
Carlos told me all about the American .
Is he still here ?
That 's none of your business .
You 're quite right .
It is none of my business .
But it is my business to see that you get right back to Madrid .
Now , Madeleine , you know Carlos as well as I do .
He has a very kind soul but as his record shows , there is a very mean streak in him and he can be pretty nasty .
Very nasty .
Why didn 't you stay in the car ?
You promised to let me handle her .
Before I tell you what I plan to do with you in case you refuse allow me to compliment you .
You 're looking more beautiful than ever .
- Love must be a wonderful thing .
- It is , Carlos .
It gives you strength and courage , something to fight for .
I have something to fight for , too .
You know these pearls , don 't you ?
They feel cold when you touch them , but they 're not cold .
They 're hot .
They 're burning a hole in my pocket .
And I have to get rid of them as soon as possible .
Now look here , Carlos .
You helped me when I was in need , and you were very decent about it .
Then you asked me to get the pearls for you and I did .
Now we are even .
Mathematics isn 't my strong point .
I only know that I absolutely need you to sell those pearls .
Now go pack .
We 're leaving .
- Yes , but in different directions .
- Oh , no .
No , in the same direction .
Now , Madeleine , no matter how close you may be to this American don 't forget that you and I are closer still .
We 're strung together on the same rope of pearls .
Countess .
It was very gracious of you to elevate me to that lofty station and I hope Your Highness won 't be too insulted but I have definitely made up my mind to remove the crest from my stationery my lingerie , and my life .
- Goodbye .
- Oh , no .
- Let me go .
- Why don 't you call for help ?
Why don 't you call for your friend ?
Why don 't you ?
Why don 't you bring him here ?
Why don 't you tell him ?
It must be hard for you .
I know how you feel , Madeleine .
It really is serious , isn 't it ?
For the first time in my life .
He must be a nice young man .
Where is he ?
I 'd like to meet him .
Don 't you dare .
Why ?
Are you afraid ?
Why don 't you tell him about yourself ?
I will .
Oh , no .
You think you will , but you won 't .
The words won 't come from your tongue .
I tried it once myself , and it won 't do , my dear .
Some years ago , I was sick in a hospital in Vienna .
There was a charming doctor .
He was a fine man .
We thought a great deal of each other .
I used to dream what you are dreaming now .
Then , right in my dreams , I 'd feel a hand falling on my shoulder .
Sooner or later it falls , and I 'd hear myself saying to him :
" I must go downtown on important business .
I 'll be back soon . "
And then under my breath I 'd say , " Soon .
" 10 years . 20 years .
" Life . "
I still dream of him now and then .
I still have it .
- I didn 't spoil it .
- Stop it !
What are you going to tell him ?
I don 't know .
I 'll think of something .
We are sailing , we are sailing ...
We are sailing the 28th ... The 28th we ...
We are sailing , we are sailing ...
We are sailing the 27th ... The 27th we 're sailing ...
Tom , I just had a message from Madrid .
Well , that 's nothing .
I just got an answer from Paris .
Everything 's okay .
Oh , darling , in a few days you 'll be in Detroit .
Now I 've warned you .
Don 't want you to be disappointed later .
There 's no glamour about me .
I 'm not a king , nor a prince , nor a count .
Not even an Elk .
- Tom , I have something to tell you .
- I must tell you something .
I have a confession to make , Madeleine .
I lied to you , and I think you should know it before we get married .
I told you I make a $ 150 a week , and I only make a $ 125 .
- But , Tom , all this is not important .
I have something even more embarrassing to tell you .
I 'm not the general manager .
I 'm only the third assistant .
And my father 's not the postmaster . He 's only a mailman , so ...
You see , Madeleine , you better think it over .
What do you say ?
Well what would you say if I lied to you ?
Listen , I 'd marry you if you were a princess or a queen .
I 'm not a snob .
But you are a countess , aren 't you ?
- That doesn 't mean anything .
- It means more than you think , Tom .
I 've been thinking about it a lot .
Castles in Spain are very beautiful , but they don 't last .
They blow away and then comes reality .
Reality ?
We love each other , that 's reality .
No .
It 's a dream .
We come from different worlds .
There 's a wall , a high wall between us .
There 's no use fooling ourselves .
I just had a message from Madrid that brought me down to earth .
I see .
But let 's be grateful .
We had a gorgeous week together , seven heavenly days .
Seven dreams , a beautiful adventure .
Adventure ?
I see .
Turn on the moon , turn off the moon .
Don 't leave me like this , Tom .
These are our last moments together , the way we 'll always remember each other .
That 's all right .
I told you to think it over and you did .
I can 't blame you .
You 're right .
I can 't buy you any diamond clips or pearl necklaces .
Pearl necklace !
It is a pearl necklace that is separating us .
Well , it 's too bad , but I couldn 't buy you any real pearls .
And when it comes to jewellery , I 'm sure you like the real thing .
Tom , I swore I wouldn 't tell you but I can 't let you go away thinking I 'm something even worse than I am .
You heard about the big theft in Paris , the pearl necklace .
I did it .
I fooled you , I lied to you .
There 's only one true thing you know about me .
I did love you .
I do love you .
Goodbye , Tom .
I hope she 's got rid of him by now .
You know , I almost left without saying goodbye , Your Highness .
I wouldn 't like it known in European courts that Americans have no manners .
Goodbye .
I 've invited Mr. Bradley to stay for dinner .
I really think it 's an imposition , but since you insist , well , I 'll stay and try to be very entertaining .
I 'm a little bit worried , Mr. Bradley .
If you stay to dinner , I 'm afraid you 'll miss your train .
That 's the kind of hospitality I like .
Shall we join the ladies ?
Mr. Bradley , the truth is ...
Now I 'm sure you 'll understand but we have some very serious family business to discuss .
That 's all right , just consider me one of the family .
After you , Uncle Carlos .
You know , this is sort of a farewell dinner , and I think we ought to have a toast .
Just what would you suggest ?
First , I want to drink to my hostess who first stole my car and then stole my heart .
My car was insured , but my heart wasn 't .
And then I think we ought to drink to Aunt Olga .
Because I understand she 's been ill .
I ?
Yes , I heard you were very ill , about 35 years ago in Vienna .
You made a mistake , Aunt Olga .
You should have told that doctor .
And if he had really loved you , he would have helped you over that wall .
I 'm sure it would have been a great shock to him when he heard about it .
He probably would have called you every name under the sun .
He probably would have taken you over his knee and given you the spanking of your life .
- Does it still hurt , darling ?
- Just a little .
Don 't worry .
He would have slapped your hands so hard that they 'd never dream again of touching anything that didn 't belong to them .
I 'm sorry , honey .
They 're still a little red .
But he 'd have stuck by you if he really loved you .
He would have seen that you got your chance .
And if anybody tries to stop you from getting that chance , I 'd like to see him !
How about some sauce hollandaise ?
It goes very well with a fricassee of chicken .
Tell me , Your Highness you 're a man of great experience , you usually know what 's coming next .
Do you think there 's going to be a war ?
I hope not .
I 'm always in favour of peace .
But as the situation is at the moment , with nobody minding his own business you never can tell what may happen .
Tell me , Tom what would America 's attitude be if it really came to a crisis ?
If America is wise , it won 't ever mix in European affairs .
But sometimes we get dragged in , and then , of course , we have to go through with it .
You can 't underestimate America .
That would be a foolish thing to do .
It 's a big country .
Six feet three .
How about some more sauce hollandaise ?
You know , Your Highness ... I was just thinking of some parlour tricks you once showed me .
They were awfully good but I think I can show you one that 'll top anything you 've ever seen .
You see this chicken ?
Now watch closely .
One , two , three , presto .
It 's gone .
Where is it ?
In my stomach ?
That 's what you think .
It isn 't .
It 's in the inside pocket of your coat and it isn 't chicken anymore .
It 's changed into a string of pearls .
You know , that 's marvellous .
I can scarcely believe it .
But you 're right .
It is in my inside pocket .
But it didn 't change into a string of pearls , it changed into this .
You see , Mr. Bradley , it 's a better trick than even you thought .
- Carlos .
- Don 't worry , darling .
He won 't shoot me .
There are too many witnesses around .
Besides , hanging is a very painful death .
I really hope you don 't shoot him unless it 's absolutely necessary .
Now , Mr. Bradley , I 'm going to lock you in a nice , cool cellar for two or three days where you 'll have a chance to think about life and Bronson 8 .
In other words , I 'm giving you back to the automobile business .
Pedro !
Yes , sir .
Take the plate to the kitchen and disarm the fricassee .
Now , Mr. Whatever-your-name-is , I want that pearl necklace .
Well , you won 't get it .
All right , I 'll go into my final trick of the evening .
See this hand ?
Now it 's a fist .
The fist is still in my hand and when I count three the fist will be on your jaw .
One , two ...
A lady to see you , M. Duvalle .
Will you excuse me , please ?
Yes , madame , what can I ...
How do you do , M. Duvalle ?
May I introduce my fiancé , Mr. Bradley ?
Glad to meet you , M. Duvalle .
I 've heard so much about you , it 's just like meeting an old friend .
We came to see you about the pearl necklace .
Pearl necklace ?
Do you intend to buy another one ?
On the contrary .
You see , the necklace that you sold mademoiselle is really very beautiful but too expensive for us , and I 'm afraid we 'll have to return it .
- You have it with you , dear ?
- Yes , darling .
Would it upset you too much if I would ask you to take it back ?
I hate to return things , it 's not my habit .
But you said you would take it back whenever I changed my mind and I have changed my mind .
As a matter of fact , I 've changed my life .
I 'm marrying Mr. Bradley soon .
That is , I hope so .
I know my fiancée is indebted to you and even to France and if you can see your way to help us to release mademoiselle from her obligation , it 'll be swell .
Otherwise , I 'm afraid we 'll have to postpone our marriage a long while .
Seven years .
Seven long years , M. Duvalle .
Dr. Pauquet on the telephone , M. Duvalle .
Hello , Dr. Pauquet ?
M. Duvalle ?
I had a pretty bad night but suddenly I feel like a new man .
In fact , I feel like 2,200,000 francs .
That 's bad , definitely bad !
No , no , there 's nothing the matter with me .
I 'll be around this afternoon and tell you all about it .
Now , about this necklace .
- I will take it back .
- Thank you .
A thousand thanks , monsieur .
And be assured , M. Duvalle , that when I 'm in America ... I 'll recommend you to all my friends .
Please don 't .
But to return to your obligation as far as I am concerned , it is paid for and forgotten .
Thank you .
But your debt to the state , that is a different matter .
I will do everything I can to help you but the final decision is entirely up to the authorities .
- Did you want to get married today ?
- Yes , sir .
- Have you a licence ?
- Sure .
That 's not your marriage licence .
Why , yes , it is .
I ...
It 's your parole .
- The witnesses are here ?
- Yes , sir .
Gentlemen , if you please .
Turn off your motor .
Hold the light up in those trees .
We 'll get them before they leave the island .
- Lavond , my friend , will we make it ?
- Yes .
The dogs lost our scent when we crossed that river .
Come on .
Yes , I 've work to do .
I 've dreamt only of my work .
Well , my work is no dream .
I 've been awake for 17 years .
But you have only hatred in your heart .
My work will help the world to live .
My work will help three men die .
What is it , Prince ?
What 're you trying to tell me ? What 's wrong ?
Lachna .
Go away . Go away , Prince .
Lachna , Lachna , see what 's wrong with the dogs .
It 's Marcel , my husband !
Call off the dogs , Lachna . Call off the dogs , quickly !
Come here , Prince .
Quickly !
Go to the shed . Go to the shed .
- Here .
Help me . - We 're safe .
Easy now .
Easy , old friend . Come along .
Marcel .
- Marcel , my husband .
- Malita .
So you 've come .
How did you get here ?
Did they pardon you ?
- We escaped .
- But the police . They 'll be following you .
No .
They lost our trail , weeks ago .
Come , let 's get inside .
Malita , I knew you 'd come here as we planned .
I knew you 'd be waiting .
Oh , Marcel .
Marcel .
You 've been working .
I knew it by the howling of the dogs .
But you 've failed , you 've failed again .
I can see it in your face .
Now , now , don 't excite yourself , Marcel .
He 's weak , madame .
- He 's been ill a long time .
- Who is he ? Is he ...
I know our mistake now .
It came to me one night in that cesspool of stupid minds .
- Marcel .
Marcel .
- No more failures , Malita .
The next one will have a perfect brain .
Marcel .
But we 're not alone .
Oh , Paul .
- Malita , this is my friend , Paul Lavond .
- Madame .
We escaped together .
- He saved my life more than once .
- I am grateful , monsieur .
We need have no secrets from him .
Now , Malita , where are they ?
- I 've thought , I 've planned so long .
- They 're in the next room .
Malita , help me . Help me .
Malita , shut off the tanks .
No .
No .
No .
Malita , some of the others , quick .
Careful .
Careful , Marcel , you might hurt them .
No .
Just as I thought .
They 're all alike .
They might as well not have any brain at all !
What is it ?
Is this the great work you 've been dreaming of so long ?
Toy dogs ? Toy ?
Forgive me , Lavond .
Why , it feels warm .
Almost flesh and bone .
- Like the real animal .
- It is .
Eight hours ago it was a full-grown Saint Bernard .
You think I 'm mad .
The world would think so , too , if they knew what I was going to do .
Lavond , my friend , millions of years ago the creatures that roamed this world were gigantic .
As they multiplied , the earth could no longer produce enough food .
Think of it , Lavond , every living creature reduced to one-sixth its size , one-sixth its physical need !
Food for six times all of us !
Lavond , you know that all matter is composed of atoms ?
- Yes , yes , of course , I know .
- And all atoms are made of electrons .
- Yes , I know .
- Well , I 've found a way to reduce all atoms in a body simultaneously to any desired degree and still maintain life , as in this little dog .
Well , then , the dog should be alive .
It is !
It is . Only , in reducing the brain , all records are wiped off , no memory left , no will of its own .
A creature capable of responding only to the force of another will .
Malita , place it on the table .
Now , watch .
Malita , a piece of bread .
Lavond , watch the others .
Watch them .
See , Lavond , only a few crumbs is all they need .
Napoleon , Napoleon .
Get down . Get down .
Get down .
That 's a nice dog .
See , Paul ?
See ?
Look ! Look , look , the little ones are falling down .
Naturally , I stopped concentrating .
- I broke the beam of thought .
- No man can do this .
But I did .
You saw me do it .
But tonight , my friend , I 'll show you a complete success .
A little dog this high , but perfect with an active brain .
- Malita , get the big dog .
- No , no , Marcel , not now .
- Rest .
- Rest ?
How can I rest ?
I tell you ...
Oh , you 've done enough tonight .
Have you any brandy ?
- Yes .
- Come along .
Lachna , get some brandy , quick . Quick .
Prince , Prince , go upstairs . Go .
Brandy , brandy , you moron .
Now some hot broth . Hot broth !
What use are you ? Go !
Malita , where did you get her ?
In a Berlin slum .
She 's an inbred peasant half-wit , but I wanted no prying wits about me .
Did anyone know she came with you ?
No , Marcel , no one knows .
A friend of Marcel 's is a welcome guest .
I hope you can stay with us a long time .
You 'll be safe here .
And you can help us with our work .
Oh , thank you very much , madame , but I 'm afraid that 'll be impossible .
I have work to attend to myself .
You see , when a man saves an ambition in a dirty dungeon for 17 years , it becomes almost an insane obsessión .
Well , with Marcel it was science , with me it was hate .
Hate and vengeance .
I may not look it , madame , but I was once a very successful banker .
Three men , my partners , lied and tricked me into prison .
Well , three lives are going to pay for it .
Well , now you know why I can 't take advantage of your hospitality .
I 'm leaving for Paris and tomorrow .
- Malita .
- Yes , Marcel . I 'm coming .
Madame .
Marcel , please , that 's all you can do now .
You must sleep .
No .
No , I must see it through , every detail .
You 've corrected her brain , Marcel .
She 's no longer the stupid half-wit .
She 's going to be beautiful .
That 's it , Lachna .
Straighten out .
Malita , turn on the tanks .
Wait !
This is wrong .
Why ?
She 'll be perfect .
Perfection isn 't wrong .
Think of it , Lavond .
A human being so high with a perfect brain .
Malita , the mist .
Lavond , tonight , out of this mist , you will see the birth of a new mankind , in full control of its destiny .
In just a few seconds , Lavond , just a few seconds , she 'll awaken .
Marcel .
Marcel !
Marcel .
Marcel . Speak to me !
Marcel !
Marcel , he 's dead .
Poor tortured brain .
Perhaps it 's all for the best , Malita .
But our work , our work , we must carry on !
- But this is murder . - No , no .
No , she 's not dead .
You must help me .
Marcel would want you to .
You must stay here .
Quick , quick , help me .
Some cotton . Cotton .
Now , you concentrate .
She will respond to your will .
It 's like some horrible dream .
I don 't want any part of this .
- Restore her to what she was .
- No .
She will always remain small , small .
We can make the whole world small as Marcel wanted to do .
We can go to Paris .
There are many people there .
There 's where we begin our work .
Yes , Malita .
- Yes ?
- Matin .
- Are you busy ?
- Yes , very busy .
Well , this is more important than anything else .
- Come in right away .
- Oh , all right .
Radin , this is terrible .
Well , what 's wrong now ?
Indigestion ?
If you continue to crucify your stomach , my dear Coulvet , you 'II ...
Listen to this . " In a sensational statement by the Prefect of Police today ,
" it was admitted that Paul Lavond , former bank president ,
" convicted of looting his own bank and killing a watchman ,
" escaped from prison four months ago .
" He had served 17 years of a life sentence .
" Police censorship had withheld the news until ... "
Well , what about it ?
It was a pretty plot , Charles , but I knew we 'd never get away with it .
Victor , not so loud .
- Don 't shout it all over the bank .
- No , please .
After all , embezzlement and murder are things we should keep to ourselves .
But you didn 't have to kill that man , Emile .
Stop it !
- Keep your mouth closed .
- He 'll come back to Paris , he 'll talk .
You cringe and scream like a woman , Victor .
No , my friends , our former president may be honest , but he 'll never be so stupid as to set foot again in France .
I 'd sleep better if I knew Lavond was back in prison .
A 50,000 franc reward would ensure that .
There 's a certain amusing irony in offering a man 's own money for his capture .
50,000 francs ?
Why not ?
Give me the Prefect of Police .
Instruct all divisions to restudy the features of Paul Lavond from the photograph issued , and impress upon them it was taken 17 years ago .
My partners and I will increase the reward to 100,000 francs .
- Malita .
- Yes , I 'm coming , madam .
- Bring the ...
Oh , I see you have it .
- Yes , I have the bundle .
Come into the back room with me .
Look in the basket , Malita .
100,000 francs reward for my capture .
Who do you think is offering all this money for me ?
The same three swine that sent me to prison before .
They 're frightened to death , Malita .
They know that my freedom means they 're finished .
But what they don 't know is the Paul Lavond they 're looking for is Madame Mandilip , a poor , tottering old woman .
Yes . Very nice .
Beautifully constructed .
But , madame , the bank would not be interested in financing the manufacture of toys .
But , monsieur , I thought that possibly if not the bank , that you personally might do it .
No , there are so many novelties like this on the market now .
But a toy like this has never been made before .
It 's not mechanical and yet , if you speak to it , it will obey you .
- Obey ?
- Yes .
Ask it to do something .
- Do something ?
- Yes . Give it an order .
Get up on your feet .
Walk around .
Faster .
Faster !
That 's amazing !
It didn 't move like a mechanical toy .
How do you do that , madame ?
That 's my little secret , monsieur .
What capital would you require ?
To start with , just a few thousand francs .
Well , I 'll think it over .
Get in touch with me later .
But , monsieur , I want to start manufacturing at once .
The Christmas holidays are so close .
Naturally , madame , I shall have to investigate further before I advance any money .
Of course . Of course .
I 'd expect you to come to my shop and go into every detail .
- When could you come ?
- How about tonight ?
- Say , 8 : 00 ?
- Splendid .
My little shop is in Montmartre .
It 's rather difficult to find .
I 'll meet you by the Moulin Rouge at 8 : 00 .
Good day , monsieur .
But remember , I 'm making no promises .
You don 't have to .
Once you 're in my shop , I 'll wager you 'll do anything I ask .
Well , I can hardly believe it .
I feel like pinching myself to see if I 'm awake or dreaming .
To think that I really have you here .
I mean , that you 're going to be my partner and help me .
Yes , but remember if I do , it 'll only be financially .
- My name must not appear .
- I wouldn 't dream of using your name .
You 'll just be my silent partner .
My workshop is downstairs .
Follow me .
Be careful .
It 's very steep .
Now , this is the room where we keep all our little secrets .
Make yourself comfortable , monsieur .
May I take your coat ?
No , no , no , it isn 't necessary . I 'll just keep it on .
Please be seated .
- Malita .
- Yes , madame .
Come here , please .
This is Monsieur Radin , the banker I spoke to you about .
- This is Madame Malita , my assistant .
- Monsieur .
Is everything ready for Monsieur Radin ?
- Yes , madame .
- Splendid . Splendid .
Some cognac .
Sit down . Sit down , monsieur .
Excuse me .
- No cognac , please .
- No cognac ?
No , thank you .
- Won 't you have some cognac , monsieur ?
- No , no , thank you .
Here 's another of our little pets .
Most ingenious .
- It is lifelike , isn 't it ?
- Isn 't it though ?
But , monsieur , you see that little doll sitting over there on the block ?
That 's Lachna , our apache doll .
Malita , will you please bring me the little stiletto ?
All our accessories are carried out down to the most minute detail .
For example , on our ponies , the harness is exact .
And on our little dogs , the collars are all different , but mind you , suitable to the breed .
Thank you , Malita .
And our apache dolls we supply with a dinky little stiletto .
Why , this is an authentic little replica itself .
Isn 't it ?
Isn 't it ?
Don 't be too alarmed , Radin .
You 're not dying .
Oh , I see you recognize my voice .
That 's one of the few things that you and Coulvet and Matin didn 't steal from me .
Another is my hatred .
Look at me and see what 17 years in the grave has done to me .
No , Radin , without my hatred , I never could have lived to exhume myself .
What swine you three are .
You 're going to help me to recover what I can from life .
That 's why you 're not going to die .
No , I wouldn 't let you die for the world , Radin .
The police .
One moment , monsieur . Madame will be with you .
We must finish painting those soldiers of the legion , Malita .
And we have 10 dolls to dress .
- Good evening , monsieur .
- Good evening , madame .
- Can I show you something special ?
- No , thank you .
But your glue pots in the alley , the neighbors are complaining again .
I 'm so sorry , of course .
How stupid of me .
But the holiday rush , monsieur , I quite forgot .
I assure you I shall hang them inside .
- Fine . Do so .
- I will , monsieur .
Well , good day and good luck , madame .
I 'm amazed at my good luck , monsieur .
Amazed is the word , eh , Malita ?
Stupid policeman , to let an old white wig cost him 100,000 francs .
It might have been safer to take him downstairs and make him small .
He 's small already in mind .
In fact , Malita , if most men were reduced to the dimensions of their mentality ,
Marcel 's plan wouldn 't be necessary .
But we 're pledged to it , aren 't we ?
We have sworn .
Calm yourself , Malita .
Let me make the plans .
Where are you going ?
To your mother 's again where the police are always watching ?
No . I 'm going to see my daughter .
It 's the one thrill life has left me .
I love to look at her , to listen to her talk .
It drives me almost crazy though , Malita , not to be able to take her in my arms and tell her who I am .
Why don 't you bring the little girl here ?
Why , I couldn 't tell her who I am .
Why , she 's grown to hate her father 's memory . I ...
I 'll not be long , Malita .
It 's 5 : 00 .
How many more pieces have you got ?
- Three or four .
- Well , hurry up .
It 's amazing the way you washed-out Cinderellas can speed up work when 5 : 00 comes around .
Are we whacking shirts on the shore of a stream ?
Look at this water , too much soap .
All my profits .
Maizie , come here .
What 's that dream on your face ?
A rendezvous with that scoundrel of yours I suppose ?
Well , you 'll catch this fish first and these along with it since you 're so stored up for bait .
Oh , good evening .
Lorraine , take care of the customer .
- Good evening , madame .
- Good evening , my dear .
Why , you seem very tired .
Oh , no . I was just rushing to finish my tub on time .
How soon do you want this ?
Tomorrow ?
No , no , my dear .
The end of the week will be plenty of time .
Oh , fine .
One skirt . Three blouses .
Your hands seem chapped .
You should put lotion on them .
I know one of the very finest ...
Toto has a new taxi .
- Mademoiselle Lavond , I believe .
- Yes , Toto ?
I bring you the honor of driving home in the Fortuna Taxi Company 's third vehicle on which I have just paid the first installment .
- Is the second paid for yet ?
- An insidious detail .
We capitalists must take risks .
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
- Right , Madame Mandilip ?
- Absolutely .
You see , Madame Mandilip understands economics .
Oh , here you are , my pet .
Give this number to your suitors .
Reliable service day and night .
No rear sight mirrors , free parking time in the Bois .
I hear your grandmother is ill , my dear .
I should so like to pay a call on her .
Oh , it 's just the weather , I think .
It 's been so cold and damp .
Yes .
I feel quite ashamed of myself for not having called before , but I 've been so busy getting my shop ready .
Well , I must be going now .
Good day , my dear .
- Goodbye , madame .
- Good day .
Here you are , madame .
It 's nice to know a reliable firm when you need a taxi .
Yes , indeed .
And thanks .
You have my best wishes in your new venture .
Thanks , and the same to you .
Never overlook a chance to improve business . That 's my motto .
- What 's the matter ?
- That woman .
- Madame Mandilip ?
- Yes . She 's somehow pathetic and kind .
She almost makes me want to cry .
Look , I feel just the opposite from that right now .
Will you be the first fare in my third taxi ?
I 'd love to .
If you 'll give me just three minutes to finish my tub .
In three minutes , Dame Fortune the Third will be at your service .
All right .
- Do you like her ?
- Oh , she 's lovely .
Get inside , mademoiselle .
Do we have to go up in the tower to talk ?
Was love ever so humiliated ?
Here I am taking you up near heaven where all angels belong
- and you protest . - Toto .
Watch your hats .
Going down !
Toto , really , why did you bring me up here ?
Don 't you remember ?
This is where I first gave you complete ownership of myself and a half interest in the Fortuna Taxi Company .
- There was only one taxi then , remember ?
- Yes . It was April and we could smell the chestnut blossoms all the way from the Bois .
It was so ...
I told you then how I felt about things and that you shouldn 't waste your time on me .
It 's grand to be up here when your thoughts are all jumbled .
Don 't things look different ?
Everything seems so small and unimportant from up here .
But I don 't live up here .
I live down there .
Our world 's what we make it , Lorraine .
You know , you 're not making the best of yours .
- I make it as I see it .
- Yes , I know .
But you 're too sensitive .
It hasn 't been pleasant , Toto , to be pointed at , singled out , despised as the daughter of a ...
It does something to you when you 're very young .
Something that grows up with you .
It got so that I hated to go to school .
- Hated even to ... To leave the house .
- Yes .
Kids can be pretty brutal , can 't they ?
And now since the escape , it 's started all over again .
Pictures in the paper , our movements watched , people whispering .
Oh , don 't let that get you , darling .
You 're above all that .
- Do you wonder that I hate him ?
- Don 't hate , Lorraine .
Oh , not for what he 's done to me , but to my mother .
The mental torture , the poverty he brought her .
Toto , I think I should tell you the truth .
My mother didn 't just die .
- She killed herself .
- Yes . I know .
And even that doesn 't make any difference ?
Nothing could make any difference .
But , Toto , I could never escape from the fact that I 'm his daughter .
I could never ask any man to share that with me .
Least of all you .
I love you too much .
Toto , we 'd better go .
You might as well kill a person as frighten them to death .
The frosty weather hasn 't done your flowers any good , has it ?
Those violets are rather pretty .
How much are they ?
One franc , madame .
They 're unusually large this season .
Yes . I 'll take a bunch .
- Thank you , madame . - Madame .
Come , come .
Move on . No loitering .
I 'm watching Lavond 's mother 's place .
We 're certain he 's in Paris .
Yes ?
Come in .
Lorraine ?
- It 's all right , Mother .
- Paul .
Much as I love you , you mustn 't come here anymore .
Ever since that first night , I 've been terrified that someone would suspect .
But there 's no reason why Madame Mandilip shouldn 't come and visit you .
Come along , Mother .
Sit down . Don 't worry .
You shouldn 't come so late , Paul .
Lorraine will be home from work any minute .
That 's just why I 'm here .
As a matter of fact , she knows I 'm coming .
You 've been talking to her ?
Yes .
I saw her today in that filthy laundry she 's working in .
But you didn 't tell her ? You didn 't let her know who you were ?
No . Not yet .
But I 'm going to tonight .
I can 't stand it any longer .
But she 's so bitter , so resentful .
I know .
Poor child .
But we can 't blame her for that .
Those three swine .
Paul , listen to me .
If you must tell her , let me talk to her first , slowly , gradually .
- It 's so dangerous , Paul . - Yes , I know , Mother .
- Grandmother .
- It 's Lorraine .
Be careful .
Grandmother !
Why , what 's ...
Oh , it 's you .
I thought something had happened to Grandmother .
I 'm so sorry .
I 'm used to locking my shop .
It was stupid of me .
I 'm so glad .
Come on and sit down .
- Are you enjoying yourself , darling ?
- Yes , dear . We 've had a delightful little chat .
Oh , how lovely .
Oh , that 's sweet of you .
Violets are Grandmother 's favorite flower .
- Violets ?
- Why , yes .
I remember Mother telling how ...
I 'll put them in water later .
- What 's the matter , darling ?
You cold ? - Just a little chilly .
Well , we 'll have a blaze in just a moment .
Not much firewood for a franc nowadays , is there ?
Aren 't prices awful ?
My yard 's just littered with packing cases .
- You must let me send you some .
- Oh , no , we couldn 't .
Well , why not ?
I have to pay to have it carted away .
Well , in that case , we 'd be very grateful .
What a beautiful woman .
Yes .
That was my mother .
- This is a lovely rosary .
- It 's mine .
Yes , I know .
I mean ...
I knew it must be .
I gave my little girl one just like it .
She was so proud of it .
They tell me I was , too , when I got it .
Something happen to change your feelings toward it ?
Please , Madame Mandilip .
I 'm sure you know who we are and all about us .
The rosary was given to me by someone whose name we never mention here .
- Your father .
- I have no father .
You 're very young to be so bitter .
- Don 't blame me . Blame him .
- Lorraine , your father was innocent .
Yes , that 's what I 've heard all my life .
That 's why they sent him to prison .
That 's why my mother killed herself !
And that 's why his mother spends her old age this way , with barely enough food , and firewood once a week a luxury !
Please , please .
And do you know how we get these great comforts ?
Not from my work in the laundry .
That wouldn 't keep us alive .
No .
All our great wealth comes from the Café Poule down the street where I 've the honor to work at night .
Where I have the joy of letting a crowd of sewer workers smirk at me so they can buy more wine !
A centime a drink I get !
Lorraine .
It doesn 't sound pretty , does it ?
Well , it isn 't !
And Toto 's eyes weren 't nice to look at when he held out his heart to me and I had to throw it back in his face !
That 's what my father 's done and I loathe him for it !
See who that is , please .
- I wish to speak to Madame Lavond . - Monsieur .
I 'm from the Prefect of Police , madame .
We are still looking for your son .
Have you heard from him ?
Madame Lavond was just speaking of her boy .
His escape has naturally quite unnerved her .
- Naturally .
- But I 've not heard from him .
- Not even by letter , monsieur .
- Lf you do , madame , the Prefect will expect you to notify him at once .
In the meantime , I 'll check with you each day .
You understand , of course , harboring a criminal , even though it be your son , is a most serious offense .
You don 't need to remind us of our duty or of the law .
Good day , monsieur .
Good day , mademoiselle .
Madame .
I know how you feel , my dear . But don 't blame them .
It 's only natural for them to expect him to come here .
He hasn 't seen you for so long .
You must be prepared though .
He may come .
I hope he doesn 't .
Because if he does , I 'm going to turn him over to the police .
Yes .
Well , goodbye , my dear .
Yes . Yes . I know , Inspector .
But it 's been two days since Radin disappeared .
Yes . Yes , we 'd appreciate it .
Matin ?
I know it 's Lavond .
I 'm going to ask for police protection .
The less you have to do with police , the better off we 'll be .
Get hold of your nerves before you say something you 'll be sorry for .
- Oh , you needn 't worry about me .
- I am . You 've got to get out of town .
Take a trip somewhere .
- But you know I can 't with the holidays .
- Then keep your head .
Or we 'll both be taking a trip at the expense of the government . I 'll admit .
I can 't sleep .
I keep wondering which one of us he 's going to look up next .
- Goodbye , Emile .
- Thanks for coming over .
Well , what do you want ?
Your butler is showing Madame one of my dolls , monsieur .
- Madame will see you .
- Thank you .
Look at this doll , Emile .
Isn 't it clever ?
Oh , my dear Mathilde , I 've other things on my mind besides ... And I do wish you wouldn 't ask every street peddler to ... Madame .
This is a most unusual doll , madame .
Have you any more like it ?
Only one , madame .
And unfortunately , I 've made it for another customer .
They look so lifelike .
And it feels almost human .
- What 's it made of ?
- It 's a secret process of my own , madame .
Observe the detail of the features .
See how the eyes sparkle .
The little lips look as if they were going to speak to Madame .
- How much is it ?
- 250 francs .
250 francs !
Ridiculous !
Surely not to a gentleman of Monsieur 's exalted station .
Or Madame with her exquisite jewels .
Would it be presumptuous if I asked to look at that necklace a little closer ?
- Of course not .
- Thank you .
Lovely . Very lovely .
Oh , forgive me , madame , but I do love the beautiful .
You can tell that from my workmanship .
Monsieur , allow me to explain to you about my little doll .
If you 'll examine it , you 'll see how lifelike it is .
- The hair is as natural as your own .
- All right , all right . I 'll buy it .
And now , my dear , let the woman go .
What are the squirrels going to do with all the popcorn I gave them ?
Why , they 're going to keep it for the winter .
Aren 't they going to give the birdies any ?
No , they 're going to keep it all for themselves .
Thank you a thousand times , monsieur .
You 'll never know how happy it makes me to leave one of my dolls in your beautiful home .
Oh , Marguerite , you would have to come in now .
It was going to be a surprise .
Good day , madame .
Good day , petite .
- Good day . - Monsieur .
- Emile ?
Emile , what 's the matter ?
- Matter ?
Why , what do you mean ?
Why , nothing 's the matter .
Emile .
Emile , what 's the matter ?
Emile ! Emile !
Gentlemen , I 'm ashamed of you .
Two crimes have been committed right under your very noses .
Radin has disappeared , Coulvet has been paralyzed .
Both these crimes point to the vengeance of this escaped convict , Lavond .
And you , my best men , can 't offer me a single clue as to his whereabouts .
Have you lost your wits ?
And you , Maurice , what 's happened to you in this case ?
If you don 't want the reward offered for this criminal , at least spare me this humiliation .
Gentlemen , I want Paul Lavond under arrest within 24 hours .
Find him !
" Police are baffled by what they consider
" a look of constant terror in Monsieur Coulvet 's expressión . "
There , Malita , is my proud friend , Coulvet .
Taking up my sentence where I left off .
Congratulations , Lachna .
Splendid work .
I couldn 't have done better myself .
Beautiful Green Sea Emerald .
Well , little by little , I 'll get you all back .
Leave her alone !
You fool !
Why , you could have killed her .
You might have broken her neck .
Poor little thing .
I 'm coming . I 'll be right there .
Shut off the music box . Clear off the table .
I 'm sorry , monsieur .
I was in the rear of my shop .
- Shall we go upstairs ?
- This 'll do .
- Are you Madame Mandilip ?
- Yes . - I 'm from the police .
- Police ?
Oh , come in , monsieur .
- Won 't you be seated , monsieur ?
- No , thanks .
We understand that you sold a doll to Monsieur Coulvet yesterday .
Coulvet ?
Oh , yes , the gentleman whose picture 's here in the paper .
Such a shocking affair .
We 've just been reading about it .
Such a charming gentleman , so courteous .
Madame Coulvet was wearing a necklace that you admired .
Yes . I did .
It was so beautiful , no one could help looking at it .
It contained the Green Sea Emerald , one of the most famous stones in France .
You undoubtedly noticed it .
Oh , now I see . I see what you mean .
You think I had something to do with the robbery .
- Now , madame ...
- You suspect me !
Madame , don 't excite yourself .
In a case like this , we have to suspect everybody .
That is until they can prove their innocence .
All right .
I 'll go along with you .
I 'll answer any questions you want me to .
I 'll get my coat .
- You 'll have no trouble with me .
- Madame , compose yourself .
You 're taking too much for granted .
I 'm not going to arrest you .
I haven 't anything to arrest you for yet .
All I want is to ask you a few questions .
Oh , dear , an old woman like me mixed up in such a thing .
What will the neighbors say ?
The gossip .
I 'll lose all my customers .
Why , you might as well accuse one of my little dolls as accuse me .
Well , I hardly think we 'd go as far as that .
Well , this is a beautiful thing .
Surely you don 't make them yourself ?
Oh , yes , yes , everything in the shop we make ...
Oh , please , don 't touch the eyes .
They 're not dry .
It 's something new we 've been working on .
A doll with tears in its eyes .
It 's an amusing idea for the lady 's boudoir .
You see what I mean ?
No .
Well , the tears remind the husband or lover that when they 're away milady is Ionesome .
Well , that 's something new .
You see , you men never know what 's going on behind your backs .
Well , you see , I ...
It 's cute .
I haven 't seen one of these in years .
Oh , I see .
The head .
Oh , careful , monsieur .
You 'll get paint on your fingers .
- No , it 's all right . It 's dry .
- Oh , so it is .
Malita , how many times have I told you to fill these to the brim ?
We put candy in them .
What are you trying to do , cheat the children ?
- Have you any children , monsieur ?
- Yes . Well , you must let me wrap one of these up and take it home .
It isn 't necessary .
- She 'll be just as pleased as it is .
- She ?
A little girl ?
Oh , she 'll like this much better .
The clowns are for little boys .
You know , I always thought policemen were terrible men that went around with pistols in their pockets , always ready to drag a body off to prison .
When you first started questioning me , I was frightened to death .
But you 've been so kind to me , I 'm sorry I haven 't been able to help you more .
Maybe you can at that .
We may want you to come down for the investigation .
As long as my shop is here , you 'll always know where to find me .
That 's fine .
My dear Matin , you 'll be going to that hospital yourself tomorrow if you don 't go home and get some sleep .
Sleep .
Do you think I can close my eyes after seeing poor Emile ?
Doctor , what could have frightened him so ?
- What could he have seen ?
- He 'll never be able to tell us .
He 'll be hopelessly paralyzed for the rest of his life .
A brilliant mind imprisoned in a useless body .
- Imprisoned ...
- Pardon , messieurs .
- Mistletoe fresh from the market .
- No , no , go away .
What 's this ?
- Where did this come from ?
- I don 't know , monsieur .
Don 't lie .
But I assure you , monsieur , I did not put it there .
What is it , Charles ?
Operator , get me the Prefect of Police .
They 've got enough of us guarding this place .
Yes , there 's three up in the room with him now .
You may retire if you wish , monsieur .
- I assure you , you have nothing to fear .
- Retire ? - All the entrances are covered . - Very well .
- What was that ?
- See what that was .
Butler , what was that noise down there ?
An ornament fell off the Christmas tree .
You wouldn 't think a little thing like that ...
- An ornament fell off .
- We heard him . - Sounded just like glass breaking . - Yes , yes .
Relieve Pierre and have him check up on the men outside .
Very good .
Red jack on the black queen .
Do you have to whistle that way ?
- No , sir .
- Then stop it .
You mustn 't let your nerves get the better of you , Monsieur Matin .
They won 't , if I can have a little cooperation from our musically inclined friend .
Pierre .
Don 't forget the reception room at the end of the hall .
We have two men in there now .
- Well , you better check up on them . - Okay .
I wouldn 't get too upset about that note , Monsieur Matin .
Probably not for you at all .
Just some religious fanatic .
- The city 's full of them around Christmas .
- Thanks .
That 's very consoling .
That 's why the Prefect sent all you men to guard the house .
- There 's nothing to worry about .
- Perhaps not for you .
- There 's something in this house .
- Oh , nothing could get by my men .
No ?
If the other men around the house are watching as hard as these two ...
You better watch your nerves , monsieur .
I don 't think you realize the importance of ...
- Do you have to open that door ? - I 'll be right here .
If only your men would ...
Oh , what 's the use ?
Two minutes .
- I can 't stand much more of this .
- Why don 't you sit down , monsieur ?
- Please , if you don 't mind .
What shall I do ?
What should I do ?
There 's nothing for you to do .
- In a few seconds it 'll all be over .
- Yes .
A few seconds . A few seconds .
Lavond , wherever you are , in heaven 's name , listen and have mercy .
I 'll confess .
You 're innocent .
We were the guilty ones .
I 've waited a long time to read that , Malita .
Paul Lavond is vindicated .
Think of it . After 17 years of shadows , I 'm innocent .
Thanks to you , Malita .
And thanks to you , Madame Mandilip .
This is wonderful , Lavond .
Now that you are free , we can go on with our work without being bothered by the police .
No , Malita , my work is over , but I am not free .
Why , if they ever found out who I was , the police would want a lot of questions answered .
What happened to Radin ?
Who paralyzed Coulvet ?
No , Malita . When I proved my innocence , I condemned myself forever .
We must get out of here .
But before we go , we must destroy everything in the back room .
No , no ! The ghost of Marcel will curse you forever if you do .
We 've got to go on , Lavond .
We 've got to carry out his plan .
Now listen to me , Malita , and try to understand .
I never had any plans beyond the vindication of my name , and I only wanted that because of my family .
Through Marcel 's wild schemes , I was able to do it .
But we can 't go on .
Why , our work is hideous .
We 're cruel and it 's got to come to an end tonight .
No , Lavond .
You can 't do this .
I won 't let you betray Marcel .
If you go away , I will carry out his work alone .
Do you understand that ?
You fool .
Do you want to go to prison ?
As Madame Mandilip , I mailed a full confessión to the police .
But we can 't stop now !
There is so much left for us to do .
There 's nothing left for me to do , Malita .
The name of Lavond is cleared .
My mother and daughter will find nothing to be ashamed of .
I 'm sorry , Malita , I didn 't mean to speak harshly to you .
I 've plans for you .
You 'll be well taken care of .
But , please , do hurry .
Every minute counts .
Put Lachna in the basket there with Radin .
Their lives are ruined , but we can 't destroy them .
We 'll send them to the Prefect of Police .
We 've served his purpose , Radin .
Now he 'll serve ours .
Reduced to your size , I 'll control him as easily as I control you .
Now , Radin , you are going to help me .
Why , you poor insane wretch !
I shall destroy you with all the rest of this horror !
Get out of here !
Malita , put that down !
You 'll blow yourself to atoms !
And you , too , Lavond .
You 've had your vengeance .
- Now Marcel will have his .
- Malita !
Death doesn 't frighten me .
Why , it 's been part of my plan .
But not yet , Malita .
I still have something to do for my child .
When that 's done , I 'll die gladly .
Now , Malita , you don 't want to do that .
You don 't want to die , Malita .
Think of your work , think of Marcel .
Give it to me !
Malita !
Malita !
- Where 's Frank ?
- Downstairs .
Frank !
What did you find ?
Not a sign of anything .
Guess she planned to blow this place up before she mailed her confessión .
Well , that 's the end of Madame Mandilip .
We 're pretty smart , eh ?
Got everything pinned on Lavond , only to find out it 's the work of a crazy old woman . Taxi ?
Taxi ?
- Taxi .
- Yes , monsieur .
Sorry , monsieur .
Step right in , monsieur .
Aren 't you afraid of losing customers by such devotion to the newspapers ?
I 'm usually on the job , but I just happened to be interested in this story of Paul Lavond .
- Would you care to read it , monsieur ? - No , thanks , I 've read it .
- Where to , monsieur ?
- Drive anywhere you want to .
That 's a very dangerous order to give a taxi driver , monsieur .
Yes .
But you 're not an ordinary taxi driver , are you ?
Toto ?
That 's all I am now , monsieur .
But one day soon I hope ...
- How 'd you know my name was Toto ?
- Because I ...
My name is Paul Lavond .
Now , now , careful , Toto .
Don 't let me startle you .
Drive somewhere we can be alone .
- I promised to meet Lorraine at sundown .
- How is she ?
Have you seen her since the papers ?
No , monsieur , I didn 't like to talk to her about it at the laundry
- in front of all the others .
- Yes , I know , Toto .
You don 't know what your freedom means to me , Monsieur Lavond .
Yes , I do , Toto .
That 's why I 've got to talk to you , but alone .
When I want to be alone , monsieur , I always go to the tower .
It 's so far above everything and everybody .
- The Eiffel Tower , Toto ? - Yes , monsieur .
Now that I have my freedom , my exile must commence all over again .
- You can see that , can 't you ?
- I 'm trying to .
Well , at least you can understand why I can 't rejoin my family .
Yes , yes , I can see that .
But it all seems so unjust and unfair .
All you 've done , you 've done for them .
I 'm so sorry , Monsieur Lavond .
Oh , I wouldn 't be .
I 'm rather happy about it .
You can marry Lorraine . My fortune will be restored to her .
And you can live contentedly together ever after .
- That 's a proper ending to a story , isn 't it ?
- Lorraine . I forgot .
What ?
This is where she 's going to meet me at sundown .
I didn 't mean to trick you , monsieur .
I merely thought it would please her .
I still do . Whatever may happen afterwards .
Oh , Toto , it can 't be .
Why , even when I was innocent , her hatred of me hurt a good deal .
And now that I 'm guilty , her belief in me would hurt even more .
And if the police should ever ...
Oh , no , no .
- I 'm going .
- But where ?
At least you can tell me that .
I could send you your money and ...
Where I 'm going , Toto , I won 't need any money .
Goodbye , and remember I expect you to take good care of my little girl .
Watch your hats .
- Toto , have you seen the papers ? - Yes , dear .
- Then you 've read about Father ? - Yes .
- Aren 't you ashamed of me ?
- Of course not .
Well , I am , terribly .
I 'll never forgive myself never . I ...
I 'm sorry ?
- Are you Lorraine Lavond ?
- Yes . The daughter of Paul Lavond ?
- Yes .
He 's my father . - May I speak freely ?
- Yes , of course , monsieur .
- Where are you going , Toto ?
I 'll be right here , dear .
Won 't you sit down , mademoiselle ?
I was waiting for you because our friend here was good enough to tell me he was going to meet you .
You see , mademoiselle ...
- I 'm a friend of your father 's .
- Is he in Paris ?
- I served many years with him in prison .
- Where 's he now ?
- As a matter of fact , we escaped together .
- Oh , please tell me where he is .
I 'll search for him , anywhere .
You see , I 've hated my father all my life , and now I 've got to find him and beg his forgiveness .
And ask him to come home with me .
I don 't think he ever really thought you hated him .
- Are you sure ?
But he can never come home to you .
My dear child , your father is dead .
Yes .
He passed away in a swamp during our escape from prison .
The last thing he did was to write a letter to his mother , which I have given to Toto .
He sent me with a message to you .
He told me if I ever saw you , to take your hand and tell you that he loved you very dearly , and that all those years in prison he 'd watched you grow ,
talked to you , laughed with you , dined with you , and that he sent you a kiss .
Then , he said , this was the most important thing of all .
He told me to tell you to forget him .
To find happiness and keep it .
To marry and to give your children all the love you might have given him if he hadn 't been taken away from you .
It 's very kind of you to bring me this message .
Yes .
Little bit foolish , too .
The police are still after me .
Well , goodbye .
- Goodbye and good luck .
- Thank you .
Well , I better be going .
The sun 's almost down .
It 'll be up again tomorrow .
Will it ?
I wonder .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
Toto , I have the strangest feeling I 've seen him somewhere before .
- You have .
- Where ?
He was in the laundry looking for you .
There were so many people around , he got afraid .
On account of the police , I mean .
- That 's how he came to find me .
- Perhaps that 's it .
I don 't remember .
Remember me ?
Oh , Toto .
- It 's a nice evening , monsieur .
- Yes .
Probably the nicest evening of my life .
- Mr. Dodsworth ?
- Yes ?
The men are ready .
I hate to see you go , Sam .
Good-bye , Sam .
See if you can slip them into Mr. Dodsworth 's big leather suitcase .
Yes , ma 'am .
And when Miss Emily and Mr. McKee come back from their honeymoon ...
I 've put all the wedding presents in her old room .
- Yes , Mrs. Dodsworth .
- Oh , and the ...
Good afternoon , sir .
- Mr. Dodsworth 's paper ?
- Right here , ma 'am .
Over there .
Is everything settled ?
The Dodsworth Motor Company , Samuel Dodsworth , president and founder ... became the property of Union Motors a little over an hour ago .
How do you feel ?
How would any man feel who just sold 20 years of his life ?
I suppose you feel kind of lost .
I knew what I was doing when I sold , and I know what I 'm after from now on .
Oh , Sam , don 't look so mournful , darling .
All right , Mary .
I 'll fix you a drink .
Just think , Sammy , you 're free .
After 20 years of doing what was expected of us , we 're free .
I 'm just as keen on this trip as you are . I 'm rarin ' to go .
I 've always wanted to see London and Paris .
I want much more than a trip out of this , Sam .
I want a new life , all over from the very beginning .
A perfectly glorious , free , adventurous life .
It 's coming to us .
We 've done our job .
We 've brought up Emily and seen her married .
We 've got plenty of money .
Why , if we weren 't tied to this half-baked Middle Western town ...
- Fran , don 't start knocking Zenith .
- Darling , I 'm not knocking Zenith .
But have you ever thought what Zenith means to me ?
You go down to the plant and deal in millions and have a marvelous time .
I go down to the kitchen and order dinner .
Then there 's the ladies ' luncheon and bridge , always the same ladies .
Then dinner ... same people we dined with last week .
After dinner , poker for the men and women for the women .
There 's talk of children and doctors and servants and the garden club ...
Thought you liked the garden club .
I can 't go on liking the same things forever and ever .
Oh , Sammy darling , I want all the lovely things I 've got a right to .
In Europe , a woman of my age is just to the point ... where men begin to take a serious interest in her .
I won 't be put on the shelf for my daughter ... when I can still dance longer and better than she can .
After all , I 've got brains and , thank heavens , I 've still got looks .
Nobody takes me for over 32 ... 30 , even .
Oh , Sammy darling , I 'm begging for life .
No , I 'm not .
I 'm demanding it .
I see how you feel .
All right , I 'll enjoy life now if it kills me , and it probably will .
I spy you , European travelers .
Got a little spaghetti ?
- Hello , Tubby .
- Hello , Matey .
Hello , Tubby .
- We 're going with you .
- You 're not .
- As far as New York .
- What ?
- Can 't you offer a fellow a drink ?
- Get Tubby a drink .
Will you excuse me ?
I won 't be two seconds .
- Can I help ?
- I 'll be right back .
Run along anyway .
Run along .
- All right , say when .
- I don 't want a drink .
- What 's wrong ?
- I 'll stay sober till I bawl you out .
- What have I done ?
- You know very well .
Union Motors people been to the bank to see me about you .
What are they running around to you about me for ?
They want me to use my influence with you as your banker .
Don 't blame me if it doesn 't do any good .
They offered to make you first vice president of the whole outfit ... in charge of production of all their cars ...
They offered me $ 100,000 the first year in addition to stock which comes to ...
- You turned it down ?
- Yeah .
Americans like you and me can 't quit , Sam .
It 's meant that we should keep on working until we die in harness .
I 'm out to make a new life for myself .
I 'm out to learn how to enjoy my leisure , now I 've retired .
I 've been doing things people expected of me always .
I want to feel free .
I want to sit under a linden tree with nothing more important to worry about ... than the temperature of the beer , if there is anything more important .
If you think I can see my oldest and closest friend ... turned into an expatriate parlor snake ... because Zenith isn 't good enough for his wife ...
Ever since college , I 've yessed you and looked up to you . You 're a big man .
You 're a great industrialist .
You 're a representative citizen .
You 're pretty near everything I 'm not and ought to be .
But about your wife , you 're the dumbest , the sappiest , the most ...
It 's all right , Matey .
Tubby 's famous for his very peculiar brand of humor , aren 't you ?
It 's all right . I 'm glad you heard what I said .
Sam knows as well as I do ...
I don 't know anything of the kind .
I 'm out to see the world I haven 't seen and get a perspective on the USA .
I might get to know myself at the same time . I might even get to know my wife .
Oh , come along , Tubby .
We 'll be seeing you on the boat .
- You won 't see me there .
- Put that glass down too .
- See here .
- I 'm not going .
Did I remember to tell you today that I adore you ?
- Mother !
- Why , look who 's arrived !
- What are you doing here ?
- We thought you were in Nassau .
- We were yesterday .
- Yesterday ?
- You broke off the honeymoon ?
- Emily had had enough honeymoon .
I don 't think so much of sending a girl off with a husband she doesn 't know .
- How 'd you get here so soon ?
- We decided to surprise you .
We flew . You flew ?
I don 't want you flying around in airplanes .
- I 'm not taking any chances on you .
- It 's Harry 's job to worry about me now .
I don 't know whether this is going to make going away harder or easier .
A little of both .
Don 't see why we don 't rate a honeymoon .
Wait till you have a honeymoon 20 years from now .
All visitors ashore , please . All ashore that 's going ashore .
We just got here !
- I saw them . They 're right near the top .
- Hey , Emily !
- There they are .
- Oh , yes !
I see .
Bye !
- Fran ?
Fran ! We 're at sea !
- At sea ?
That 's putting it mildly .
Forget this trunk .
Come on out and see the ship .
- You sound happy .
I 'm so glad .
- This is the happiest day of my life !
Of course , except the day I married you .
Get off my dress .
Do you realize this is the first time we 've started out together as lovers ?
- I was right , wasn 't I ?
- Yeah , no more work .
- Now we 'll live .
- Together .
- Always .
- Let 's look at the ship .
I can 't .
I got to dress for dinner and so have you .
- We have to dress for dinner ?
- Of course .
Don 't you want to ?
Well , okay .
Remember the first time I asked you to marry me and we said we 'd come here ?
And here we are .
I love you more than ever now that I 've got time for it .
And I love you , Sammy .
- Looks like I made a slight error .
- That 's all right , sir .
Dry martini , please .
- Mr. Dodsworth ?
- Yes .
I heard you were on board .
I hope you don 't mind me introducing myself .
Not at all .
I 've just been driving one of your cars all through South America .
- How 'd it stand up ?
- Tough as nails .
Good .
- My name 's Lockert .
- Good to know you .
- Join me in a drink ?
- Thank you very much .
- What 'll you have ?
- Dry martini .
- Make it two , please .
- All right , sir .
I 'm waiting for my wife .
- I hope I 'm not intruding .
- Not at all .
Here she comes now .
- Dear .
- Hello , darling .
I want you to meet Mr. Lockert .
Mrs. Dodsworth .
- Captain Lockert .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- Shall we have a drink at the table ?
- Serve them over here , please .
- All right , sir .
You see , darling , we didn 't have to dress for dinner the first night out .
Of course , we can 't be expected to know all the tricks the first trip over .
It 's not my first trip over , Sammy dear .
That 's right .
Mrs. Dodsworth went to school in Switzerland one summer .
I can 't see it 's ever bad form to dress for dinner .
I 'm sure that anything that permits a woman ... to look as lovely as Mrs. Dodsworth is looking could never be bad form .
- Very good .
- This is just a simple dinner frock .
- Will you have this ?
- Thank you very much .
- Another martini , please .
- Yes , sir .
- New York , and now I 'm back to London .
- Really ?
- How long will you be in England ?
- We haven 't made plans beyond London .
There aren 't too many Americans ...
Look at those two women .
Can 't you just see them in Venice with their Baedekers ?
Why is it that traveling Americans are always so dreadful ?
Why is it Americans are always such snobs ?
You think it 's snobbish to want to see someone besides fellow citizens aboard ?
You can 't think of what one misses by leading a safe and sane American life .
Will you put me in charge of your safety and sanity ?
And tonight between 11 : 15 and 11 : 30, Mr. Dodsworth ... you will see this light off the port bow .
- Bishop 's Light , it 's called .
- Bishop 's Light ?
Yes , on Bishop 's Rock .
- You sorry it 's over ?
- What 's over ?
- The voyage .
- Oh , no .
Not that I 've been bored though .
You 've taken excellent care of that .
I 'm making great plans for us in London .
For us ? I know these steamship intimacies .
They never survive dry land .
Why can 't you believe that this , as they say , is different ?
- What ?
- It was land .
- Was it , Sammy dear ?
- Bishop 's Light , they call it .
I could get ashore in an hour if I had a motorboat .
I can 't believe we 've done it !
Ashore ! In England !
I don 't know what to do about Sam 's Anglomania .
That 's all right about my Anglomania , but come look at the light with me .
All right .
Come on . Let 's look at the light .
Now don 't hurry me , Sam .
I 've got on high heels .
My hair will be ruined in this wind !
I 'm freezing ! I haven 't got any coat !
- Put this on .
- Please .
What difference does it make ?
- I don 't see any light . - Wait .
You 'll see it in a minute .
- Where will I look ?
- Look straight over there .
- I can 't see it .
- Wait .
There it goes !
See it ?
That 's very pretty , but you can have your coat now .
Captain Lockert and I have to dance .
- It 'll flash again in a minute .
- I just can 't stay . It 's too cold .
- There it goes again !
- I 'd like to stay and watch ...
- Coming , Lockert ?
- Yes , coming .
Say , Fran , I could get ashore in half an hour if I had a fast motorboat !
- I beg pardon , sir .
- Oh , yeah , sure .
That 's right .
Oh , well , sir , last night of the voyage .
- Yes , sir , half an hour , maybe less .
- Beg pardon , sir .
- Bring me a drink out here , will you ?
- What would you like ?
Bring me something quieting to the nerves .
- Quieting , sir ?
- Yeah ...
- Why don 't you try stout , Mr. Dodsworth ?
- I beg your pardon ?
You asked for something quieting , and I prescribed stout .
- A double stout , sir ? - All right , sure .
Yeah .
What is it you called that light ?
I saw it too .
Bishop 's Light .
Of course , I 've never been across before .
I got excited .
I took one look at that light and all I read about England came to light .
The town behind it with those flat-faced brick houses ... and a cart crawling up a hill between high hedges ... and Jane Austen , Oliver Twist and Sherlock Holmes .
England . Mother England .
- Home .
- Have you always felt that way ?
I don 't know .
It just now struck me , but I guess I must have .
Most Americans would if it weren 't taught out of them .
- All my people came from England .
- Sit down , Mr. Dodsworth .
You do need soothing .
I 've been having such a good time on this trip .
Everybody 's so nice .
There 's nothing like a first trip to Europe .
Especially when you 're old enough to know what you 're after .
" What you 're after . " What are you after ?
My wife , of course , she 's been over before .
She wants me to learn how to enjoy my leisure , now I 've retired .
But what it boils down to ...
I 've been doing things myself for a long time .
I thought I 'd give things a chance to do something to me .
- The education of an American .
- Yes , you might call it that .
- How long have you given yourself ?
- Six months .
- To get all that done ?
- I 'll be homesick by then .
I was homesick the first year I came over .
- Came over ?
Where from ?
- Michigan .
- American , huh ?
- I don 't know what I am .
I used to be a British subject by marriage .
I don 't know that one can be a British subject by divorce .
I expect I 'm just a woman who lives in Italy .
- Do people live in Italy ?
- There are countless Italians .
I mean , people like you .
I live in Italy by the thousands .
- Why ?
- It 's cheap .
My wife tells me I ask too many questions .
Dear Sam .
Sometimes he has got the most bourgeois ideas .
Bishop 's Light .
Look at my hair .
Can 't do a thing with it .
Guess that 'll have to do .
- Well , how do I look ?
All right ? - Superb .
- Shall we go ?
- Look what I 've got .
Can 't we stay and have our nightcap down here ?
Why not ?
We can 't go off and leave everything as perfect as this .
That 'd be ridiculous .
I 'd like to stay right here and see the dawn .
You don 't think he 'll roar around the ship and shoot when he finds me here ?
Who , Sam ?
Oh , no .
No , he 's got all the old-fashioned virtues , except jealousy .
You call that a virtue ?
When a wife who isn 't plain seems to be attractive to men ... and doesn 't mind their showing they 're attracted .
Yes , I think I see what you mean .
- Highball ?
- Yes , thanks .
- Two highballs , please .
- Two scotch and sodas , sir ?
Yeah , all right .
You got my name .
Would you mind telling me yours ?
- Mrs. Cortright .
- Mrs. Cortright .
Thanks .
We haven 't spoken before .
You don 't talk to many people on board .
My wife said you didn 't open up much when she tried you .
Perhaps I wasn 't feeling so well that day .
- Feeling better tonight ?
- Much better . Thank you .
You 've lived abroad .
What 's it like ?
That depends on what one 's after , as you would say .
When a man has no more job and his wife wants a fling ... there are worse things than travel .
It wouldn 't do for me though .
No , not long , it wouldn 't .
For a steady thing , give me America . For Americans , that is .
Drifting isn 't nearly so pleasant as it looks .
Why don 't you give it up ?
One drifts for lack of a reason to do anything else .
Well , what do you want ?
What do you suppose any Ione woman wants ?
Guess I 've been talking too much again .
Don 't leave me and go trekking all over the continent .
Stay in London .
I should miss you so terribly .
You don 't mean that , and I don 't want you to mean it .
You 're so wrong , Fran dear .
Some , I assure you , have never been given a chance .
I shouldn 't be human if I didn 't love hearing that .
Really .
Really , Clyde , that 's a very silly thing to do .
I don 't think I like it .
If you don 't mind my saying , I find you extraordinarily attractive .
Don 't you think you and I , perhaps , have been seeing too much of each other ?
My dear Fran , dismiss that idea from your mind at once ... and come and have lunch with me in London tomorrow .
I most certainly shall not have luncheon with you in London tomorrow ... and I shall say good night now .
Can 't you think of anything more cheerful to say than just good night ?
Couldn 't you say , " Good night , Clyde , " or even , " Good night , Clyde dear " ?
Good night is all I 'm inclined to say .
You 're taking a wickedly unfair advantage of me .
I only thought I was doing what was expected of me .
- What I expected of you ?
- Not you alone , Fran .
There 's a tradition about this sort of thing .
I thought civilized people knew where an innocent flirtation stops .
For a civilized woman who 's been married as long as you have ... you 're making a great deal of a small matter .
It 's not a small matter to me .
I offer you my most abject apology .
If I might offer you one small word of advice ... give up starting things you 're not prepared to finish .
It 's quite evident they only lead you out of your depth .
You think I 'm not equal to your impudence ?
Look at the exhibition you 're making of yourself .
I ?
Any modern schoolgirl could compete with this situation .
You 've got the most childish misconception of yourself .
You think you 're a woman of the world , and you 're nothing of the sort .
If I should send for the steward to have you put out , my husband will hear of it .
He most certainly will .
I shall make an enormous noise .
Good night , Captain .
- Oh , hello .
- Hello .
- Well , this is a good connection .
- You 're not going ?
Yes , I 've got to tuck in now .
- Nightcap before you go ?
- No , thank you .
I 've got to pack .
- We 'll be seeing you .
- Yes , that 's right .
- Sure you won 't have lunch tomorrow ?
- Quite sure .
That 's too bad .
I think you would have enjoyed that lunch .
Well ...
He 's not so bad .
He 's fresh , but he 's not so bad .
Why , darling ?
Why , darling , what is it ?
What is it , darling , huh ?
I 've never been so furious in my life .
- About Lockert ?
- Don 't speak that rotter 's name .
- What did he do ?
- He insulted me .
- How far did he go ?
- He said things to me , Sam ...
He said things ... I can 't bear it .
Well , I suppose it 's up to me to go up and shoot him .
Don 't joke !
I would feel like a fool .
You and I are not up to this sort of thing .
It kind of makes us look like the hicks we are .
It does , and it 's your own fault for leading him on .
- I suppose I 'm to blame .
- You must have given him some excuse .
You have been flirting with him .
You 've got such a sweet way of bawling me out in front of him , he 'd conclude ...
I never said a word to embarrass you in all my life .
I 've always been loyal to you .
You 'll be sorry for this .
- Fran , I 'm tired .
- Don 't you think I 'm tired too ?
All right then , we 're both tired .
There were some cigarettes here somewhere .
Here they are .
- Sam ?
- Yeah ?
Don 't let 's go to England at all .
What ?
We 're there now .
I want to go over to France right away .
I 'm so ashamed of this Lockert business .
I 'm ashamed way deep down inside me .
What difference does that make ?
I want to go to England .
I 've got a date to look at automobile factories ...
I can 't stay in England with that man laughing at me and saying ...
What ?
That you kicked him out ?
That 's not what he 'll say .
Silly .
Yeah ?
You 've got to take care of me .
You really have , Sam .
I don 't trust myself .
I 'm afraid of myself .
- You 're afraid , sweetheart ?
- Yes , I am .
I 'm just a wooly American like you after all .
If you ever catch me trying to be anything else , will you beat me ?
Well , will I have to beat you very long at a time ?
Oh , Sam , come in and finish your breakfast .
You know , Fran , when you think of it , that 's a thrill , a real thrill .
Down there where the obelisk stands , that 's where the guillotine used to be .
That 's where that what 's-her-name ?
That Madam Roland said ...
" O Liberty , what crimes are committed in thy name ! "
Only in French .
That 's where Madam ... Marie Antoinette had her head cut off .
Sammy darling , I 've said good morning to the obelisk for the last time .
From now on , I 'm just gonna pretend it isn 't there at all .
Okay .
Well , what are your plans for today ?
My plans ? I don 't know .
What are yours ?
- I 'm going to look at Napoleon 's tomb .
- You 'll love that , I 'm sure .
- Come with me ?
- This morning ?
I 'm afraid I can 't .
I have a fitting at 11 : 00 and the hairdresser 's at 11 : 30 .
Renée de Penable is fetching me .
Oh , see who that is , will you ?
Hello ?
Okay , send her up .
- Who 's that ?
- It 's Madame de Penable .
Oh , I must hurry .
Sammy , put on your coat .
This is much too domestic .
And put the cover on the ham and the eggs .
I simply cannot understand how anyone can eat the breakfast you do .
Here in France , they 've learned the wisdom of beginning the day fasting .
In the few weeks I 've been here , I 've learned it myself .
But you still eat the breakfast you do at home .
- I still got the same insides .
- Yes , I 'm afraid you have .
- Is that my Petite Parisienne ?
- No , that 's my Paris Herald .
What good does your patootie do me ?
- Oh , meet me for lunch ?
- No , I can 't .
Renée 's giving it to me at the Ritz .
Well , how about meeting me at the Café de la Paix at 4 : 00 ?
Well , Sammy , I 'll try .
- All right .
Bye .
- Good-bye .
Good morning .
The first on the list today is Napoleon 's tomb .
- How 's the French coming ?
- Fine !
Yesterday I said to a taxi driver ... And he understood me . Oh , excuse me .
My guidebook .
You just don 't know Sam .
He 's really very sweet .
There he comes now .
- Arnold !
- Renée , so glad to see you .
And this , Mrs. Dodsworth , is Mr. Arnold Iselin .
How do you do ?
What brings you back from Dublin so soon ?
- I hope it wasn 't business .
- No , nothing so vulgar as business .
- Who is that ?
- That is the Comtesse De La Villalonga .
- Tea ?
- Yes , thank you .
I really think I ought to go and speak with her .
May I leave you in Mr. Iselin 's most excellent care ?
Renée has the most amusing friends , doesn 't she ?
And the most charming .
How much ?
17.50 .
- More tea ?
- Yes , thank you .
You know , I never thought I 'd find Paris so exciting .
What can I do to find myself a part of your Paris ?
Come and dine with us tomorrow .
You free ?
Of course .
I tell you , it was very interesting .
Yes , sir .
Then I went inside and looked at the tomb where he lies .
There we were , Napoleon and Sam Dodsworth of Zenith together .
Excuse me , my dear Fran , I really must be going .
Really ?
Good night .
Sam , get Renée 's wraps for her , will you ?
So sorry it 's been so dull .
We 'd much better have celebrated my birthday as I wanted at some nightclub .
But Sam always persists in taking care that I don 't get tired .
Tired .
Here we are .
I hadn 't realized it was your birthday .
No ?
Wish I hadn 't .
No woman enjoys getting to be 35 .
When you 're my age , you look back on 35 as a most agreeable time of life .
I hope I look as young as you do when I 'm your age .
You 're almost sure to , my dear .
I must get my coat too .
I left my coat in the garde-robe below .
Good night , Baron .
Thank you so much for your sweet flowers .
Phone me up tomorrow .
Perhaps we can dine somewhere for tea .
I 'd love to .
Sam , will you put Renée and the baron in the lift ?
Sure , be glad to .
- Well , I 'm glad you did .
- Have you been to the opera ?
Smoke another cigarette .
It has been very charming .
Then come and dine with us again .
You and your husband must come to me next .
Are you free Tuesday ?
Shall we say 8 : 00 ?
Quai Voltaire , straight over the river .
What a charming address .
We shall look forward to it .
Nerves , dear lady , nerves .
I 'm poor in so many ways .
So many .
- Thank you so much , Mrs. Dodsworth .
- I suppose we won 't be seeing you again .
I 'm really off to Italy in the morning .
My dear , don 't .
What ?
You 're so charming .
Well , you 're not going ?
Yes , I stole a bit of your letter paper to write my address in Italy on it .
- It 's near Naples .
- We 'll use it when we 're your way .
- Please do .
- Good night . Bon voyage .
Thank you .
Good night .
- I must be going too .
- Good night .
You were saying something about the first Benz car .
Another night . That will keep .
Good night .
Good night , sir .
You like that woman , don 't you ?
You thought she was the most distinguished-Iooking woman on the boat .
Seems a frump in Paris .
Unfasten me , will you ?
I 'm always glad to see your friends , even the not particularly amusing ones .
Don 't you think we 've had about enough of Paris ?
In a month ?
My dear Sam .
Don 't you think it 's about time we 're beating it back home ?
Home ?
No , I should think not .
I want to see lots more of Europe .
So do I , but we could get in a couple of months in the Mediterranean ... and Germany and still catch an August sailing .
I want to see Venice and Rome .
Still planning your sightseeing tours , Sammy dear ?
I don 't see much percentage in sitting here on my ...
Bring me my cold cream , will you , Sammy ?
It 's in the bathroom .
We got to begin making plans pretty soon .
Why don 't you go home ?
- Without you ?
- Yeah .
Get yourself a new lease on life and come back here and join me .
Why don 't ya ?
I wouldn 't want to go home without you .
I can see you 're not enjoying yourself in Paris .
I 'm only thinking of your pleasure .
If you 've got a mind , you wouldn 't ask me to leave .
I just made nice friends .
I don 't think they 're so nice .
I don 't , and I don 't see what you see in them .
This Arnold Iselin may be all he says he is internationally and financially ... but he certainly is no Barney Baruch .
That Mrs. De Penable , I suppose she 's all right ... if you don 't mind your friend collecting commission on the dresses you buy .
I hate to think who pays the bill when that young Austrian takes you out .
Arnold Iselin happens to be one of the most famous living financiers ... and a distinguished art collector .
And Renée ...
By the way , she 's Madame de Penable , not Mrs. Penable .
Renée is the true woman of this great world here .
The baron may be poor , but he holds one of the oldest titles in Austria .
They all belong to the smartest crowd in Paris .
You think the real thing in Paris would hang out with a couple of hicks like us ?
What else are we ?
I 'm just an ordinary American businessman ... and I married the daughter of a Zenith brewer who 's flying high these days .
I suppose you know what you mean by that .
- Why won 't you sit at a cafe with me ?
- Smart people don 't .
- I 'm not smart .
- I am .
You ought to be smart enough not to care what people think .
It 's self-respect , like the Englishman dressing for dinner in the jungle .
I read about him .
He probably never did it .
- You simply will not understand .
If I want men to be something more than waiters !
- I 've heard my friends insulted enough !
- A lot of moochers .
Let 's hear about the great motor magnate and what he did for the auto industry .
You may be the most impressive man in Zenith , but you 're not in Zenith now .
You 're in Paris now , and I 'm sick of apologizing to my friends ...
- How you been apologizing for me ? - Yes , I have !
Hello ?
Yes ?
All right .
We 've been making so much noise someone 's complained .
- How humiliating .
- Yes , isn 't it ?
All right , go ahead .
Pipe down , but go ahead .
I 'm waiting .
You 're hopeless .
You haven 't the mistiest notion of civilization here .
Maybe I don 't think so much of it though .
Maybe clean hospitals , concrete highways ... and no soldiers on the Canadian border come nearer my idea of civilization .
There are 20 million automobiles in America .
I 've contributed something to every one of them from my own civilization .
If that isn 't more than knowing how to order dinner as your friend the madam ...
- Don 't call her " the madam " either .
- All right .
- Don 't let 's go into that again .
- You don 't want to learn .
I could teach you .
I belong here .
- They accept me here .
- Yeah ?
I 'm gonna get out of this town and back to doing something and take you along .
- I 'm not going .
- Yes , you are .
No , I 'm not .
I think you and I need a vacation from each other .
I don 't feel that way about it .
I think I 've been weak with you long enough .
Besides ...
I 've rented a villa with Renée for the summer ... at Montreux on Lake Geneva in Switzerland .
I 've signed the lease .
Well , I think you might have told me .
I got my own money .
- Fran !
- What ?
Fran , my darling , you 're not drifting away from me .
- I hope not .
- Oh , no .
You and I , Fran , after all these years .
All right , I 'll give it up .
I won 't go home .
But you 've got to go .
You 've simply got to .
I can 't stand being torn like this any longer .
I 'm sorry for all the mean things I 've said to you .
But if we are going to go on together , you 've got to let me alone this summer .
Don 't look so hurt , and please don 't be angry .
Oh , be as angry as you like .
Remember , I did make a home for you once , and I 'll do it again ... only you 've got to let me have my fling now ... because you 're simply rushing at old age , Sam .
I 'm not ready for that yet .
What is it , Sam ?
I just thought I 'd see the first boat I could catch .
- I 'm so glad you 're back .
- I 'm glad to see you .
- Let me look at you .
You look all right .
- I 'm fine .
How 's Harry ?
Is he treating you all right ?
He better treat you all right .
Where is he ?
He 's at the office .
Got a big deal on . Couldn 't get away .
He told me to tell you he 'd see you tonight though .
Big deal , eh ?
- How 's Mother ?
- She 's all right .
Why didn 't she come home with you ?
She 's got some things she wants to attend to .
Why did you come home without her ?
Well , she ...
What are you so nosy about ?
- How 's the new house coming along ?
- Oh , it 's wonderful .
- Do you want to drive out and see it ?
- No , I want to go home .
I 'll see it tomorrow .
How about a little check to help furnish it , huh ?
No , thanks , darling .
Just because I 've stopped working that doesn 't mean I 've stopped being helpful .
We don 't need your help .
We 're getting along fine now .
Yeah ?
Well ... could you use this ?
Could I ?
Oh , it 's beautiful .
And here .
Two of them .
- Faster . Can 't you make it go faster ?
- All right .
Hold on !
- Fast enough ?
- Yeah .
Kurt , why don 't you go in and play for us ?
- Shall we make music , Renée ?
- If you like .
- You coming inside ?
- Inside ?
Oh , no .
Let 's stay out here , Arnold .
The music will sound so lovely out here .
The afternoon post came while you were gone .
Perhaps you may amuse Arnold by reading your husband 's letter to him .
Would you do something for me ?
Within reason , why not ?
Read your husband 's letter .
That 's an odd request , Arnold .
Anything within reason , you said .
I have my reasons .
Why did you make me read this letter ?
I 've been having such fun today .
This letter 's spoiled everything .
Switzerland , the lake , the house .
All of it 's just so much Zenith now .
Presently he 'll be taking you back to Zenith .
What are you doing , trying to torture me ?
I 'm making love to you .
What do you expect me to say to that ?
Don 't make love to me , Arnold .
Afraid , Fran ?
Surely not afraid .
If your husband had saved for you some of the love he lavished on carburetors ...
My dear innocent Fran .
I 'm not innocent , and Sam does love me .
No matter what he lacks , I 've always been able to trust him .
I live in the present .
Why don 't you ?
This letter is the past .
It 's a future too , at least it is for me .
Let 's get rid of both past and future .
How ?
Would this be of any use to you ?
What ?
Why should I say anything I didn 't think ?
- You didn 't think what I thought ?
- Maybe I don 't care what you think !
- You ought to care what I think !
- I didn 't know you could think !
- Dad !
- Is that so ?
- Did you have a good time ?
- Had a wonderful time !
Simply terrible !
What is this , the heat wave or just a hangover ?
- It 's Sam ! - Sam !
Yeah , sure !
Griping , just griping , always griping .
- I 'm going home !
- Go ahead !
- Sit down .
- I 'm goin ' home .
- Did a cable come for me today ?
- No , Father .
There should have been a cable from your mother .
I 'll have Mary telephone .
- Don 't trouble .
- It 's no trouble .
If a cable had come , they 'd have sent it out , wouldn 't they ?
- Don 't be cross .
- I 'm not cross just because I asked .
In the old days , I wouldn 't have to ask . Been laid out on my desk for me .
The way things are run around this house I can 't find anything of mine .
- Please don 't be difficult .
- Why shouldn 't I be difficult ?
When a man 's made to feel more homeless in his own house than he did in Paris !
- Now , Sam .
- It 's true .
Only I 'm not being difficult .
- Where 's my mail ?
- There isn 't any .
- No mail ?
- Not since the last I sent you .
My mail should be laid out on that desk .
Your mother always had my mail laid out on that desk .
- No mail , no cable .
- Is that the trouble ?
- What ?
- No mail , no cable ?
And my whiskey should be laid out on that table too .
Your mother always had it there waiting for me .
Whiskey and soda and ice .
I remember .
If you remember , why hasn 't it been set out once since I came home from Europe ?
- You haven 't spoken of it before .
- Don 't think I haven 't missed it .
Mary , will you please bring my father 's whiskey and soda ?
I 'm sorry , ma 'am , but the wine closet 's locked .
- Well , unlock it .
- Harry 's got the key on his watch chain .
What 's the key to my liquor doing on my son-in-law 's watch chain ?
You gave Harry that key , and he 's taking very good care of it .
You 're taking his side against me , are ya ?
- It doesn 't matter , Sam ...
- Excuse me , Matey , but it does matter .
If a man can 't invite a friend of his to have a drink in his own library ...
Never said anything about a drink to me !
- I was just going to .
- That 's all , Mary .
Thank you .
- If I can 't give you a drink ...
- But you can in a minute , Father .
Harry will be home any minute . I know because we 're going to a cocktail party .
- Will you have a cigar ?
- Anything , Sam .
Anything .
- Where are the cigars ?
- Harry smokes cigarettes .
- I 'll have Mary telephone him ...
- Wait a minute !
Where 's the humidor that used to be on this table ?
- It isn 't there now .
- It stood there for years !
- Mary , where 's Father 's humidor ?
- I 'm sorry , ma 'am ...
It stood right there !
It was round and copper-like on the outside .
Oh , that .
Mrs. McKee took it to plant bulbs in .
- Plant bulbs in my humidor , eh ?
- Just a few hyacinths .
- What 's this truck here ?
- That 's a jigsaw puzzle .
- Get it out of here .
- You can 't move it ...
A man 's got to have one room in his own house that he can feel at home in !
Get this thing out of here now !
I don 't want it in here .
You be careful , Sam .
Be careful .
Let me do that .
- Don 't drop it .
Give it to me .
- What foolishness is it anyway ?
- What 's it supposed to be ?
- It was going to be the Chicago Fire .
- Chicago Fire ?
- They got the title almost put together .
- What 's a cow doing in the Chicago Fire ?
- It started by a cow kicking a lantern .
That isn 't the way the Chicago Fire started .
Yes , it was .
It was an earthquake in ' Frisco and a cow in Chicago .
- My father was in Chicago in ' 71 !
- That was after the fire .
- That 's the year of the fire !
- The fire was in the ' 60s .
- That was the Civil War !
- They were both in the ' 60s !
I 'll bet you !
Where 's my encyclopedia ?
- Here . Take the truck .
- What 'll I do with it ?
Take it out of here .
It never would have been in here in your mother 's day .
Your mother had some respect for a man 's library .
No mail , no cable , no cigars .
Hello , everybody .
How about a drink ?
Father , I 'm sorry things aren 't the way they used to be .
But Harry and I are living in this house too .
I wish you 'd stop speaking of Mother as though she were dead .
I 'm not speaking of your mother as though she ...
Yes , you are .
- Well , your mother 's coming home .
- When 's she coming ?
I sent a cable for her to come .
I 'm expecting a cable telling me what boat .
When Mother didn 't come home with you and you looked so worried ...
I was afraid there might be some kind of trouble between you .
Between your mother and me ?
Not a chance .
- It was silly . - Certainly was .
I forgot . I 've got a cable .
It was sent in my care ... so it came to the office somehow .
" Ladies first " as they say in a shipwreck .
What 's the matter ?
Isn 't Mother coming ?
This is nothing .
This isn 't from your mother .
I thought you were going to a cocktail party .
- We were ...
- Go on and go .
- We don 't have to ...
- Go on and go .
Ya big stiff .
You old horse thief .
Sam , you old darling .
- She 's not coming .
- I guessed as much .
It 's lonesome here without her .
What does she say ?
" Want few more months Europe .
Hope you 're having good time home . "
I cable her to come and she doesn 't say one word about me going over .
- She 's thoughtless .
- No , she 's not , Matey .
She 's scared .
Fran scared ?
What of ?
Of growing old .
That 's very smart of you , Sam .
Yeah .
- Will you read her last letter ?
- Fran 's letter to you ?
Yes , it 's not so private .
- What 's this ?
- The way they make sevens in France .
Sounds like a beautiful place .
- Have you seen it ?
- No .
- What ?
- She said they 're having a good time .
Well , it sounds like a healthy time .
- You know these people ?
- Yes .
- You like them ?
- Well , they 're all right .
They 're very clever people .
They 're not my style .
I see .
- Well ?
- Nothing .
You 're an old friend , Matey .
I don 't know what to think .
Who 's Arnold Iselin ?
He 's one of those custom-built internationals ... you see in the rotogravure section every Sunday .
- Well , give us a kiss now .
- Matey , I thought you wanted to ...
Will you lay off those European liberties with my wife ?
Come along . Come on .
Western Union , please .
Hello .
Take a cable going to Mrs. Dodsworth .
This is Samuel Dodsworth speaking .
Same address as my last .
Ready ?
" Sailing Aquitania Wednesday . Stop .
Meet me Créon Paris . Love .
Signed , Sam . "
And take another , going to A.B. Hurd ...
H-U-R-D ...
Manager , Dodsworth Car , Paris .
" Sailing Aquitania Wednesday .
Stop .
Using utmost discretion ascertain ... day-to-day address of Arnold Iselin ... l-S-E-L-l-N ...
Paris .
Stop .
Keep me informed wireless .
Another wireless , Mr. Dodsworth .
" To Samuel Dodsworth , Aquitania , Iselin At Present Biarritz .
Will you sign , sir ?
- Where is Biarritz ?
- Biarritz is in France , sir .
Down by the Spanish border .
It 's a fashionable watering place .
- Yes , thank you .
- Thank you , sir .
Oh , darling !
- You look fine .
- You don 't look bad yourself .
- When 'd you get to Paris ?
- Before dinner .
- You must be tired .
- I 'm not tired .
How far is it from Montreux ?
I came much further than that .
I came all the way from Biarritz .
What 's the matter ?
Nothing .
How are Emily and Matey and Tubby ?
Tell me all the news .
Everybody 's fine .
You might go a little more into detail .
After all , Emily 's my daughter too .
Emily 's very happy .
That marriage is working out all right .
I 'm so glad .
Of course , I never thought Harry was very exciting .
Weren 't you pretty lonely in Biarritz ?
I wasn 't sorry to be by myself for a bit .
Why do you keep looking at your watch all the time ?
- I 've never seen you like this before .
- No ?
I 've never seen you like this either , Fran .
What 'd you do to your hair ?
Oh , just touched it up a bit .
Like it ?
This looks natural .
Well , it was as cool as anything they had , so I took it again .
Yeah ?
Well , all hotel rooms look alike to me .
Wait a minute .
Where are you going ?
He 's just going to put the bags in the other room .
What room ?
I thought you 'd be tired after your long trip .
The weather being so stifling , I took the two bedrooms this time .
You don 't mind the separate rooms , do you , Sam ?
I don 't mind anything now that I 'm back with you again .
Let 's don 't stay here .
Let 's go out and find some cool spot and have a drink .
- I thought you were tired .
- No , I 'm not tired .
There you go , looking at your watch again .
Really . It 's not very polite .
If my company hangs so heavily on your hands ... why did you make me leave Biarritz and come all this way ?
- I 'm expecting a visitor .
- At this time of night ?
At Cherbourg , I telegraphed a man to meet me here . I 'll give him 10 minutes ...
Here we are .
Hello ?
Yes , I 'm expecting him .
Send him up , please .
- I 'll wait in the bedroom .
- No , you stay .
But your business acquaintances don 't amuse me too terribly , you know , Sam .
This is not a business acquaintance .
- Someone I know ?
- Yes .
- Someone from Zenith ?
- You 'll see who it is .
Has Renée de Penable been gossiping ?
If she has , it 's a pack of lies .
I haven 't heard a word from Mrs. Penable .
What are you up to ?
Steady , darling . Sit down .
Come in .
Good evening .
Good evening .
Was it Arnold you telegraphed to ?
I think you might have told me .
It wasn 't my idea to tell you .
I tried to reach you over the telephone to tell you that I was coming .
I wanted to see you two face-to-face .
Fran alone would 've wasted time acting .
I knew you 'd been in Biarritz together .
I 'm sorry .
I hate undercover work myself .
I wouldn 't have got where I have if it hadn 't been in me to be ruthless .
It 's the most outrageous thing I 've ever heard in my life .
- What if Arnold was in Biarritz ?
- Won 't you let me handle my part ?
Let me remind you that Shakespeare 's Othello ends badly for the hero .
I 'm not Othello .
This is not the Middle Ages .
None of us speak blank verse , not even you .
You are rather jumping at conclusions , you know .
Have you ever noticed how transparent people are when you really look at them ?
What are you implying ?
Do you know how insulting you are ?
You don 't know how insulting I 'm going to be if you don 't stop playacting .
I 'm sure you 've given her things she needed and wanted and never got from me .
I 'm interested in what I need and want and that happens to be peace of mind .
If you can bring yourself to see matters reasonably ...
I 've crossed the Atlantic Ocean to be reasonable .
I 've loved you and been married to you for 20 years .
I want to hold on to you if I can .
You want to marry each other ?
I won 't let you throw me at Arnold 's head .
You want to divorce me then ?
Why should I want to divorce you ?
You 're my husband .
You couldn 't very well divorce me if I weren 't .
- You can laugh .
- Yes , I can do worse than that .
I 'm finding all this very distasteful .
- It 's ridiculous .
- Certainly it 's ridiculous .
The old triangle stuff .
I knew we 'd all end by looking like fools .
- I go now if you 'll excuse me .
- Sure , I 'll excuse you .
You have nothing more to say to him , have you ?
I hope you achieve your peace of mind , Mr. Dodsworth .
- Thank you .
Good night .
- Good night .
I 'm so sorry , Sam .
I 'm so terribly sorry .
Well , I 'm ready to wipe the slate clean if you are ... and start out on a long hike tomorrow .
Anything you say , Sam .
Anything you say .
Italy , anyplace ... till we sail back home in December .
Home in December .
Zenith in December .
You 'll want to go home in December .
Emily 's having a baby in December .
- A baby ?
- Yes .
- She didn 't tell me .
- She left me the fun of telling you .
- Is she well ?
- Yes , she 's fine .
I must send her a cable .
No , I could telephone her , couldn 't I ?
What time is it in Zenith ?
We 'll have to learn to behave ourselves ... when we 'll be a couple of old grandparents in December .
Here you are , young one .
It 's your mama and daddy .
Where 's that telegram ?
Over there .
Listen to this , young fella .
" Mr. Samuel Dodsworth McKee . "
That 's you .
Are you listening ?
" Congratulations on your arrival . Stop .
We send all our love and affection .
Grandpa and Grandma Dodsworth . "
See ?
Look at it .
Just think , Mr. McKee ... all the way from Vienna .
I do love Vienna .
Don 't you ?
I love you , Fran .
Oh , Sam darling .
I 'm so silly and heedless , and I don 't speak of it as often as I should ... but I 'm terribly grateful inside .
I want you back for my wife .
Shall I tell you how ?
By understanding , by staying on here in Europe ... by helping me forget Arnold Iselin .
By forgetting him yourself .
- Haven 't you anything to say ?
- What is there to say ?
After having opened my heart to you ... it makes me a little self-conscious to see you there not saying anything .
" Self-conscious " ?
Maybe that 's my trouble .
Maybe that 's the trouble with all reconciled couples afterwards .
That 's not very generous of you .
I 've lost my bearings .
I don 't know where I 'm heading .
- Who are you calling ?
- I thought I 'd like to talk to Emily .
We sent her a cable already .
I 'd like to hear her voice and see how the baby got through his first day .
There 's not time .
Those transatlantic calls are slow from here .
And Kurt 'll be coming in .
Kurt can wait .
I won 't have Kurt standing around while you and I gush to Emily .
I know how thrilled you are about the baby , and so am I ... but all our friends here think of me as young , and I am .
I was such a child when you married me .
It isn 't fair .
Come in .
Good evening .
I brought you a box of real Havana cigars .
- Very kind of you .
- Smuggled through without duty .
Tonight I take you to a very gay restaurant with very good food .
- And dance after ?
- If you make Sam get dressed .
I think I 'll let you go without me .
No , you must come with us !
What fun do you think it is for me to sit all night watching you two dance ?
Do not speak so crossly .
You should be happy to see Fran happy .
She is so lovely when she 's happy .
I 'm sorry I snapped .
I 'd only spoil your fun .
I got important news from home today .
Yes ?
News ?
Nothing that would interest you .
Bad news ?
No , not bad .
I think I 'll sit here by myself and think things over .
Perhaps Sam would rather be left alone tonight ... but I want to go out .
- Have you been quarreling , you two ?
- No .
You must not .
You 're here so small a time .
Perhaps I shall never see you again .
Let 's not be serious .
Come with us .
Life is so short .
Life will be a lot shorter for me if I don 't get some sleep .
You run along and have your fun .
Thank you , Sam dear , for so many things .
Come on , Kurt .
I 'm sorry , Sam .
Good night .
Oh , I simply adore it .
I think you were meant to dance all your life long .
You couldn 't suggest anything I 'd like any better .
Thanks .
Good night .
Fun and friends all evening .
- Is that right ?
- Yeah .
Don 't stand there in the doorway .
Come on in .
I do not like coming in here so late .
I do not think Sam would like it .
Have we even sent him any reason to mind ?
No .
Don 't be a stinker .
Sam 's dead to the world .
Just don 't talk loud , that 's all .
Sit down .
Give me my purse .
Thank you .
Darling ...
You know I love you , Fran .
You know that .
You must stop that kind of talk .
Is it so wicked ?
Have you not been happy with me in Vienna ?
I 've been terribly happy .
You know that .
I think you could love me .
I think you could .
There 's nothing we can do about it , is there ?
No , that 's true .
My hands are tied .
You 're married to Sam , my friend .
I can 't ask you to be my wife .
You want to marry me ?
Does it surprise you ?
Why are you not free ?
If I were free ...
- Fran , if you were free ... - Don 't .
Please don 't .
Forgive me .
You better go now .
I didn 't know you 'd come in .
I 'm sorry I woke you up .
It 's pretty late , not that I mind you and Kurt staying out late .
What did you want ?
Have things got this bad ?
I 'm too tired to talk tonight .
If things have got this bad , they 've got to stop altogether .
I 'm willing to do anything to make you happy .
I love you . You know that .
But if we 're going on together , as you said in Paris ...
I 'm saying it now , we 've got to beat it right back home where we belong .
Is that your idea of making me happy ?
I 'm not taking any more chances on another Arnold Iselin .
I know this friendship with Kurt is harmless enough ... but you might get fascinated .
You think I might ?
You really think I might ?
Well , I love Kurt , and Kurt loves me , and I 'm going to marry him .
He asked me tonight .
I decided it now when I found you here hiding behind doors ... the Great Dodsworth , great prowling elephant .
I wish Kurt had stayed to punch your head for spying on us .
I wasn 't spying .
You can 't play the injured innocent with me !
You 've never known anything about me ... not what I thought or the sacrifices I 've made .
- Look out !
- I 'll be happy with Kurt .
I 'm fighting for life !
You can 't drag me back !
Will you get your divorce here ?
Yes , I suppose so .
I wish you 'd put it off for a couple of months .
Why ?
I 'd like you to feel sure of Kurt .
Well , it 's my funeral now , isn 't it ?
Yes , I guess so .
I 'll have to get used to that idea .
I guess I can .
Oh , darling , don 't look so forlorn .
I know it 's gonna be hard to realize , but you and I can 't get on together .
And I do love Kurt . I stand by that .
All the same , you and I have had some good times together .
I won 't forget them .
You remember them ?
Good-bye .
Do try not to be too dreadfully lonely , will you ?
Did I remember to tell you today that I adore you ?
Anything for Dodsworth ?
What 's special delivery to Vienna ?
All right ?
I want to get in the line of excursions .
- We have a touring party for Pompeii .
- I 've been there .
There 's a beautiful drive around Mount Sorrento .
Been there too .
There 's Capri and Brugherio .
I went there yesterday .
- How would you like Pastrum ?
- What 's Pastrum ?
Greek temples , sir , in excellent preservation .
That 's more than I am .
I 'll take a chance .
Get me a car .
- How many in the party ?
- One .
Yes , sir .
Name ?
Do you remember me ?
Mrs. Cortright !
Of course .
- The steamer , Paris .
- And now Naples .
Isn 't this great ?
- Where are you staying ?
- At the Excelsior .
No , that was Rome last week .
It 's the one by the aquarium .
I think it 's the Grand .
It usually is .
Let 's sit down , if you 've got a moment .
Time is something I have nothing else but .
How 's Mrs. Dodsworth ?
I remember her with much pleasure .
She 's fine .
I haven 't got her along this trip .
- She doesn 't like traveling ?
- Does anyone ?
I expect most people travel to get away from themselves .
I 've been at it three months now .
I 'm glad to hear why .
- Alone ?
- I 'm getting used to it now .
All museums look alike .
All American Express offices look alike .
You knew I live here .
You might 've looked me up .
I 've gotten out of the way of looking folks up .
- The education , how 's that coming along ?
- I gave it up .
I found myself learning things I didn 't want to learn .
Pardon me , sir .
Your car is ready .
Hold it , will you ?
You 're busy ...
I 've got nothing to do but look at ruined temples .
They 'll keep .
They 've kept this long .
Come out to meet for lunch .
- When ?
- Anytime .
- Today ?
- Yes . Why not ?
Even if it weren 't you , if it were darn near anybody ... I 'd be so glad to have someone to talk to .
There 's a couple at my hotel , one of those really married couples .
They sit at the table next to me every night .
They never say one word to each other through dinner .
After dinner , they sit in the lounge till 10 : 00 .
Every night at 10 : 00 , the husband says to his wife , " Mary , it 's getting late . "
Just those four words .
Except for waiters and taxi drivers ...
and they don 't count ... that 's four more words than I 've said any night in the past three weeks .
I don 't want to intrude , but I 'm sorry .
I never wore these before .
Never needed them until lately .
I guess it 's a pretty ordinary story .
My wife 's younger than I am , and livelier .
I oughtn 't to confess in public .
I never did that before either .
You haven 't said anything you shouldn 't have said .
Will you go on traveling now ?
Yes .
I 've got to stay over and be on hand for the divorce .
- Where ?
- Vienna .
Well , come along .
We 'll use your car to help me do my marketing .
It 'll do you a lot more good than ruined temples .
There 's no argument there .
What would you like for lunch ?
Let 's have some good American dish .
How about some clam chowder ?
Clam chowder .
You get the clams . I 'll make the chowder .
All right .
No , no Pastrum .
The fish market .
Pietro !
Hello , boy !
- What 's his name ?
- Jinx .
Come on , Jinx !
What a wonderful spot .
Hello , Jinx .
Come on !
This is marvelous , simply wonderful .
I can 't believe it .
I simply can 't believe it .
- Fifty dollars a month for this ?
- That 's all .
- Furnished ?
- No . I picked up a few things .
- Are you hungry ?
- Starved .
- I 'll fix the clam chowder .
- She can do it ...
Yes , dress me up in my camp clothes , and I 'm a first-class chef .
How would you like to hire me ?
I 'm a good cook , a fine mechanic and a darn good fisherman .
Could you let yourself enjoy life for a while ?
Show me how .
I wonder if you could .
None of this that 's happened to me was my idea .
Break away from your hotel .
Forget about Vienna .
Move out here to me .
- Out to you ?
- Yes .
I can 't make you as comfortable as your hotel does .
When you want a bath , you 'll have to choose between the tin tub ... and the Mediterranean .
If you like swimming , fishing , a willing listener ...
That 's very kind of you and mighty friendly , but ...
I don 't see how I could .
- Why not ?
- What 'd your neighbors think ?
Being Italians , they think a great deal .
Exactly .
That doesn 't mean it would have to be so ... or that I 'd have it so even if you wanted it so .
How do you do , Baroness ?
How nice of you .
You must speak English , Mother .
Fran doesn 't yet understand German well .
We shall , of course , speak English .
But I 'm working very hard at my German , Baroness .
Do sit over here in this chair .
I think you 'll find it more comfortable .
Kurt darling , will you light a fire ?
It 's a very cold morning , isn 't it ?
There is no need to light a fire for me , Kurt .
I am not cold .
Do let me give you a cup of coffee .
I have coffee .
You see ? Kurt has taught me that much Viennese .
No , thank you .
No coffee ?
Well , then , I won 't either .
Kurt , do sit down .
You look so strained .
Really , it 's I who should feel strained , and I don 't feel that way .
I love your mother , and I hope she 's going to love me .
My mother believes we should postpone our marriage .
No , Kurt , I did not say " postpone . "
I came from the country only this morning .
We had not much time for speaking , Kurt and I ... but I 'd hoped I made myself clear to him ... when he asked my permission to marry you .
Kurt asked for permission to marry me ?
But of course .
And I 'm so sorry ... I cannot give it .
You might 've told me you 're not a free agent .
I wanted her to see you .
I knew when she saw you she would think differently .
She doesn 't seem to .
Now that you 've got so far ... perhaps you 'll tell me what it is you 've got against me .
I love your son , and I 'm really rather a nice person .
Your husband is living , Mrs. Dodsworth .
You will be divorced .
That 's not so serious , is it ?
It 's most serious to us .
I have every respect for your feelings ... but with Kurt 's happiness at stake , and yours , too ...
Perhaps it 's not my place to bring it up ... but it is an argument , so you 'll let me use it .
I 'm a person of considerable means in my own right . Enough for the three of us .
So you see ...
Yes , indeed I see .
I do not deny that we are poor since the war ... and your influence and money would be most helpful ... but even if there were not the ... religious question ...
What else is there ?
Will you leave us , Kurt ?
There is the question of children too .
Children ?
Rich or poor , Kurt should have children ... to carry on his name .
Can you give them to him ?
What makes you think I couldn 't ?
I am so much older than you are , my dear .
You will forgive if I observe that you are ... older than Kurt .
Well , children or no children , Kurt loves me and I love him .
So why shouldn 't we marry anyway and take our happiness ?
I do not know what power you have over Kurt ... but I should think of my own happiness if I were you .
I am thinking of that .
Have you thought ... how little happiness there can be ... for the ... old wife of a young husband ?
Your mother 's leaving .
Yes . I do not think there is more to say .
I am sorry if I have hurt you .
I will go now .
I will go home .
Good-bye , my dear .
I 'm very glad to ...
Good-bye .
I will just take her to a taxi .
Did she say something to hurt you , Fran ?
Please don 't be angry .
Perhaps we had better postpone our marriage for a year ... until we win her over .
What are you ?
But I must consider my mother , Fran .
We can still be married .
I 'm sure of that .
It isn 't fair .
Fran darling , please try .
I do love you , Fran .
But my mother ... My mother is waiting .
I want to put in a long-distance call .
To Naples , Italy .
Villa Cortright .
Posilipo .
I want to speak to Mr ...
Here ?
Choke .
You know ?
Choke .
You know choke ?
Hi there .
Well , I couldn 't imagine what had become of you .
Going fishing with Pietro again ?
Yeah .
I want to show him a few tricks I know .
Have you been expecting a long-distance call ?
Here ?
Heavens no .
That phone has been ringing all morning .
It doesn 't make any sense at all .
There 's that horrible putt-putt motor .
It 's been on all morning .
Yeah , he 's got the hang of it now .
Sam , that 's not my Pietro .
Pietro 's crazy about that motor .
You didn 't put it on his boat with the beautiful sail .
I bought that sail .
It 's got Santa Lucia painted on it .
I 'll have a statue of Santa Lucia made . We 'll put her on the boat holding a taillight .
Listen , don 't be hard on me .
Setting up that motor 's the first real fun I 've had since I quit business ... and it 's got me raring to go again for the first time .
- To go ?
- You bet .
- Away from here ?
- Anyplace I can get back in harness .
Something new , the way they did with automobiles when they began .
Thought I 'd try my hand at aviation .
The idea of a Moscow-to-Seattle airline kind of strikes me .
Moscow to Seattle ?
Buy in on a transcontinental connection .
With these transcontinental flights coming on so well ... I might be the first man with his first round-the-world system .
The Soviet people seem agreeable .
- Have you begun working on this ?
- Not really working .
I 'll tell you what we 'll do .
We 'll make a preliminary survey ...
- " We " ?
- I 've got my pilot staked out .
I 'll buy my own plane , and the day after the divorce ... we 'll hop off and go across ...
" We , " Sam ? " We " ?
Wait .
Where 's that map ?
Vienna ?
We were just hopping off where ?
Siberia .
Pick out landing fields . No ramifications .
A line from Irkutsk to Tashkent and Samarkand .
Swell name , Samarkand .
If those Soviet boys will let me ...
It 'll be tough on you , though . One suitcase in the coldest place .
You think you could stand it ?
- Are you taking me with you ?
- Don 't you want to go ?
All my life I 've been waiting for something exciting to happen .
I 'll fly across Siberia with you on one suitcase .
I 'll go through life with you on one suitcase , if you give me the chance .
I 've spent six short weeks with you , and I can 't imagine being without you .
I can 't imagine being without you either .
I think I must love you a great deal .
God bless you for that .
There 's Pietro .
You wanted to go fishing .
Take me with you .
- You want to go with us ?
- Yes . I want to get out of here .
- Are you coming , Sam ?
Hello ?
Yes , Fran , this is Sam .
I 'm sorry to hear that .
When are you sailing ?
All right .
I 'll get the tickets .
Well , I guess I 'll have to .
No , that 's all right .
All right .
Good-bye .
She 's dropped the divorce .
She 's going home on the Rex day after tomorrow from Naples .
I 've got to go with her .
I won 't let you .
- What else can I do ?
- I won 't let you go back to her .
I know this is a jolt .
It 's a jolt to me too .
I won 't see you killed by her selfishness .
You don 't understand .
It 'll be tough on her with all the talk there 'll be .
I love you , and she doesn 't .
You 're miserable with her .
I know .
A moment ago , you had the whole world in your hands .
- I won 't let her take it away from you .
- She 's not taking it away .
- You were a young man a minute ago ...
- I know everything 's starting again .
You shriveled the same way , every letter you got from her .
- I can 't think .
- You 're wrong to go back ...
Please , be fair .
She 's in a hole .
She needs me .
She does not need you , and you might think of me .
- I am thinking of you .
- No , I won 't make you choose .
Think of Moscow , Seattle and Samarkand .
I know .
I know every bit of it .
- One word from her , and you trot back .
- You 've got to be patient with me .
- What is this hold she has over you ?
- I 've got to take care of her .
A man 's habits get pretty strong in 20 years .
I 'll go into town and make the reservations .
It 's giving you up that hurts .
I don 't see how we managed to get such an awful cabin .
We didn 't make the reservations till yesterday .
- What are we doing here ?
- I want a drink .
You can 't get a drink till after the boat sails .
- Yes , sir .
- A brandy and soda .
The bar is closed until the boat sails .
I know , but bring a brandy and soda , and be quick about it .
Yes , sir .
You might 've asked me if I wanted something .
Do you ?
No , but if I 'm going to watch you drink ...
Somebody has to shut that door .
There 's an awful draft .
Thank you , Sammy dear .
It 's nice to be going somewhere after all these weeks .
Going home doesn 't seem so bad after all .
I was so bored in Vienna .
- Will somebody keep that door shut ?
- You can 't keep people out .
Do all these trippers have to keep popping in and out ?
- They have as much right as we have .
- That 's right , stand up for them .
But you 'll have to get my wrap .
Well , it 's closed now .
Well , if they keep it closed .
All right . Go on . You were saying ?
Oh , yes . You were right about Kurt .
I can 't think how you guessed it .
You 're not good at judging people , except in the case of businessmen .
His family may be as old as the Coliseum , but when I saw his mother ... my dear , the most awful , old country frump .
Don 't .
Sammy , please .
Don 't ride Kurt and his mother that way , that 's all .
I 'm sorry .
I 'll be good .
I didn 't expect you to defend them .
I suppose I ought to beg you to forgive me .
But you always let bygones be bygones ... and this is such a happy ending to our escapades .
All ashore go ashore !
See the hat that woman had on ?
I wonder why they allow such people in first class .
Wait until you see the clothes I bought in Vienna .
When I think of the things poor Matey Pearson puts on her back ...
You seem a little distrait , considering our reunion .
Maybe I don 't like your riding Matey that way either .
I don 't seem to be able to strike the congenial note .
I do think you might meet me halfway .
After all , as I look back , I don 't blame myself .
I can 't really .
You were a good deal at fault too .
- Steward .
- Yes , sir .
Take this check , go to suite seven on B deck ... get the suitcase with that number on it and bring it here right away .
I 'm not sailing with you .
- You 're not sailing ?
- No , I 'm not .
You and I can 't make a go of things any longer .
- This is the man I loved for 20 years .
- This is the man who 's loved you .
You haven 't learned a single thing from all our sorrows .
And I flattered myself you really wanted to come back to me .
I tried , didn 't I ?
I might 've known you 'd be just the same , yet I gave you another chance .
I 'm not taking another chance , because I 'm through , finished .
- What 's going to become of me ?
- You 'll stop getting younger someday .
Are you going back to that washed-out , expatriate in Naples ?
Yes . When I marry her , I 'm going back to doing things .
You think you 'll ever get me out of your blood ?
Maybe not , but love has gotta stop someplace short of suicide .
But the gentleman will miss the boat .
He 's gone ashore !

How much do I hear for this ?
A tea chest of red sandalwood !
Do I hear 500 ? Five hundred it is .
What do I hear for this silver vase ?
A bureau made of paulownia wood .
It 's sad , isn 't it ?
I can hardly bear it .
Seeing furniture you 've owned your whole life auctioned off like that .
We have no choice .
Our luck will turn . I know it .
Sadakichi , you 've been working here since Father 's time .
I 'm sorry things had to come to this .
No , I 'm the one who 's sorry .
I 've been with you so long , but I couldn 't prevent this .
One day we 'll work together again .
Until then , go and work for Kagiyoshi .
His store 's doing very well .
Thank you for thinking of my well-being .
Madam ... are you and Mr. Furusawa leaving for the country tomorrow ?
That 's how it looks now .
May I help you pack ?
Thank you , but I hardly need help .
I have little more than the clothes on my back .
When I came here as a bride , I never dreamt all the furniture I brought would be auctioned off .
When I left home , I had the finest dowry of anyone in town .
How can I go back and face everybody in such a pitiful state ?
How many times must you say that ?
It 's enough to make my ears ache .
I didn 't go bankrupt on purpose , you know .
Even our children will have to live in shame .
It really breaks my heart .
First you complain , then you slobber .
Why not complain to the people out there ?
Ask them why they put me out of business , why we have to sell everything you brought here as a bride .
Why don 't you do that ?
Where are you going ?
Wherever I please . I can 't stand the sight of you !
I 'm not going with you .
- Wait !
Master !
Tea and flowers .
Get your tea and flowers .
- Hot , isn 't it ?
- Ah , welcome .
How is your store ?
I 'm done for .
I 've reached the end of my rope .
Would it help if you sold something of mine ?
It 'd be a drop in the bucket .
Don 't worry yourself about it .
You 've been so good to me .
I really should repay you at a time like this .
Take anything you think might help .
That 's enough .
Just drop it .
I 'm tired of the whole thing .
Good morning , Omocha .
Welcome .
I 'll be moving in here .
I hope you don 't mind .
Is that so ?
I 'll do all your errands . I 'm at your service .
Stop joking around .
Your clothes are so sweaty .
I 'll wash them .
They should dry quickly .
Go to the public bath and forget your worries .
I think I 'll do that .
You look like a dirty old man , sweating like that .
Get going now .
- All right .
My fortunes have waned in the autumn of my years .
" A single paulownia leaf falls , a portent of autumn . "
That about sums me up .
Hurry back .
I don 't want him here .
I don 't want you letting Mr. Furusawa stay here .
How can you say that ?
I can 't just abandon him now .
So what if his shop failed ?
That 's not our concern .
Don 't talk like that .
There 's such a thing as obligation .
There 's little we can do in any case , but we should at least comfort him .
Why should we be comforting him ?
We can barely take care of ourselves .
It 's already autumn , and we only have one kimono apiece .
We 're months behind on the rent .
Anyway , I 'm not even saying this just because he 'll be an added expense .
My point is that the way you think about men is all wrong .
" Obligation " ?
Are you kidding ?
What obligation ?
It 's only fitting that he 's done things for you .
You 've made it more than worth his while .
You grew up working in the pleasure quarters .
That 's why you think that way .
But I graduated from school before becoming a geisha . I understand certain things .
Listen :
Men come here and pay money to make playthings out of us .
Is there a single exception ?
I don 't need you to tell me that .
Then act like it .
If that 's how men are , it 's only fair to find a patron and take him for all he 's worth .
Otherwise , you lose .
Yet you 'd let that penniless bum live here .
What 's he done for you that you should feel obligated ?
He helped me become a full-fledged geisha .
So you could do what ?
Any way you look at it , a geisha 's only purpose is to give men pleasure .
They pay us to be their playthings .
We 're bought and sold like common goods , and by whom ?
Men , that 's who !
Men are our enemies .
I despise them !
We should make them suffer for it .
That 's what I intend to do .
They use words like " obligation " and " duty " to confuse you .
You let men do whatever they want .
Sis , listen to me :
You should break up with him .
Do it when he comes back , and chase him out .
We can 't get along in the world talking the way you do .
Maybe you can treat men that way who only come to have fun , but not somebody who 's helped you .
Other people 's opinions count for something .
Omocha , try to understand .
What would people say if I did things your way ?
They certainly wouldn 't praise me .
So you 'll look after Mr. Furusawa just for other people 's approval ?
Have those people ever once treated us like human beings ?
Why should we care what they think ?
If you keep living this way , you 'll always feel as if you 're being strangled to death .
Look at the other geisha your age .
They all have some money saved .
- Good morning , Omocha .
Here to pray ?
Omocha , I have some good news for you .
What is it ?
There 's a man who 's crazy about you .
Who might that be ?
Mr. Kimura .
He visited this morning , didn 't he ?
The clerk from the kimono store .
Him ?
Who cares ?
Don 't say that .
Give him a favorable answer .
- Don 't be silly .
- Good-bye .
Good morning , madam .
Good morning .
I sent for you .
Did you want something ?
There 's a banquet on the fifth of next month , and you wanted your sister to perform in it .
You 'd really let her take part ?
Yes .
But there 's something I can 't tell her , so I 'm telling you .
She 's perfect as a geisha , but does she have a proper kimono ?
It 's a high-class affair , so it would be embarrassing not to go in a nice kimono .
It would hurt my reputation too .
What reputation ?
She wrings every last penny out of second-rate geishas like us .
What gall .
Please do let her take part .
I will , as long as she has a nice kimono .
We 'll figure something out .
If my sister doesn 't find a patron ,
I hate to think what will become of her .
I agree .
Madam , just listen to this .
It really makes my blood boil .
You know that Mr. Furusawa ?
- Whose store went bankrupt ?
Yes .
He came by this morning , asking us to put him up .
Sorry to make you look after the house .
It 's a wonder a little mouse didn 't run off with you .
" You 're late , jail keeper . "
" It is my fault for being late , my man . "
I 'm dead tired .
- Some tea ?
Thank you .
I bought some serge for a kimono .
Do you think it will suit you ?
Very nice .
I 'll put that Kabuki star Tanjuro to shame .
It 's about time to wear warmer clothes .
Sorry to trouble you .
I brought you some of your favorite : Eel and burdock .
It looks good .
Delicious .
- It is , isn 't it ?
I 'll set the table . Wait just a moment .
Thanks .
Thank you for your order .
Thanks for coming .
Your money .
- Thank you .
I 'm terribly sorry , but could I pay you next time ?
The boss is really strict .
Please don 't forget next time .
What a nuisance !
- Good day .
- Oh , hello .
Good to see you again .
How 's business , Mr. Kimura ?
Not bad , madam .
Your shop has a bright future .
- I 'm not so sure .
- Mr. Kimura ?
Hello , Omocha .
You 're terrible .
What did I do ?
You were talking to Umeryu about me , weren 't you ?
You heard about that ?
- I 'll say I did .
- I 'm sorry .
Sweet on each other , are you ?
Of course not .
- Just don 't seduce her now .
- What a thing to say !
I mean it .
- Mr. Kimura .
- Yes ?
I need a new kimono next month .
Do you have anything nice ?
- For autumn wear ?
- Yes .
I have plenty , since I 'm on my way to Hanamikoji .
Let me see them .
I 'll take one .
But they 're expensive .
I 'm not sure what I can do .
In the price range you can afford , rayon might be a better choice .
But we don 't sell them , so you 'd have to ask around .
Why are you being so cold ?
You were lying when you told Umeryu you liked me , right ?
No , it 's the truth .
I don 't believe it .
I 'd be so happy if you really meant it .
Mr. Kimura ... my sister needs a special kimono for a high-class party .
Couldn 't you please give her one ?
That 's a lot to ask .
Listen , Mr. Kimura , just pretend you 're making it for me .
Don 't ask that of a poor man like me .
Ask your patron for it .
Idiot .
If I had a patron , I wouldn 't be coming to you .
I 'd be asking him for lots of clothes .
Then hook a rich patron .
You mean man !
So you didn 't really mean it .
What a fool I 've been .
I can 't believe I took you at your word .
If that 's how you feel ,
I 'll find myself a lot of patrons .
I 'd prefer that anyway .
I was just joking .
Tell me what you want .
Don 't bother . I don 't want anything now .
If you really do like me , I 'll see what I can do about a kimono .
You really are dumb .
Where are your eyes ?
You can tell how a girl feels by how she acts .
I can 't tell unless you make it clear .
I really can 't .
You 're hopeless .
What a pretty design !
I 'll take this .
That costs 53 yen .
That 's the best I have with me today .
It 's 53 yen .
- I heard you the first time .
I 've been watching you .
You look so young , I didn 't recognize you .
You and your jokes .
Say , yesterday I went to Mr. Furusawa 's place to bid in the auction , but I was told he wasn 't at home .
Is that why you 're looking so young ?
Is he at your place ?
Could be .
I can tell just by looking when it 's the real thing .
You can 't fool me .
- You 're quite right .
- Really ?
- It 's getting hot in here .
- Cut it out .
Where 's Shimbei Furusawa 's house ?
Please be careful .
Oh , my !
Who is it ?
It 's Mr. Jurakudo .
We got to talking about you , and he insisted on seeing you .
I 'm glad you came by .
Long time no see , Jurakudo .
Furusawa !
I just had to see you .
He 's had too much to drink .
It 's terrible what 's happened .
I went to the auction yesterday .
I swear , tears were streaming from my eyes .
This scroll , that scroll - all ones I had sold you .
I never dreamt I 'd be buying them back .
I just wept and wept .
I didn 't care who saw me .
You know how I feel ?
Do you ?
He 's dead drunk , isn 't he ?
Dead drunk ?
What a cruel thing to say .
You think I 'm drunk and talking nonsense ?
- No , I understand .
- Honestly ?
I understand . Thanks for your tears of concern .
My , what an amusing man .
Who are you ?
What a beauty !
- Careful .
- You 'll hurt yourself .
- Don 't be so reckless .
- Who are you ?
This is my younger sister .
Please be nice to her .
Your sister ?
I didn 't know you had such a beautiful sister .
Let 's have a drink .
Pour me a drink , doll .
Not you !
If you poured , the sake would lose its taste .
Have it your way , playboy .
Would you do me a favor , Jurakudo ?
What kind of favor ?
- Lend me some pocket money .
- How much do you want ?
Thirty yen will do .
That 's too much .
Make it 20 .
Don 't be stingy .
How things have changed .
Shimbei Furusawa , owner of one of the largest dry goods stores in Kyoto , is asking little old me for spending money .
How pitiful to see a man down on his luck .
What are you saying ?
You sold me a lot of imitation scrolls and cheap chinaware .
What did you just say ?
Repeat that .
You trying to give me a bad name ?
Are you saying I sold you fakes ?
That I sell phony antiques ?
Fine , never mind .
It was so sad .
I went to the auction to bid ... and I wept .
I know .
- This scroll and that scroll -
- Never mind . I was just joking .
Joking ?
Of course you were .
I 'm no phony .
- Of course not .
- You understand ?
Okay , as long as you understand .
There 's a lot in there .
Is this enough ?
Wait a minute .
Be careful .
The sake 's really getting to him .
I 'll see him home .
- You will ?
Where does he live ?
- Sanneizaka in Kiyomizu .
- I see .
Mr. Jurakudo .
Driver , please go back to Shimokiya Street .
Are you awake now ?
Who are you ?
You really were drunk , weren 't you ?
You forced me to come here , remember ?
I did ?
Who are you ?
Omocha , Umekichi 's sister .
Umekichi has a sister like you ?
And what are you and I doing here together ?
Just listen to yourself !
We went from the party to Umekichi 's place ...
That 's right .
I saw Mr. Furusawa , didn 't I ?
- Yes , you did .
I see .
I certainly got drunk , didn 't I ?
This is Shimokiya Street , isn 't it ?
Have a drink .
Don 't be silly .
What time is it ?
A little past 10 : 00 .
Past 10 : 00 ?
I have to get home .
Please wait just a moment .
I want to talk to you .
- About what ?
My sister wants to talk to you about something .
If it 's for pocket money , the answer is no .
Mr. Jurakudo , what do you think of my sister ?
Think of her ?
Don 't ask such questions .
- Don 't you like her ?
- What are you talking about ?
Oh , well ... forget it then .
Hold on .
Don 't jump to conclusions .
She can 't stop talking about you , you know .
Don 't try to flatter me .
She talks about how kind you are , and how lucky a woman would be to have a patron like you .
- Is that true ?
- Why would I lie ?
Let 's have a drink .
That may well be , but your sister has Mr. Furusawa .
That 's just the point .
He was her patron , but there 's nothing between them now .
But she feels obligated to look after him because he helped her in the past .
I 'll be perfectly frank :
My sister finds him a burden now .
Of course she does .
Who wants to be shackled to an old man like him ?
He was rich before ...
- Yes .
But he hasn 't got a penny now .
He 'll pull her down with him and make her poor too .
You 're exactly right .
Sorry to keep you waiting .
May I bring you something ?
Bring us your best food .
And more sake .
- Right away , sir .
My sister says if you agree to look after her , it 'll make it hard for Mr. Furusawa to hang on , and he 'll be forced to leave .
Please try to imagine what it 's like for her .
But it puts me in a difficult position .
Why ?
Why ?
I used to do business with him .
I 'm indebted to him myself .
But I 'd certainly be willing if she breaks up with him .
I can help out if you give me some money .
Money so they can break up ?
- Yes .
He 's so poor , he can 't even go to his in-laws in the country .
How much do you need ?
It 'll take more than just pocket change .
- How 's 100 yen ?
- Perfect .
This is for your sister 's sake .
Give it to him right away .
It 's not for her sake , it 's for yours .
You don 't mince words , do you ?
- I 'm home .
- Welcome back .
- I 'm exhausted .
- Did you see him home safely ?
Thank you .
- He was so drunk , it wasn 't easy .
Sorry about that .
Are you hungry ?
Shall I order some udon ?
Thanks , but I 've eaten .
This is for you .
- Thank you .
Have it with your sake .
I 'll have some now .
This is my favorite .
How about a drink ?
Have another .
Don 't hold back .
What service !
- Mr. Furusawa ...
- What is it ?
You won 't like what I 'm about to say , but please don 't be angry .
What is it ?
I think you can guess , can 't you ?
As I 'm sure you realize , your staying here is a burden on us .
Yes , I know .
You two were in the red again last month .
Geishas really don 't make much , do they ?
I feel for you .
We barely scrape by .
Besides , we live in a fishbowl , and people love to talk .
Everyone 's gossiping about your being here .
Very true .
We 've taken you in out of love and loyalty , but other people don 't see it that way .
Of course , my sister can 't tell you the truth .
Please forgive me , but I raised some money .
Here 's 50 yen .
You can use it to go back to your hometown .
Sorry to put you to so much trouble .
Thank you for taking it so well .
I guess I 'll be going .
I see that your misfortunes have made you very understanding .
Give Umekichi my regards .
Yes , I will .
Take good care of yourself .
Learn your fortune .
Your luck in love .
Master !
Who 's that ?
If it isn 't Sadakichi !
It 's been so long !
How 's business with you lately ?
Where have you been ?
Everyone 's been worried .
Your wife was very angry and returned to the country .
Where are you staying ?
Some people were putting me up , but I 've just been kicked out .
- Then go back to your wife .
- Forget it .
I 've got money tonight .
Let 's go have a few drinks .
Sure , but let 's go to my place first .
Forget that .
Let 's just go .
Roasted chestnuts !
I 'm back .
Where 's Mr. Furusawa ?
He 's not here anymore .
- Not here ?
Why ?
- I don 't know .
He left as if he 'd suddenly remembered something .
He left ?
I didn 't say anything .
I didn 't say you did .
I don 't know anything .
What do you think ?
Even an expert couldn 't tell this from the real thing .
Well done , isn 't it ?
What 's your best price ?
Well , let 's see . It certainly is well made . How about 170 yen ?
Excuse me .
Please come sit down .
I 'll wait , thanks .
I made a mistake . It 's actually 270 yen .
Can 't you knock off 100 yen ?
I 'm hardly making a profit as it is .
Perhaps you can buy it next time .
All right , I 'll take it .
Really ?
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Please come again .
Have a seat .
- Thanks .
How did it go ?
He left .
It was easier than I thought .
It was actually embarrassing .
Sort of anticlimactic , really .
You naughty girl .
How 's Umekichi ?
Very happy , and looking forward to living with you .
- Is that so ?
- But there 's a little hitch .
You mustn 't mention Mr. Furusawa .
I 'd hate things to get fouled up .
And don 't ask her if she loves you .
Real men don 't , you know .
I understand .
I won 't bungle things .
Can I see her soon ?
- Just remember what I told you .
Add this up for yourself .
Think you can fool me like this ?
I thought you 'd been acting strange lately .
Is this what you 've been up to ?
If you want to deceive people , you 'll have to try harder .
What do you think will happen if you keep this up ?
Tell me : What did you need that much money for ?
Spit it out .
So you can 't tell me ?
Of course not .
Then I 'll tell you : Some geisha wheedled you into making a kimono for her .
Well ?
Am I right ?
Don 't be the kind of sop who has to buy a woman 's love .
When I was young , it was the girls who bought me things .
What 's this geisha like ?
Any woman you love is probably no good anyway .
If she 's actually willing to marry you , I 'll act as your go-between .
Tell me who she is , and I 'll look into it .
Omocha .
Something terrible has happened .
- What ? I 'm in trouble . My boss found out .
What are you so worked up about ?
- I may get fired .
- Really ?
If my boss comes here , please cover for me .
Don 't expect me to get you out of trouble .
Don 't say that . Please .
He even said he 'd help us get married , so come up with a good story .
- Me , marry you ?
- Yes .
Don 't make me laugh .
Please don 't mess this up .
- Excuse me .
- Welcome .
And who may you be ?
The name 's Kudo .
I run the Marubishi store .
Thank you for your business .
Oh , so you run the store ?
Are you Omocha ?
Yes . May I help you ?
I 'd like a word with you .
Is that so ?
Please come in .
Thank you .
- Please .
- Pardon the intrusion .
I 'll get to the point :
I 'm here to talk about Kimura .
He says he made a kimono for Umekichi . Is that true ?
Oh , that ?
That was some time ago .
How can you be so nonchalant about it ?
You live in the pleasure quarters .
Surely you understand that a clerk in a fabric store can 't just give away kimono fabric costing over 50 yen .
- How would I know that ?
- You can 't be serious .
You knew , and yet you -
Don 't be silly !
I asked him if it was really all right , if it wouldn 't get him fired .
He said not to worry , that he was paying .
No , he 's been with me since he was a small boy . I know him very well .
He 's honest to a fault .
Really ?
Honest ?
Trying to seduce a poor girl with a single kimono - is that honest ?
Is that what he did ?
It 's partly my own fault .
If I were a popular geisha , I wouldn 't have to accept gifts from such a man .
But I don 't have a patron , so it 's hard to buy even a single kimono .
That 's why I accepted his offer .
A pretty girl like you , not popular ?
It 's true . I 'm at my wits ' end .
I 'd like a patron to look after me , but I can 't find one .
No one to look after you ?
Those men must all be blind .
You flatter me .
I wish it were true .
But it is .
It 's been so nice talking to you that I forgot to offer tea .
No , don 't bother .
If I could only find a patron , I 'd love him with all my heart .
Please come and drink .
Have some of this instead of tea . No one 's home now .
Please come over here .
You sure ? Don 't mind if I do .
- Please .
- If you insist .
So you and your sister live here together ?
Yes . We both work so hard , but it 's hopeless .
All the more reason not to get involved with a penniless clerk like Kimura .
But I don 't know anyone else .
You must know many fine men . Please find a patron for me .
I don 't know a single man with any sense .
That can 't be true .
Still , younger men are really undependable .
And they don 't listen when you try to talk seriously .
Young men are no good . They haven 't suffered .
You 're right .
A man like you knows the bitter and the sweet .
I 'd like to tell you about myself sometime .
I 'd be happy to listen .
I 'm so glad !
I 'm really so glad !
If only someone like you would take care of me , I 'd really be thrilled .
You 're just saying that to make an old man happy .
No , I really mean it .
I 've decided I want you to take care of me .
What do you say ?
- Well ...
- Take this thing off .
- But ...
Are you in a rush ?
No , I 'm free today .
You 'll be more comfortable in this .
This seems too good to be true .
What a thing to say !
- Where 's the boss ?
- Not back yet .
- Really ?
- Yes .
Welcome back , sir .
- Yasukichi .
- Yes , sir ?
Come with me .
Welcome back .
Forget about her .
You can find any number like her .
How about finding a geisha with some sense ?
I 'm sorry , sir .
I 'll let you off this time , but try to behave yourself in the future .
I 'll handle our clients in the pleasure quarters from now on .
Is that clear ?
Stay away from girls like that .
I 'm just thinking of your future .
If I find out you 're still seeing her , I won 't be as forgiving next time .
I 'm sorry .
I 'll be very careful .
- Is that clear ?
- Yes . I 'm very sorry .
That girl sweet-talked her way into your pockets , didn 't she ?
Nonsense .
Why do you have to be such a chatterbox ?
There 's no telling what you 'll do .
Sister , take a look .
How do I look ?
Play your cards right and we can live like this .
Buy whatever we want , live in luxury .
Right ?
You won 't get anywhere acting like that .
Still hustling for a living at your age .
What did Mr. Jurakudo say ?
He wants a definite answer today .
Excuse me .
Well , well .
Mr. Jurakudo .
Well ?
- It 's okay .
- Really ?
She 's been waiting for you .
Come in .
- Thanks .
Welcome .
Sister , now 's the time .
You mustn 't pressure her .
Have some tea .
Thanks .
Have you thought it over ?
Yes .
Ring , ring , ring Nothing left to do but die
That 's the only way out
The only end to all this suffering and grief
Ring , ring , ring
Though I know it would make you unhappy
Hello , Mr. Furusawa .
How 's everything ?
Same as usual , thanks .
Aren 't you staying with Umekichi ?
No , I 'm staying here now , at my clerk 's house .
Is that so ?
I was thinking of going over there .
Can I give them a message for you ?
You 're on your way there ?
I 'd better not .
In that case , please excuse me .
Good day .
What happened ?
We haven 't seen you lately .
No , my boss is making the rounds now .
He told me not to come around here , so I haven 't been by .
Is that so ?
How do you do .
Umekichi .
What happened to you and Mr. Furusawa ?
Did you two quarrel ?
I just saw him a while ago .
What ?
Mr. Furusawa ?
Where did you see him ?
- You don 't know where he is ?
- No . - At a teashop in Yasakashita .
- Yasakashita ?
Yes , at the home of his former clerk .
He was pushing a baby cart and singing Bunraku lyrics , as always .
Hold on -
What else ?
It made me sad to see him reduced to that after living in such high style .
It really makes you stop and think .
Umekichi , what 's the matter ?
What was all that about ?
Don 't be rash .
What are you doing ?
Please don 't stop me . Please leave me alone .
It 's all beyond me .
What 's good today ?
I can 't understand a damn word on this menu .
You go ahead and pick something good .
- What 's the matter ?
- I forgot my wallet . Your wallet ?
That was careless of you .
Omocha ?
What are you doing here ?
You idiot !
After all I said , you still don 't understand ?
Go home !
What about you , boss ?
You reprimanded me , but just look at you .
What 's going on here ?
How dare you talk like that to your boss !
That 's it .
You 're fired .
I want you out of my store .
If you 're still there when I get back , you 'll regret it .
Fool !
Omocha , don 't tell me he 's your -
- Yes , he 's my patron .
- Your patron ?
How can you say that to my face , you tramp !
Tramp ? Fine by me .
I 'm a geisha .
If I always told the truth , I 'd be out of business .
Sometimes I have to lie .
What are you doing ?
He thinks I 'm his woman because of one lousy kimono .
He 's pathetic .
- That 's enough .
You 'd better watch out .
Try that again and you 'll be arrested .
She 's right .
So now the truth comes out .
Remember this day .
You too , boss .
You got that ?
Quit grumbling and get out !
I 'm leaving .
But remember , Omocha :
I 'm a man too . Oh , I won 't forget . And such a fine man too .
Get out of here !
How stupid can he be ?
Oh , there it is .
Why did you just leave like that ?
How could you not know how I feel ?
Don 't be silly .
Do I look like such a heartless man ?
I was told you didn 't want me around , so I left .
Who said such a thing ?
Omocha .
So it was her !
She told you to leave ?
I had a feeling that was it .
Why would she do such a thing ?
But even if she did , why did you leave without a word ?
I thought you didn 't want me .
If I didn 't want you , would I suffer so ?
I 'm glad to hear you say that .
Does Omocha really hate me that much ?
How about moving in here with me ?
If you don 't mind , I will .
I don 't want to live with a sister who 'd do such a thing to you .
We can relax here .
Just the two of us .
That makes me very happy .
But you say that now . Are you sure you won 't leave me again ?
Of course not .
How could I leave you by yourself ?
You 're just saying that .
Excuse me . I 'd like to use your phone .
What 's that ?
- Please let me make a call . - Okay .
Kimura ?
What ?
Don 't tell such silly lies .
I 'm not lying .
That 's right .
Thank you for everything .
What 's that ?
Is this true ?
Yes , it 's the truth .
I saw your husband at a nice place in the Gion .
That 's why I was fired .
The Gion ?
Where ?
The house of the geisha who swindled me .
I saw what a fine patron your husband is to Omocha .
I can 't set foot in the store again .
Good-bye .
And give your husband my regards .
Welcome back .
Listen , has Yasukichi Kimura come back here ?
No , sir , he isn 't back yet .
I see .
Welcome back .
I 'm back .
Welcome home , sir .
Omasa , I brought you a treat from the Gion .
I 've been so busy . One thing after another .
Busy all the time .
What 's the matter ?
Don 't you feel well ?
- Don 't come near me .
- Why ? Otake !
Is the bath ready ?
- In a moment , ma 'am .
This isn 't fit to eat . Give it to the dog .
What are you doing ?
Stop acting like this .
I 'm an idiot all right .
What are you so angry about ?
Stop taking me for a fool .
Where were you just now ?
At a customer 's place .
Are you telling the truth ?
Enough already . This is foolishness .
Are you still fooling around at your age ?
Welcome back .
Mr. Jurakudo must have been very pleased .
I 'm moving out .
Whatever for ?
Mr. Furusawa told me everything .
You saw him ?
I 'll send for my things later .
Sister !
Sister , wait !
How can she be such a fool ?
Good evening .
Is Omocha in ?
- Yes .
What is it ?
Mr. Kudo has sent the car for you .
He has ?
Please wait a moment .
How 's business , Omocha ?
Wanna have some fun ?
What ? Don 't get familiar with me .
Don 't get familiar ?
I know all about you .
Didn 't you swindle that kimono from a clerk ?
Be quiet !
As beautiful as you are , you still have to hustle for a patron .
I feel sorry for you .
How dare you act so smug with me !
Stop it !
Where is Mr. Kudo anyway ?
Mr. Kudo ?
He 's too stingy . Forget about him .
I 'll find you a filthy-rich playboy .
If you 'd prefer a younger man , how about me ?
I 'd like that .
Or how about him ?
Enough insults !
I 'm not that kind of woman !
Don 't give me that . I know better .
You 'll do anything for money .
Just be quiet and come along .
You idiot ! Who do you think you are ?
Why are you doing this ?
Omocha , long time no see .
This is what you 've brought me to .
I 'm going to get everything off my chest .
- Mr. Kimura ! - I 'm a bitter man .
You 're going to get what you deserve .
- Let me out !
- You 're not going anywhere .
I said let me out !
We 're not going to eat you .
Just come along quietly .
Let me out !
Something terrible has happened !
Your sister 's been badly hurt .
Omocha ?
Yes . A doctor just phoned .
This is terrible .
Go see her right away .
What could have happened ?
No point in staying here and worrying .
Hurry and go see her .
I 'll be back soon .
If you need anything , I 'll come right over .
Umekichi .
What happened , madam ?
It may have been a case of revenge .
She was thrown from a taxicab .
Is she very badly hurt ?
I just hope she isn 't left crippled .
It 's that bad ?
Where is she now ?
- The doctor 's seeing her .
- Will she be okay ?
- Let 's hope so .
Omocha , what happened ?
Are you in pain ?
This is what happens when you treat men like that .
Terrible things happen .
Something like this won 't make me give in to men .
Any man who does this to a geisha simply because she refuses him is a coward .
I 'll make him pay .
Don 't say such things .
Let this be a lesson to you .
You have to consider people 's feelings .
If you 'd listened , this wouldn 't have happened .
No , your way means giving in to men . I refuse to do that !
Why would anyone want to give in to them ?
You mustn 't get worked up .
That 's right . You mustn 't talk like that .
You must be quiet , understand ?
Be a good girl .
May I have a word with you ?
I 'd like to go get my things . Would you stay until I return ?
- Don 't be long .
- I won 't . Thank you .
Did he go out ?
Mr. Furusawa ?
He just got a telegram from his wife .
A telegram ?
He and my husband left very suddenly for Mrs. Furusawa 's home in the country .
It seems Mr. Furusawa will manage a factory there .
Really ?
Did he leave a message for me ?
He didn 't leave a letter , but he said to tell you to find a better patron .
How could he say that ?
It is strange , isn 't it ?
Umekichi , I feel cold .
Could you pull the other blanket over me ?
What 's the matter ?
Why the long face ?
What 's wrong ?
What happened ?
Mr. Furusawa left suddenly for the country without telling me .
I told you so .
No matter how much we do for men , they abandon us when it suits them .
I don 't mind .
It 's all right with me .
I did everything I could for him , and I 'm sure I brought him happiness .
I can face the world with my head held high .
And where has it gotten you ?
You can hold your head high , but what has anyone done for you ?
Mr. Furusawa may be happy , but what about you ?
Are you living a life of ease ?
You meekly did as you were told and got nothing in return .
If we do our jobs well , they call us immoral .
So what can we do ?
What are we supposed to do ?
Why do we have to suffer like this ?
Why do there even have to be such things as geisha ?
Why does the world need such a profession ?
It 's so unfair .
I wish they never existed !
I wish they never existed !
THE END
Translation by KERIM YASAR for SUBTEXT SUBTITLING
Diana ?
Yes , Mother Rukh .
Janos is still in the laboratory , of course ?
Yes .
He 's checking his equipment before the people from England arrive .
I 'm to let him know when I see the lights of the car .
It was on such a night that Janos first caught his ray from Andromeda .
Your father worked the guides ,
I held the detecting lens and never saw again .
Dear Mother Rukh .
My son will not learn until too late , I fear , that the universe is very large , and there are some secrets we are not meant to probe .
Janos says the electricity will help the demonstration .
He is wrong to demonstrate to these people .
Who are they ?
Pigmies that scoff at a giant , who have said that he is only a visionary , unscientific , a charlatan .
Huh .
He 's greater than all of them .
He sent for them .
If he had waited , one day they would have begged , begged to come to him .
I see the car now .
I 'll tell Janos .
Janos ?
Janos ?
Diana .
They are coming up the grade .
Sir Francis Stevens and the great Dr. Benet from the University of Paris .
What do they know ?
What will they ever know ?
I 'll take them somewhere they have never been .
Back into time .
It will work well tonight .
I 'm sure and I 'm ready .
They 'll never laugh at me again .
Janos .
They 'll be here any minute .
You must prepare to meet them .
Come .
Yes .
Yes .
I 'm Diana Rukh .
My husband will be here presently .
I 'm Lady Stevens .
This is my husband , Sir Francis .
How do you do ?
And this is Dr. Benet .
Madame .
How do you do ?
And this is my nephew , Ronald Drake .
How do you do ?
May I present you to my husband 's mother , Frau Rukh ?
How do you do ?
Oh , what a lovely fire .
I hope you didn 't have too bad a time coming up .
It really is rather a terrible trip .
Oh , I don 't mind anything , but my poor sit-downish husband minded it .
Brandy ?
Oh , thanks .
That will help .
Thank you .
Would anyone ever expect to find anything like this on top of the Carpathian Mountain ?
No .
Sir Francis .
To see you again after so many years is interesting .
Dr. Benet , we meet at last .
But we already know each other .
True .
You 've come to see me fail , but you 'll be disappointed .
I have come to see that Sir Francis isn 't deceived .
Your doubts are very flattering .
They are mutual .
We have never seen eye to eye .
That is because I 've always looked 200 years ahead of your theories .
Dr. Rukh ?
You haven 't met me .
Lady Stevens .
Nor my nephew , Ronald Drake .
And you too are a scientist , sir ?
No , I 'm afraid not .
He doesn 't know a thing about science .
But he 's one of the three living men who crossed the mountains of the moon , made maps of the country .
And since that 's where we 're going , he 'll come in useful .
Very commendable work , sir .
Good man .
I 've seen him tested in Africa .
I read that you were going to Africa .
That 's why I asked you here .
Because what I have to show you after dinner concerns Africa , and the claim I made many years ago .
All of this makes a man like me feel quite small and useless .
But you 've gone into uncharted places , too .
Oh , my explorations have all been on this planet .
They reach into space .
This is the nebula in Andromeda .
A ray from this nebula will be caught here and electrically transferred to the projector in my laboratory .
There I will recreate what is recorded on that beam of light .
From Andromeda ?
From Andromeda .
Three-quarters of a million light-years distant .
Can he do that ?
Yes .
He will not fail .
He must not .
It would kill him .
Have you seen it ?
No one has seen it , but Janos .
You 'll wait here a few minutes .
I 'll prepare the projector .
He seems very confident .
Yes .
Of course , the theory of reproducing vibrations from the past is not new .
But if proved , would be .
Yes .
This may be very interesting .
Yes .
Very .
Doesn 't all this sort of thing ever affect you ?
Oh , no .
I 'm used to it .
My father was assistant here .
When he died three years ago , I married Dr. Rukh .
Oh , I see .
I am ready .
A new development of barium crown glass which will protect you from all dangerous rays .
To reproduce what is written upon the beam from Andromeda , we must travel out into space upon that ray of light until we reach a point at which we turn and look back upon our own planet .
We approach the moon .
Dead ashes , where there is no air or water .
In the shadows , colder than our Arctic .
In the sunlight , hotter than any desert of the Earth .
Saturn we pass , with its twirling rings .
A vast cloud of tiny movements , each moving in its own orbit .
Another constellation speeds towards us .
The great nebula of Orion .
Five hundred light-years distant .
But we travel at a speed far greater than light , the pace of electric magnification .
Otherwise it will take a million lifetimes to reach our goal .
We move by this chaotic mass and see Andromeda .
Our nearest neighbor among the island universes of space .
The light which we see left there before man existed , before our Earth had cooled .
We speed towards this nebula and stop at a point where we will see our own planet , the Earth , as it existed long ago .
Years ago , Sir Francis , I voiced a belief that a great meteor bearing an element even more powerful than radium , struck an uncharted spot somewhere in the continent of Africa .
If you will bear with me for a moment ,
I 'll show you how I know this to be a fact .
That is all .
A trick ?
No .
Reality .
But where has it gone ?
Back into space .
What did we see ?
What you saw tonight actually occurred a few thousand million years ago .
I see .
A tour in time .
Exactly .
Everything that ever happened has left its record on nature 's film .
Every sound since eternity began still vibrates , recorded somewhere in outer space .
The cataclysm you witnessed tonight traveled back to us on the ray from Andromeda .
Well , I 'm dazed .
Dazed , that 's all I can say .
You have demonstrated something that I have always regarded as an unsupported theory .
I 'm at a loss for words .
I congratulate you .
Perhaps you 'd all like some brandy .
Oh , thank you .
That would be most acceptable .
I 'll join you in a few moments .
Well , I , for one , am just beginning to recover from what we 've seen .
I don 't think I ever shall .
It was unbelievable .
Well , sir , your discovery is breathtaking .
When do you plan to release it to the world of science ?
Oh , not for some time .
It 's not nearly ready yet .
And if there should be this meteoric deposit of an unknown element in Africa ...
There is .
It 'd be interesting to discover what it is .
Very .
Will you consider joining forces with us and accompany our expedition ?
You ask me to join forces with you ?
But you forget I have no standing with your scientific congress .
I believe I have even been called unorthodox .
Oh , nonsense .
Our expedition isn 't under the auspices of any association .
You will be doing us an honor .
Yes , I 'll go with you .
Why not ?
No , Janos .
But why ?
It will not be wise for you to go .
I 'm listening , Mother .
Even though you may make a great discovery , you 'll not be happy .
You are not used to people , Janos .
You never will be .
Your experiments are your friends .
Leave people alone .
Where do you suppose that madman Rukh is , anyway ?
After all , it is his own business if he wishes to go off on an exploration of his own .
See , Stevens , the little creature is going to live .
See his flesh glow .
He moves his arm with much more strength .
Very interesting .
This proves , I think that human organisms are only part of astro-chemistry , controlled by radial forces from the sun .
Oh , I never doubted your theory .
Uh , what have you been using ?
Zithilium .
One milligram , drawn directly from the spectrum of the sun .
Turn it off .
Interesting .
But I must admit I 'm quite ready to leave Africa the moment that your experiments are completed .
After eight weeks of this , I admit that I 'm fed up .
I know every wheeze and every crack of every record .
Glad to see signs of rhino about .
We 'll go out after them tomorrow .
Yes .
You 've only got six to your credit .
Oh , well , they 're such nasty-tempered beasts , it is a pleasure to dispose of them .
This must be lonely for Diana .
Of course .
It 's your fault .
Why do you say that ?
Oh , Ronnie , the way you two avoid each other is most pointed .
Why can 't you be pleasantly friendly with her as you were at first ?
Well , if you must know , I don 't dare to be .
Becoming interested ?
Yes .
I thought so .
You 're in love .
Well , what could be more natural ?
An African moon , two healthy young animals ...
Oh , stop it .
We 're not animals .
And that 's just it .
And it isn 't too easy , so please don 't make us into fiction for your book .
Well , you are interested .
Oh , so you 're back , Arabella .
Yes .
We got an antelope and a fine leopard .
My ankles are worse .
I tell you , I 'm getting heartily sick of Africa .
And I don 't see any use in waiting for Rukh any longer .
It 's evident he has elected to desert us .
Well , we can 't go and leave his wife here alone , even though he 's forgotten she came along .
After all , she is Rukh 's affair , not ours .
She is my affair .
I 'm fond of her .
Well , I 'm not fond enough of anyone to make this my permanent abode .
Temba , more water , please .
Choco .
The small package .
Boss , put on hat .
Very hot here .
Boss found place he look for many days now , maybe ?
There 's no doubt of it .
No doubt of it .
Safari boys no like this place , boss .
Why not ?
Look in pit , fall in , many devil .
Pick me out a runner .
I want to send a letter to the main camp immediately .
Me do .
This boy go .
He very fast .
Hold box .
How long will he take to reach the main camp ?
This time tomorrow night , he get there .
All downhill .
Good .
Boss , wants him to wait , bring back answer paper ?
Yes .
Now , give this to the young mistress .
Don 't say a word about where we are .
And make sure he understands .
Francis , are you asleep ?
No , my dear , I was merely trying to imagine myself at home .
I 'd give £ 10 for ...
Antelope stew again .
Take it away .
I 'm not up to coping with it .
Oh , stop feeling so sorry for yourself .
What new secrets did you draw from the sun today , Dr. Benet ?
Proof that the sun is the mother of us all .
Is she ?
I wonder why she bothers about us .
What are we all about anyway ?
Astro-chemistry , my friend .
Astro-chemistry .
It 's from Janos .
Excuse me .
He says very little .
We 're not to expect him back for some time .
Where is he ?
He doesn 't say .
He hopes he is on the trail of an interesting new discovery .
Runner boy want take paper back .
Yes , tell him to wait .
Will you all excuse me , please ?
But your dinner , dear ?
I 'm not really hungry .
I want to see the runner boy in my tent .
You come , too , and talk for me .
I 'll be ready in an hour .
I want three boys for safari .
Diana ?
What are you going to do ?
There 's only one thing to do .
I 'm going to him tonight .
Tonight ?
It 's cooler .
Besides , there 's a moon .
You 're going alone ?
I can 't stay here now .
Why ?
He 's a great man , Ronald .
I 'm his wife .
He needs me .
And I can 't let him down .
No .
You wouldn 't .
You 're not the sort to let any man down .
Ever .
Goodbye .
Goodbye , Diana .
Power .
More power than man has ever known .
Well , what do you want ?
Safari boys want go away this place .
No like him .
So , they want to leave me , do they ?
Me wanna go , too .
Indeed .
Do you see that rock ?
Yes , boss .
I want you to keep your eyes on that rock .
Tell the boys to do so , too .
Watch .
You can all go if you want to , but you won 't go far .
All that will be left of you will be like that .
Me stay , boss .
We 'll all stay .
All right .
Then get back to work .
Take the lamp inside .
Draws the pests .
It 's poisoned me .
Dead .
Boss house there .
Me take you .
No , I 'll go alone .
Janos ?
What are you doing here ?
You must go away at once .
At once .
Do you hear ?
But it 's Diana .
You shouldn 't have come .
I wrote you I had important work to do .
I don 't want to be bothered with anyone .
Oh , you must be ill .
What 's happened to you ?
Nothing has happened to me .
What makes you think anything has happened to me ?
It 's been weeks since you left .
Don 't you want to see me ?
I don 't want to see you here .
This is no place for you .
You must leave here at once .
My place is where you are .
I won 't be a bother .
I suppose you 'll have to stay the night .
My headman will find shelter for you .
But I want you out of here the very first thing in the morning .
Do you understand ?
Yes .
I understand .
I 'm leaving as soon as it 's daybreak .
Yes , missy .
Me tell your boys .
Thank you .
Benet .
Benet .
Rukh ?
Don 't let anybody know I 'm here .
You 're exhausted .
Don 't touch me .
What has happened ?
I made the runner guide me here .
I 've traveled day and night .
But why ?
I found the place where the meteor fell .
I 've discovered an element a thousand times more powerful than radium .
But it 's done something to me .
Something horrible .
Horrible ?
Look at me .
Look at me in the dark .
Why , you 're poisoned .
Poisoned .
And everyone I touch is poisoned .
They die .
Die ?
Yes .
I know .
Let 's get back into the light .
Perhaps the metal cloth did not protect you .
No , no , it gave me complete insulation .
I must have been careless somehow .
Benet , you know more of the chemistry of the body than any man alive .
Something must be done for me so that I can go back and solve the power of this element .
There is a counteractive for radium poisoning derived from radium itself .
Have you a sample of this new element ?
Yes .
Yes .
There .
Do you think I can be helped ?
I can 't say until I deduce the atomic structure of this .
I 've done that .
You 'll find my calculations there .
All right .
I 'll begin at once to work out the counteractive .
No one must know what 's happened to me .
Is there any place where I can hide myself ?
Oh , yes .
There 's a little tent in the back where I store my instruments .
You can keep out of sight there .
I 'll show you .
Wake up , Rukh .
Wake up .
You 've been asleep for an hour .
Look at yourself .
I gave you the counteractive exactly at midnight .
My hands are not glowing .
No , your hands aren 't glowing , nor your face .
I can touch people now ?
Yes .
But remember what I 've told you .
Nothing can ever cure you .
At best , your state of poisoning can only be checked , suspended .
And now that a counteractive has gone into your bloodstream , you can only live if you use a small amount of it at regular intervals each day all the days of your life .
Here 's the formula .
And if I exceed the time , what happens ?
Your body again becomes the deadly machine it was .
Your touch will kill .
Shortly after that you will become deadly to yourself as well .
If you do not use the counteractive in time , you will literally crumble to an ash .
Remember , I told you all the conditions .
You accepted the risks .
Yes , yes .
But at least after each treatment , I should be immune .
Normal .
As I told you , I don 't know enough yet to say what effect the violent surcharge of poison and antidote will have upon the brain .
Yes .
I took that risk .
This is the counteractive .
Guard it carefully .
And what do you plan to do now ?
Go back to my camp , complete my tests , and return here as quickly as possible .
Tell no one of this .
Promise me .
I promise .
There 's no use pretending any longer .
You know that I love you .
I have known it for a long time .
That 's why I have been afraid .
Of me ?
No .
Of us .
Oh , Diana , why fight something that 's so much stronger than we are ?
We must .
Do you love him ?
My father idolized him .
When he died , I promised him that I would marry Janos .
What are we going to do ?
I don 't know .
Dinner .
We must go .
Yes .
Yes , boss .
Where 's Dr. Rukh ?
Boss tent there .
Oh , yes , I want to see him .
Dr. Benet .
How did you find this place ?
We listened to the drums .
They talked of a white man who made magic in the mountains .
How are you feeling ?
No ill effects so far ?
So far , none .
You 'd better get out of the sun .
Huh ?
Oh , yes .
Yes .
Some water ?
There .
They expected you back in camp long before this .
Yes , I know .
There was always one thing more to do .
Days passed , and before I knew it , weeks .
I have harnessed it at last , Benet .
I could crumple up a city a thousand miles away .
I could destroy a nation .
All nations .
You have harnessed its power to destroy .
Have you harnessed it to heal ?
That will come later , when I devise a filter to curb its power .
But in the meantime , it 's mine to experiment with .
Mine .
Stevens and I felt that would be your attitude .
That was why we decided your discovery was too important to be in the hands of one man .
Just what do you mean ?
Stevens is now on his way to the International Scientific Congress that opened in Paris last month .
He 's taking with him the specimen you left with me .
Why , you thieves !
Thieves !
You forget we came to Africa for a common purpose .
I discovered it .
Oh , the credit will be given you for the discovery .
Never fear .
Oh , thieves !
Thieves !
We couldn 't wait for you forever , Rukh .
Besides , your wife has been quite ill , so we decided to break up camp and go .
My wife ?
Yes .
She is on her way to Europe with the Stevens .
I join them at Lake Nyanza .
Diana gone ?
Stevens ' wife is looking after her .
She asked me to hand you this letter .
She doesn 't believe I love her .
She loves someone else .
Drake ?
Yes .
To come like thieves in the night and steal everything from me .
Get out of here , Benet !
Get out before I ...
Don 't move , Mother .
Sit quite still .
In a few moments , we will know .
Hand ...
Yes .
Yes .
Yes , I see .
I can see .
You see everything ?
More clearly than I ever saw before .
Oh .
I am frightened by what I see .
I have harnessed it .
Harnessed it .
It 's mine at last .
You have work to do that will take you all your life .
Tomorrow I leave for Paris .
No .
No .
Stay here and work .
I must go , Mother .
You will find tragedy there .
I know .
In case I do find tragedy , I leave my secret with you . It is all there .
More power than man has ever possessed .
Power to heal , power to destroy .
Guard it for me .
Don 't be afraid , my dear .
You will be all right .
I 'm not afraid .
That is fine .
Load it , please .
I 'm Dr. Janos Rukh .
Come , please .
Baby .
Baby .
Can you see me ?
Yes , Mommy .
I can see you .
My baby .
Where does one find Dr. Benet ?
I am Janos Rukh .
Janos Rukh ?
Dr. Benet is in his laboratory .
I will show you there immediately .
Now you must go , make way for the others .
Prepare the next patient .
Thank you .
My baby can see .
My baby can see .
Yes , Mommy , I can see .
Oh , baby , baby .
Rukh .
I seem to have arrived at an interesting moment .
You have arrived to see what your discovery has done for this little one .
She was blind .
It has made her see .
Thank you .
Oh , thank you .
Thank you , Doctor .
Thank you .
That 's all for now .
It seems , as usual , I am a little late .
No .
All Paris is waiting to pile honors on you .
You know , of course , the Nobel Prize was awarded to you .
Yes , yes .
I know . I know .
Everybody considers you and Sir Francés Stevens very generous men .
I wondered about your health .
The counteractive is still effective .
And Diana ?
Oh , she is well .
She has become Lady Arabella 's secretary .
She and Drake plan to marry , of course ?
They are in love , but she declares she will do nothing until she hears from you .
She will hear of me , shortly .
I will not stand in the way of their happiness .
This is very fine of you , Rukh .
Well , I must leave you to your ministrations .
You see , I was right , Rukh .
Your discovery is too great for one man to control .
Some day you will realize that you haven 't even scratched the possibilities of Radium X.
And I am still the only man to control it fully .
Yes .
You 'll do .
Same height , same width .
What do I want ?
I want to do you a benefit .
Yes .
The greatest benefit one man can do another .
Those who have never seen the moonlight over the African veldt
have missed a thrilling vision which can be witnessed in no other land .
A lion caught in the thorn bush and ...
Milady .
Briggs , you have been instructed never to interrupt me when I am at dictation .
But the paper , milady .
The papers ?
You know I never read them .
This is important .
Oh , very well .
What is it ?
" With all my worldly goods I thee endow . "
With all my worldly goods I thee endow .
Whom God hath joined together , let no man put asunder .
Goodbye , dear .
Goodbye , darling .
Ronnie , dear .
Goodbye , dear .
I 'm sure you 'll both be very , very happy .
Au revoir .
Goodbye , my boy .
Goodbye .
Six .
Six of us .
Are you the manager ?
Yes .
Have you a room vacant ?
A front room ?
A room ?
Providentially , sir , I have .
Step this way , sir .
It 's Mrs. LeGrand , sir , I 'm British to the backbone , though misfortunes and a French husband has brought me to Paris lodgings .
You 'll like the room .
It 's a lovely fireplace and it don 't smoke , and the bed is excellent .
Me poor husband , he died in it so comfortable .
I 'll take the room .
And I 'd like the Paris Herald every morning .
Yes , sir .
That will be , uh , 50 francs a week , sir .
Huh ?
Oh , oh .
Thank you , sir .
Sir Francis Stevens :
Thief .
Have you ever seen anyone so incredibly happy as Diana and Ronald when they started on their honeymoon ?
I hope they will be happy .
We should be late if Francis doesn 't hurry .
Go to Sir Francis ' room and tell him Dr. Benet and I are waiting .
Poor dear .
When he came from his lecture tonight at the University , he was so utterly exhausted that I told him to lie down .
He is feeling better since we returned from Africa ?
Oh , yes .
He has even forgotten to complain about his ankles .
What 's that ?
Celeste .
Celeste .
Speak , you fool .
What is it ?
Dr. Benet , come up , please .
At once .
Pierre .
Sir Francis .
Sir Francis .
Oh .
This is awful .
Look at his eyes .
What hideous thing did he see , do you think ?
The police must be sent for at once .
But before they come , I would like to try an experiment .
It must be done before the eye tissues glaze .
Have I your permission ?
Yes .
Is there an ultraviolet camera here ?
Yes .
I 'll get it for you .
Please .
Rukh .
I knew it .
... ln New York , in Rome ...
Come in .
Good morning , sir .
Good morning , Mrs. LeGrand .
Oh , there 's more excitement .
Yes .
What has happened across the street ?
Vandals , sir .
They come in the night and they smashed the entire one of them figures .
They didn 't leave nothing but a little pile of melted stuff .
But that 's impossible .
That 's what everybody says .
But a fact 's a fact , sir .
If you 'll excuse me , sir , I 'll just pop across and see what the latest is .
Yes , Mrs. LeGrand .
Do come back and tell me more .
Well , I 'll find out , sir .
Won 't be a second .
I 'll find out all I can .
Lady Stevens :
Matchmaker .
Radium X claims third victim .
Paris edition of the New York Herald .
Radium X claims third victim .
Radium X claims third victim .
Radium X claims third victim .
Radium X claims third victim .
No , please .
It will be better , I think , if you take Diana away .
I will answer any questions .
We 'll be downstairs if you do need us .
Now I will explain why I insisted the Medical Examiner and his assistants wear insulated gloves when they touch the body .
Will you turn out the lights ?
Look closely at the neck of the victim .
Lights , please .
You observe those finger marks cannot be seen in the light .
It is phosphorus , possibly ?
No .
Radium X.
Inflicted by the grasp of someone contaminated by the poison .
Do you know such a person ?
Only one , he is dead .
But there Is a story behind all this .
And I am going to ask you to listen to some facts .
There 's some curse .
Diana , my dear , there are no such things as curses .
Well , they needn 't look any farther for the murderer .
Here she is .
Stop it !
I won 't let you talk like that .
If I hadn 't left him , they would all be alive today .
Janos , Sir Francis and Arabella .
Stop it .
We loved each other .
We belong to each other .
You never belonged to him .
And no law of nature or man can make it anything but right to do what we did .
He shan 't reach out of his grave and spoil our lives .
I 'll fight it .
But what are you going to fight ?
Something you can 't see ?
Something you can 't reach ?
Something you can 't touch ?
Oh , darling .
Hold me tight .
We 're going to need each other so very much .
Yes , I have feared something like this ever since the day he left my laboratory .
And I always doubted his death .
So now , you know all I have to tell you .
You believe that the man who was buried as Dr. Rukh was not Dr. Rukh ?
Yes .
I believe that Rukh is alive and in Paris .
I believe that this city is at the mercy of a madman whose body is an engine of destruction .
I talked to his mother on the telephone a little while ago , and it is also her belief that Rukh is alive .
We will take immediate steps to locate him .
Gentlemen .
A figure melted while a crowd of people watched .
Only one element on Earth could have done it .
Diana and I were married at that church , and there were six of us in Africa .
Do you suppose Rukh 's crazy brain drew some analogy between that fact , and the six figures of the saints on the church ?
He killed two of us and destroyed two of the six figures .
A man and a woman in each case .
You and your wife must go into seclusion immediately .
Also you , Dr. Benet , while we comb Paris for this madman .
It might be simpler to get him to come here .
How do you propose this ?
Ask him for dinner ?
No , not quite .
But that 's the general idea .
Let the newspapers give out a story that the three remaining survivors of our African expedition are leaving Paris immediately for an unknown destination .
But before departing , there will be a meeting here .
What sort of meeting ?
Well , what do you think would draw him , Doctor ?
A lecture concerning my recent experiments with Radium X , and a chance to reach you and me .
You are both willing to take such risk ?
Of course .
Yes .
I will invite a limited number of scientists , to be admitted by card only .
Do you think it 's fair to expose them to the danger ?
There are only two people he wants to destroy .
Two , or perhaps three .
My men can check the list of invitations at the gate and maybe capture him there .
Also mingle with your guests .
Exactly .
I will set the hour of midnight for the lecture .
At that time his luminosity will be strong , as he will delay taking the counteractive , hoping for a chance to use his deadliness upon Drake and me .
If your men fail to capture him at the gate , then at midnight we bolt all doors and darken the entire house .
His face and hands will appear like ...
like phosphorus regardless of any disguise .
And if he touches anyone ?
They die .
Prof. Lemaire .
Prof. Lemaire .
Prof. Gothe .
Prof. Gothe .
Dr. Benet .
Prof. Reinhardt .
A very strange hour for such a meeting , don 't you think ?
Perhaps .
But Radium X is a very strange subject .
Benet has his reasons .
Undoubtedly .
He must have something of importance to show us .
Even the president of our Congress is here .
Professor Michaeljohn , if I am not mistaken ?
Yes , I am Michaeljohn .
Who are you , sir ?
Jones , of the University of Wales .
We met once , but perhaps you don 't recall me .
I ... I think I do .
One meets so many people .
I shall never forget your treatise on radiation , sir .
Oh , you ...
you remember that , huh ?
No doubt , you are on your way to Dr. Benet 's demonstration .
Yes .
It should be a most interesting evening .
It should indeed .
I understand that no one is to be admitted without a card .
Yes .
Oh , that reminds me .
Yes , yes , I 've got it .
Forgetful sometimes .
Well , under the circumstances ...
Of course .
A nasty night .
Most disagreeable indeed .
I think I 've caught a chill .
Napoleon brandy , sir .
I believe a sip or two would help us on our way .
I suggest that we step in here , out of the rain .
I am not very much on spirits , but considering the night , why ...
Dr. Reno .
Dr. Reno .
Dr. Fergie .
Dr. Fergie .
Prof. Michaeljohn .
Prof. Michaeljohn .
All are here , except one name .
To be admitted instantly .
Beaudine , you will stand at the main house switch .
It is to be thrown at exactly 12 : 00 .
No stranger has tried to come in , and all invitations are accounted for .
Perhaps he won 't come .
He will be here .
Probably he 's here now .
Monsieur le Président .
Oh , Dr. Benet .
If you will be patient for just a few minutes longer , I will make final adjustments in my laboratory and be ready .
We expected you .
I knew that .
Five thieves .
Two are gone , three are left .
Do you intend to kill us all ?
Yes .
I felt it was better to let things alone when you were first poisoned .
I warned you about your brain .
It began to affect my brain almost immediately .
I could feel it coming , crawling for cells .
Aren 't there ever moments when you think as you used to think , when you were human ?
Not often now , not often .
And because of that we must die .
No , because you are thieves .
Five thieves .
All thieves .
It will be easiest just to shake hands .
It will all be over in a second .
My wife ?
In her room with Mrs. Noyer , as you desired .
But she is nervous , sir .
So am I.
Still , it will soon be over , one way or the other .
Yes , sir .
One way or the other .
I know something awful has happened .
Try to compose yourself , Madame .
I can 't stand this any longer .
Find Mr. Drake and tell him I must see him , if only for a moment .
I was ordered to remain here .
Oh , please go .
Oh , as you say , Madame .
Madame Rukh .
It 's good of you to come .
It 's my duty to be here .
Where is Diana ?
Oh , she is upstairs in her room .
Ronnie .
Ronnie .
Diana .
Janos .
Strange Dr. Benet doesn 't return , don 't you think ?
Yes , very strange .
Dr. Benet ?
Dr. Benet !
He isn 't here .
Yes , he is .
And so is Rukh .
Don 't go any closer .
Max , Louie , the front stairs .
No , I can 't kill you .
I can 't .
But he must die .
No , Janos !
Mother .
No .
I must have time .
I must go on to reach one more .
Drake .
Don 't fire .
My son .
You have broken the first law of science .
Yes , you are right .
It 's better this way .
Goodbye , Mother .
Diana !
Diana .
My darling .
You 're safe .
Madame Rukh , permit me to pay you my homage .
Janos Rukh is dead , but part of him will go on eternally working for humanity .
Corny , who do you think you 're talking to ?
If the Semple attorneys don 't know who the heir is , who does ?
Come on , Corny .
I 've done you a lot of favors .
Who 's getting the Semple dough ?
You 're asking the wrong guy , Mac .
I 'm only a press agent .
- Newspaperman ?
- Wants to know who the heir is .
- Hang up .
- Sorry , Mac , I can 't ...
- Yeah , sure , but I ain 't the attorney .
- Hang up !
Mr. Cedar is , and I haven 't seen him in two days .
- Cedar , we gotta deal with the papers .
- I 'm not interested in the newspapers .
But it 's a great story .
Somewhere a guy is walking into 20 million bucks .
My first concern is to locate the lucky man .
When I do , you keep the newspapers away from him .
Okay , as long as that weekly stipend keeps coming in .
We located him , Mr. Cedar .
- Yes , John , we got him .
- Here 's the report .
Longfellow Deeds , single , 28, lives in Mandrake Falls , Vermont .
- Thank heaven .
- Better wire him .
I 'll do no such thing .
I 'm going there myself . You too , Anderson .
You too , Cobb .
Make three train reservations to Mandrake Falls , Vermont .
- Where ?
- Mandrake Falls .
" Welcome to Mandrake Falls ... where the scenery enthrals ... where no hardship e 'er befalls .
Welcome to Mandrake Falls " . That 's pretty .
- You 're sure he lives in this town ?
- This is the town , all right .
Well , I hope it 's not a wild goose chase .
No , sir , we checked it thoroughly . He lives here , all right .
I spy a native .
Let 's ask him .
- Good morning .
- Morning , neighbors , morning .
That 's an excellent start .
At least we 've broken the ice .
Do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds ?
Deeds ?
Yes , sir . Yes , indeedy .
Everyone knows Deeds .
Must be a game he 's playing .
We 'd like to get in touch with him .
- Who 's that ?
- Deeds . Who do you think ?
Oh , yes , Deeds .
Fine fellow .
Very democratic .
You won 't have no trouble at all . Talks to anybody .
- We 'd better try somebody else .
- No . Next time he comes out , I 'll straddle him while you ask him your questions .
Morning , neighbors .
Remember us , the fellows who were here a minute ago ?
Oh , yes , indeedy .
I never forget a face .
Listen , pop .
We 've come all the way from New York to look up a fellow named Deeds .
It 's important .
It 's very important .
Don 't get rough , neighbor .
Just ask .
Then please pretend , for just one fleeting moment , that I 'm asking .
- Where does he reside ?
Longfellow Deeds .
Where does he live ?
Oh , that 's what you want .
Why didn 't you say so in the first place ?
Those fellows don 't know what they 're talking about .
I 'll take you there .
If they 'd only explained to me what they want , there 'd be no trouble .
Oh . Will you come in , please , gentlemen ?
- Is Mr. Deeds in ?
- No .
He 's over to the park arranging a bazaar to raise money for the fire engine .
Mal , you should 've knowed he was in the park .
Knowed it all the time , but they wanted to see the house .
Can 't read their minds if they don 't say what they want .
Come in , please .
- Can I get you a cup of tea ?
- No , thank you .
Sit down .
Sure I couldn 't get you a glass of lemonade or something ? No .
That 's very kind of you .
- Are you related to him ?
- No , I 'm his housekeeper .
We 'd like to find out something about him . What does he do for a living ?
He and Jim Mason own the tailor works , but that 's not how he makes his money .
- He makes most of it from his poetry .
- He writes poetry ?
Oh , my goodness , yes .
Longfellow 's famous .
He writes all those things on postcards .
You know , for Christmas and Easter and birthdays .
Sit down , please .
Here 's one .
He got 25 dollars for this one .
" When you 've nowhere to turn and you 're filled with doubt ... don 't stand in midstream hesitating ... for you know that your mother 's heart cries out ...
'I 'm waiting , my boy , I 'm waiting ' . "
Isn 't that beautiful ?
Isn 't it a lovely sentiment ?
Yeah .
Here he is now .
I suggest you break it to him gently .
He 's liable to keel over from the shock .
They 've been waiting a long while .
- Who are they ?
- I don 't know .
- Mr. Longfellow Deeds ?
- Yes .
How do you do ?
I 'm John Cedar , of the New York firm of Cedar , Cedar , Cedar and Budington .
Budington must feel like an awful stranger .
- Mr. Cornelius Cobb .
Mr. Anderson .
- How do you do ?
You gentlemen make yourselves comfortable .
Thank you .
Thanks .
New mouthpiece .
Been waitin ' two weeks for this .
Kids keep swiping them all the time .
They use ' em for bean shooters .
- What can I do for you gentlemen ?
- You gentlemen going to stay to lunch ?
- I 'd like to ask you a few questions .
- All right .
- Are you Joseph and Mary Deeds ' son ?
- Your parents living ?
- Why , no .
Well , Mr. Deeds , does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you ?
Not much .
He 's an uncle of mine , I think .
I never saw him .
My mother 's name was Semple .
Well , he passed on .
He was killed in a motor accident in Italy .
He was ?
Gee , that 's too bad .
- If there 's anything I can do ...
- I have good news for you , sir .
Mr. Semple left a large fortune when he died .
He left it all to you .
Deducting the taxes ... it amounts to something in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars .
How about lunch ?
Are the gentlemen staying ?
Of course .
She 's got some fresh orange layer cake with that thick stuff on the top .
Sure .
They don 't want to go to the hotel .
Perhaps you didn 't hear what I said , Mr. Deeds .
The whole Semple fortune goes to you ...
20 million dollars .
Oh , yes , I heard you , all right .
Twenty million is quite a lot , isn 't it ?
- It 'll do in a pinch .
- Yes , indeed .
I wonder why he left me all that money .
I don 't need it .
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman .
Associated with your uncle for many years , as a sort of buffer .
Buffer ?
Yeah .
A glorified doormat .
Rich people need someone to keep the crowds away . The world 's full of pests .
Then there 's the newspapers .
One must know when to seek publicity and when to avoid it .
Cedar , Cedar , Cedar and Budington .
I can 't think of a rhyme for " Budington " .
Why should you ?
Whenever I run across a funny name , I like to poke around for a rhyme .
- Don 't you ?
- I 've got one for Cobb .
- Yeah ?
There once was a man named Cobb who kept Semple away from the mob .
Came the turn of the tide and Semple , he died .
Now poor Cobb 's out of a job .
- Sounds like two weeks ' notice to me .
- Huh ?
I 've gotten the sackeroo in many ways , but never in rhyme .
I don 't mean that .
I 'll need your help .
That 's different , if it 's just poetry .
Are you married ?
Who , me ?
No . He 's too fussy for that .
That 's what 's the matter with him .
There 's lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls ...
Don 't pay any attention to her .
He 's got a lot of foolish notions about saving a lady in distress .
Now , you keep out of this .
Saving a lady in distress , eh ?
We all have dreams like that when we 're young .
Incidentally , we 'd better get started .
You 'll have to pack .
- What for ?
- You 're going to New York with us .
- When ?
- This afternoon , 4 : 00 .
I don 't think we 've got any suitcases .
Well , we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson .
She went to Niagara Falls last year .
I 'm kinda nervous .
I 've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life .
- Like to see Grant 's tomb , though .
- I can understand that .
We 'll meet you at the train at 4 : 00 .
Congratulations , Mr. Deeds .
You 're one of the richest men in the country . See you later .
Good-bye . Thank you .
- See you later , kid .
- Good day , sir .
Did you hear what he said ?
Do you know how much 20 million is ?
I don 't care .
You sit there and eat your lunch .
You haven 't touched a thing .
For he 's a jolly good fellow For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
I can 't find him .
I looked everywhere .
His house is locked up .
- Probably had a change of heart .
- He wasn 't anxious to come .
Here comes the train .
- Look .
- What ?
That tuba player .
Well ... now I 've seen everything .
Good-bye , Mrs. Meredith !
Good-bye , Jim !
Bye , Buddy !
Gosh , I got a lot of friends .
- Have a drink ?
- No , thanks .
Cigar ?
No , thank you .
I wouldn 't worry if I were you .
A large portion like this entails great responsibility , but you 'll have help . So don 't worry .
Leave everything to me .
- I wasn 't worried about that . - No ?
I was wondering where they 're gonna get another tuba player for the band .
- Hello , John .
Where you been ?
- I 've been fishing .
Good morning , Mr. Cedar .
Good morning .
Where are they ?
- Waiting for you .
- Good morning , Mr. Cedar .
Good morning .
- Hello , boys . - Well , what 's he like ?
We 've nothing to worry about .
He 's as naive as a child . Close that door .
- Get Mrs. Cedar on the phone .
- John , what happened ?
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip .
- John , did you get ...
- No , Budington . I didn 't get the power of attorney , but I will .
I asked him what he was going to do with the money .
What do you suppose he said ?
Give it away . - The boy must be a nitwit .
- John , you had the right hunch .
- John , we can 't afford ...
- I know , Budington .
We can 't afford to have the books investigated right now .
You 've said that a thousand times .
What if they fall into somebody else 's hands ?
It hasn 't happened yet .
But half-a-million dollars , my goodness ...
Will you stop worrying !
I got Semple to turn it all over to us .
And who got power of attorney from him ?
All right , then I 'll get it again .
Now , take it easy .
Those books will never leave this office . Yokel .
Nothing but a yokel .
Your uncle must 've been mad to leave all that money to him .
You 're as closely related to him as he is , and what did you get ?
- I say , what did you get ?
- Stop yelling .
- Can I help it if Uncle didn 't like me ?
- I told you to be nice to him .
Ten years we 've waited for that old man to kick off .
Then we were gonna be on Easy Street .
Yeah , on Easy Street .
- It 's too late now .
You 're a nuisance .
- That 's just what I 'm gonna be .
I 'm gonna be a nuisance until I get ahold of some of that money .
He 's news !
Every time he blows his nose , it 's news .
A corn-fed bohunk like that falling into the Semple fortune is hot copy .
It 's gotta be personal . It 's gotta have an angle .
What does he think about ?
How does it feel to be a millionaire ?
What does he think of New York ? Is he smart ? Dumb ?
A million angles .
He 's been here three days , and what have you numbskulls brought in ?
- A half-wit novice could 've done better .
- We tried ...
Am I talking too loud or annoying anybody ?
You know Corny Cobb .
He 's keeping him under lock and key .
Never mind .
Use what little brains you 've got .
Find out something for yourselves , you imbecilic stupes .
Now get out of here before I really tell you what I think of you .
- What was that ?
- I said you had dirty plaster .
You too .
Thought I could depend on you , but you 're as bad as the rest . Look .
I can do it .
What 's gotten into you , Babe ?
Normally you 'd blast this town wide open before letting Cobb get away with this .
He 's not getting away with anything .
Babe , get me some stuff on this guy and you can have ...
- Can I have a month 's vacation ? - With pay .
With pay ?
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow .
I 'll keep the whole front page open .
What are you gonna do ? Have lunch .
The first time I ever had a suit made on purpose .
It 's merely a suggestion , Mr. Deeds ... but if you 'll give me power of attorney , we 'll take care of everything . It 'll save you a lot of annoyances .
Everyone will try to sell you something .
There have been a lot of them already .
Strangest kind of people .
Salesmen , politicians , moochers . All want something .
Haven 't had a minute to myself . Haven 't seen Grant 's tomb yet .
Your uncle didn 't bother with that sort of thing . He left everything to us .
He traveled , enjoyed himself .
You should do the same thing .
Besides wanting to be my lawyer ... you want to handle my investments too ?
- Yes .
That is to say ...
- How much extra would it cost ?
- No extra charge .
- That 's a lot of extra work .
But that 's a service Cedar , Cedar , Cedar and Budington usually donates .
Budington .
I can 't think of a rhyme for Budington yet .
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room , sir .
They 're getting a trifle impatient .
I forgot about them .
What do you think they want ?
Your uncle was chairman of the board .
They probably expect you to carry on .
I 'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on and that you 'll be right down .
Oh , did you send that telegram to Jim Mason yet ?
Jim Mason ?
Oh , yeah , yeah .
No , I didn 't send it .
I 've got it written out , though .
Here it is .
" Arthur 's been with the tailor works too long . Stop .
Don 't think we should fire him .
Longfellow " .
Send it right away .
I don 't want him to fire Arthur .
Sure , we don 't want to fire Arthur .
He was the last baby my father delivered , Arthur was .
You ought to give this matter some thought .
I mean about the power of attorney .
Oh , yes , I will .
I 'll give it a lot of thought .
There was a fellow named Winslow here a while ago ... wanted to handle my business for nothing too .
Puzzles me why these people want to work for nothing .
It isn 't natural .
I guess I 'd better think about it some more .
That 's that .
You go to an awful lot of work to keep a fella warm .
Yes , sir .
A Mr. Hallor to see you , sir .
Hallor ?
Don 't let him in .
Why not ?
Who 's he ?
A lawyer representing a woman .
Some claim against the estate .
If he has a claim , we 'd better see him .
Send him in .
He 'll cause you a lot of trouble .
How can he make trouble for me ?
I haven 't done anything .
- I told you to take this up with me .
- I 'm tired of being pushed around .
I don 't care how important you are .
- Mr. Deeds , I represent Mrs. Semple .
- Mrs. Semple ?
Your uncle 's common-law wife . She has a legal claim on the estate .
- Suppose we let the courts decide ...
- You wouldn 't dare take this to court .
I 'll leave it to you .
Would any court not be in sympathy with a woman who gave up her best years ... for an old man like your uncle ?
- What kind of wife did you say ?
- Common-law wife .
- On top of that , there 's a child .
- Child ? My uncle ?
- Yes , sir .
- That 's awful .
The poor woman should be taken care of immediately .
I 'm glad to see you 're willing to be reasonable .
If she was his wife , she should have the money .
I don 't want a penny .
Don 't make any rash promises . Better go .
That opera mob is about to break into the mad song from Lucia . I don 't wanna keep them waiting .
They 're important people .
- Very good , sir .
- I can 't go down like this .
I wish you 'd go along with me , Cobb .
They 're all strangers to me .
- What about it , Mr. Deeds ?
- Huh ?
Oh . You 'll excuse me , won 't you ?
I 'll be right back .
Gee , I 'm busy . Do the opera people always come here for their meetings ?
- Uh-huh .
- That 's funny . Why 's that ?
Why do mice go where there 's cheese ?
I 'm led to believe the young man 's quite childish .
We won 't have any difficulty getting him to put up the entire amount .
- After all , it 's only $ 180,000 .
- Excellent idea .
We 're very fortunate the young man is so sympathetic toward music .
He plays the tuba in the town band .
- Here he comes .
- Good .
The first order of business will be electing a new chairman of the board .
As a sentimental gesture toward the best friend that opera ever had ... the late Mr. Semple ... I think it only fitting that his nephew , Mr. Longfellow Deeds ... should be made our next chairman .
- I therefore nominate him .
- Seconded .
- All those in favor ?
- Aye !
Carried .
Our congratulations , Mr. Deeds .
- I 'm chairman ?
- Yes . You 've just been elected .
- I 'm chairman !
- Happy voyage .
Right here , Mr. Deeds .
Now , the next order of business ...
the reading of the secretary 's minutes .
- Move we dispense with it .
- Seconded .
- All in favor ?
- Aye !
I think they can be dispensed with .
- We 're ready for the treasurer 's report .
- Move we dispense with it .
- Seconded .
- All in favor .
Quite right .
Now , gentlemen , the next order of business ...
Just a minute .
What does the chairman do ?
Well , the chairman presides the meeting .
That 's what I thought .
But , if you don 't mind , I 'm rather interested in the treasurer 's report .
The treasurer reports a deficit of $ 180,000 for the current year . A deficit ?
You mean we lost that much ?
You see , Mr. Deeds , the opera is not conducted for profit .
It isn 't ?
What is it conducted for ?
It 's an artistic institution .
- We own an opera house , don 't we ?
- We do .
- And we give shows ?
- We provide opera .
But you charge ...
I mean , you sell tickets ?
- Of course .
- And it doesn 't pay ? Impossible .
The opera has never paid .
Well , then , we must give the wrong kind of shows .
There isn 't any wrong or right kind .
Opera is opera .
I guess , but I wouldn 't care to be head of a business that kept losing money .
That wouldn 't be common sense .
Incidentally , where is the $ 180,000 coming from ?
Well , we were rather expecting it to come from you . - Me ?
- Naturally .
Excuse me , gentlemen .
There 's nothing natural about that .
Fire engine !
Gee , that was a pip !
We 're gonna have one like that in Mandrake Falls soon , with a siren too .
Uh , where were we ?
You see , the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business .
- Why not ?
- Because it just isn 't a business .
Maybe it isn 't to you , but it certainly is to me ... if I have to make up a loss of $ 180,000 .
If it 's losing that much money , there must be something wrong .
Maybe you charge too much . Maybe you 're selling bad merchandise .
A lot of things . I don 't know .
You see , I expect to do a lot of good with that money ... and I can 't afford to put it into anything that I don 't look into .
That 's my decision for the time being , gentlemen .
Good-bye , and thank you for making me chairman .
Gentlemen , you 'll find the smelling salts in the medicine chest .
Sorry to keep you waiting .
Those opera people are funny .
They wanted me to put up $ 180,000 .
- What about it , Mr. Deeds ?
- I turned them down , naturally .
- No , I mean about my client .
- Oh .
We 'll have to do something about the common wife .
- Tails tonight , sir ?
- Tails ?
Why , that 's a monkey suit .
You want people to laugh at me ?
I 've never worn one of those in my life .
Good-bye , and thank you , sir .
Good-bye .
Wants me to wear a monkey suit .
- We don 't want to appear greedy .
- I say , we don 't want to appear greedy .
- Oh , that .
- What are you doing ?
- Assisting you , sir .
I don 't want anybody holding the ends of my pants . Get up from there .
Imagine that .
Holding the ends of my pants .
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate .
- Don 't ever get on your knees again .
- No , sir . What 'd you say ?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one-third of the estate .
One-third .
That 's about seven million dollars .
Well , we didn 't expect that much .
I 'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million .
Take up any settlement talk with me in the office .
I 'll do no such thing .
That 's right . There 's only one place you 're going , and that 's out the door .
- You 're making a mistake .
- Oh , no , I 'm not .
I don 't like your face .
Besides , there 's something fishy about a person who 'd settle for a million ... when they can get seven million .
I 'm surprised that Mr. Cedar , who 's supposed to be a smart man ... couldn 't see through that .
Now , wait a minute , buddy ...
One nice thing about being rich ... you ring a bell and things happen .
When the servant comes in , Mr. Hallor , I 'll ask him to show you to the door . Many people don 't know where it is .
No use in getting tough .
That 'll get you nowhere .
We 've got letters .
- Show Mr. Hallor to the front door .
- Yes , sir .
There isn 't any wife , there aren 't any letters , and I think you 're a crook ... so you 'd better watch your step .
I can 't hold out any longer .
Lamb bites wolf . Beautiful .
It 's only common sense .
I can 't hold out any longer either , Mr. Deeds .
Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair .
You 're not my attorney yet , not until I find out what 's on your mind .
Suppose you get the books straightened out so I can have a look at ' em .
Yes , of course , if you wish .
But you must be prepared . This sort of thing will be daily routine .
If it becomes annoying , you let me know .
Good-bye , Mr. Deeds .
Good-bye , sir .
Even his hands are oily .
Well , how about tonight ? What would you like in the way of entertainment ?
Entertainment ?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones .
Tall and stately .
How would you like yours ?
Dark or fair ?
Tall or short ?
Fat or thin ?
Tough or tender ?
- What are you talking about ?
- Women . Ever heard of ' em ?
Oh !
- Name your poison , and I 'll supply it .
- Some other time , Cobb .
Okay .
You 're the boss .
When your blood begins to boil , yell out . I 'll be seeing you .
He talks about women as if they were cattle .
Every man to his taste , sir .
Tell me , Walter , are all these stories I hear about my uncle true ?
Well , sir , he sometimes had as many as 20 in the house at the same time .
- Twenty ?
What 'd he do with ' em ?
- That is something I never found out .
Hey !
You going out ?
- Yes . Isn 't that all right ?
- No . - You never go out without telling us .
- Who are you ?
We 're your bodyguards .
- Oh , yeah ?
- Yeah .
Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail .
That 's very nice of Mr. Cobb , but I don 't want anybody sticking to my tail .
Sorry , mister .
Orders is orders .
We gotta get you up in the morning , put you to bed at night .
Only it 's all right . No matter what we see , we don 't see nothin ' , see ?
- That 's gonna be fun .
- Some people like it .
- Will you do something for me first ?
- Sure .
Put that away , slug .
At your service .
- Would you get my trunk out for me ?
- Certainly .
With pleasure .
We 're your bodyguards !
You can 't do this !
There he is .
- That 's him .
- That 's who ?
- Get your cameras ready and follow me .
- What are you gonna do ?
Never mind .
Follow me and grab whatever you can get .
It 's gonna be the same old thing .
- That dame is nuts . - Right .
You fainted .
Oh , did I ?
I 'm sorry .
- Can I help you ?
- No , thank you .
I 'll be all right .
This is my house .
- I 'd like to ...
- Oh , no , really , I 'll be all right .
What happened ?
Well , I ... I guess I walked too much .
I 've been looking for a job all day .
I found one too .
I start tomorrow .
You 've been awfully kind .
Thank you very much .
Hey !
Taxi !
Hey , Stu , follow that cab they just got into , will ya !
- Hurry up !
Step on it !
- Come on , let 's go !
Feel better now ?
This tastes so good .
Mr. Deeds , I don 't know how I can ever thank you .
Tell me more about yourself .
Well , I guess I 've told you almost everything there is to tell .
My folks live in a small town near Hartford .
I 'm down here alone trying to make a living .
I 'm really just a nobody .
Oh , that was so lovely .
Thank you .
You were a lady in distress , weren 't you ?
What ?
Nothing .
Waiter .
- Has anybody come in yet ?
- Uh , no . Nobody important .
Be sure and point them out to me .
I 'm a writer myself , you know .
I write poetry .
Well ... you 've been having quite an exciting time , haven 't you ?
With all these meetings , business deals , society people ... haven 't you been having fun ?
No .
That is , I didn 't until I met you .
I like talking to you though .
Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep .
- Brookfield 's just come in . - Who ?
The poet ?
Where ?
Over at that big round table .
The one that looks like a poodle .
Look , there 's Brookfield , the poet .
Really ?
Pardon .
Longfellow Deeds , who just inherited the Semple fortune , wants to meet you .
Oh , yes .
I read about him .
He writes poetry on postcards .
Let 's invite him over .
Might get a couple of laughs .
Getting rather dull around here .
It 's always dull here .
- I 'll get him . - Good .
Mr. Henneberry .
Mr. Morrow .
Bill .
This is Mr. Deeds and his fiancee from Mandrake Falls .
How do you do , Mr. Deeds ?
Nice of you to ask us to come and sit with you .
Back home we never get a chance to meet famous people .
- Waiter , a little service here .
- Yes , a drink for Mr. Deeds .
- I don 't want it , thank you . - You must .
All poets drink .
Tell me , Mr. Deeds , how do you go about writing your poems ?
We craftsmen are very interested in one another 's methods .
Do you have to wait for an inspiration , or do you just dash it off ?
- Well , I ...
- Morrow just dashes them off .
Yeah .
That 's what my publishers have been complaining about .
Well , your readers don 't complain , Mr. Morrow . Oh .
Thanks .
How about you , Mr. Deeds ?
Well , I write mine on order .
The people I work for tell me what they want , and then I write it .
Amazing !
Why , that 's true genius .
Have you any peculiar characteristics when you 're creating ?
Well , I ... I play the tuba .
How original .
Well , I 've been playing the harmonica for 40 years .
Didn 't do me a bit of good .
You wouldn 't have one in your pocket , would you ?
What , a tuba ?
No , a postcard with one of your poems on it .
- Oh , no .
- You don 't carry a pocketful with you ?
Oh , too bad .
I was hoping you 'd autograph one for me .
- I was too .
- Now wait a minute , boys .
Perhaps Mr. Deeds would recite one for us .
That 's a very good idea .
Nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff .
How about a Mother 's Day poem ?
Exactly .
Give us one that rings the great American heart .
Yes .
Go ahead .
I get the idea .
I know why I was invited here ... to make fun of me .
- Oh , not at all .
- Don 't be ridiculous .
Look , he 's temperamental . Yeah ?
What if I am ? What about it ?
It 's easy to make fun of somebody if you don 't care how much you hurt ' em .
I think your poems are swell , Mr. Brookfield ... but I 'm disappointed in you .
I must look funny to you ... but maybe if you went to Mandrake Falls you 'd look just as funny to us ... only nobody would laugh at you and make you feel ridiculous ... because that wouldn 't be good manners .
Maybe writing postcard poems is comical , but a lot of people think they 're good .
Anyway , it 's the best I can do .
So if you 'll excuse me , we 'll be leaving .
I guess I found out that all famous people aren 't big people .
Just one thing more . If it weren 't for Miss Dawson being here , I 'd bump your heads together .
Oh , I don 't mind .
Then I guess maybe I will .
Waiter !
Eureka !
Stop it .
Go away , go away .
Step aside .
Say , fella , you neglected me and I feel very put out .
Look , sock it right there , will ya ?
Sock it hard .
- I 've got it off my chest .
- Oh , listen .
The difference between them and me is , I know when I 've been a skunk .
You take me to the nearest newsstand and I 'll eat a pack of your postcards raw . Raw !
Oh , what a magnificent deflation of smugness !
Pal , you 've added ten years to my life .
A poet with a straight left and a right hook ?
Delicious . Delicious .
You 're my guest from now on , forever and a day , even unto eternity .
- Thanks , but we 're going sightseeing .
- Fine . Fine . Swell .
You 've just shown me a sight lovely to behold , and I 'd like to reciprocate .
Listen , you hop aboard my magic carpet ...
Thanks ... and I 'll show you sights that you 've never seen before .
I 'd like to see Grant 's tomb and the Statue of Liberty .
You 'll not only see those , but before the evening 's half through ... you 'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa ... you 'll mount Mount Everest .
I 'll show you the pyramids and all the little pyramidees ... leaping from sphinx to sphinx .
Pal , how would you like to go on a real old-fashioned binge ?
- Binge ?
- Yeah , I mean the regain McCoy .
You play saloon with me ... and I 'll introduce you to every wit , nitwit and half-wit in New York .
We 'll go on a twister that 'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia ... look like an anemic on a goat 's milk diet .
- That oughta be fun , huh ?
- Fun ?
Say ...
Listen , I 'll take you on a bender ... that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and a joy forever .
Boy ?
Boy , my headpiece !
O Tempora !
O Mores !
O Bacchus !
- Oh , you 're drunk . - Oh , you 're right !
- If we go with him , we 'll see things .
- I guess we will .
" ' I play the tuba to help me think . '
This is one of the many startling statements made by Longfellow Deeds ... New York 's new Cinderella Man ... who went out last night to prove that his uncle , the late M.W. Semple ... from whom he inherited 20 million dollars ... was an amateur in the art of standing the town on its cauliflower ear " .
" Cinderella Man " .
That 's sensational , Babe , sensational .
Took some high-powered acting , believe me .
- Did it ?
- I was the world 's sweetest ingenue .
Is he really that big a sap ?
He 's the original .
There are no carbon copies of that one .
" Cinderella Man " . That 'll stick to him for the rest of his life .
Can you imagine Cobb 's face when he reads this ?
If we could sell tickets , we 'd make a fortune .
- How 'd you get the picture ?
- Had the boys follow us .
Marvelous . Mr. Deeds tied up traffic ... while he fed a bagful of donuts to a horse . " At 2 : 00 a. m .
When asked why he was doing it he replied ...
'To see how many donuts the horse would eat before he asked for some coffee ' " .
Beautiful !
What happened after that ?
I don 't know . I had to write the story .
He was so drunk he never even missed me .
When are you gonna see him again ?
Tonight , maybe .
I 'll phone him at noon ...
my lunch hour .
I 'm a stenographer , you know . Mary Dawson .
You 're a genius , Babe , a genius .
I even moved into MabeI Dawson 's apartment ... in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around . Good .
Stay there .
Don 't show your face down here .
I 'll say you 're on vacation .
No one will know where the stories are coming from . Stick close to him .
You can get an exclusive out of him every day .
We 'll have the other papers crazy .
- Babe , I could kiss ya ! - Oh , no .
No .
- Our deal was for a month 's vacation .
- Sure .
- With pay .
- You 'll get it , Babe .
Mr. Deeds , sir .
You really must get up .
It 's late .
- You 're Walter , aren 't you ?
- Yes , sir .
Just wanted to make sure .
If you 'll permit me to say so , sir , you were out on quite a bender last night .
Bender ?
You 're wrong , Walter .
We started out to a binge , but we never got to it .
Yes , sir .
- What 's that ?
- A prairie oyster , sir .
Prairie oyster ?
Yes , sir .
It makes the head feel smaller .
Oh .
- Has Miss Dawson called yet ?
- No Miss Dawson has called , sir .
She was the lady in distress .
She wouldn 't let me help her .
Had a lot of pride . I like that .
Oh , I do too , sir .
I 'd better call her up and apologize .
I don 't remember taking her home .
I 'd venture to say you don 't remember much of what happened last night , sir .
What do you mean ?
I remember everything .
Hand me my pants .
I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper .
You have no pants , sir .
You came home last night without them .
- I did what ?
- You came home without any clothes .
You were in your shorts .
Yes , sir .
I couldn 't walk around on the streets without any clothes .
I 'd be arrested .
That 's what the two policemen said , sir .
- What two policemen ?
- The ones who brought you home , sir .
They said you and another gentleman kept going up and down the street shouting ...
" Back to nature !
Clothes are a blight on civilization ! Back to nature ! "
Listen , Walter , if a man named Morrow calls up , tell him I 'm not in .
He may be a great author , but ...
I think he 's crazy , Walter .
Yes , sir .
Oh , by the way , did you ...
- The knee .
- But how will I put on the slipper , sir ?
Yes , sir .
I beg pardon , sir , but did you ever find what you were looking for , sir ?
Looking for ?
You kept searching me last night , sir , going through all my pockets .
You said you were looking for a rhyme for " Budington " .
- Better bring me some coffee , Walter .
- Very good , sir .
Oh , I beg pardon .
A telegram came for you , sir .
I 'll get you some black coffee , sir .
Did you see all this stuff in the paper ?
- Arthur wants to quit .
- Arthur ?
Who 's Arthur ?
He 's the shipping clerk at the tailor works .
Wants a two-dollar raise , or he 'll quit .
What do I care about Arthur ?
Did you see this stuff in the paper ?
How did it get in there ?
What did you do last night ? Who were you talking to ?
And what did you do to those bodyguards ?
They quit this morning . Said you locked them up .
They insisted on following me .
- What do you think bodyguards are for ?
- What do they mean by this ? - " Cinderella Man " .
- Are those stories true ?
" Cinderella Man " ?
They 'd call you anything if you gave ' em a chance .
They got you down as a sap .
- I 'll punch this editor in the nose .
- No , you don 't !
Get this clear .
Socking people in the nose is no solution for anything .
- Sometimes it 's the only solution .
- Not editors .
Take my word for it .
- If they 're gonna poke fun at me , I 'm ...
- Listen , Longfellow .
You got brains , kid .
You 'll get along swell if you 'll only curb your homicidal instincts . And keep your trap shut .
These newshounds are gunning for you .
- What about this " Cinderella Man " ? - I 'll take care of that .
I 'll keep that stuff out of the papers , if you 'll help me .
But I can 't do anything if you go around talking to people .
Will you promise me to be careful from now on ?
Yes , I guess I 'll have to .
Thank you .
If you feel the building rock , it 'll be me , blasting into this editor .
Cobb 's right .
I mustn 't talk to anybody .
- Miss Dawson on the phone , sir .
- Who ?
Miss Dawson ?
- Yes , sir . - Fine .
I 'll talk to her .
Give me the phone , quick .
She 's the only one I 'm gonna talk to .
- Awfully nice of you to show me around .
- I enjoy it .
The aquarium was swell .
If I lived in New York , I 'd go every day .
I bet you do .
I 'd like to , but I have a job to think of .
You 'd better keep following that bus !
Keep your shirt on !
- Looks like no pictures tonight .
- Maybe I oughta get him drunk again .
Got any news ?
I mean , has anything exciting been happening lately ?
Sure .
I met you .
What 's happening about the opera ?
Oh , that .
We had another meeting .
I told ' em I 'd go on being chairman if ...
- I 'm chairman , you know .
- Yeah , I know .
I told ' em I 'd play along if they lowered prices ... cut down expenses and broadcast . Oh .
What 'd they say ?
Gee , you look pretty tonight .
- What 'd they say ?
- Huh ? Oh .
They said I was crazy .
They said I wanted to run it like a grocery store .
What are they going to do ?
Do you always wear your hair like that ?
Isn 't it a scream ?
" Cinderella Man " . The dope .
Like to get my hooks into that guy . Don 't worry .
Someone 's probably taking him for plenty .
If they were men I 'd knock their heads together .
- Have you seen the papers ?
- Uh-huh .
That 's what I like about you .
You think about a man 's feelings .
I 'd like to punch the fella in the nose that 's writing that stuff .
" Cinderella Man " .
Pretty soon everybody 'll be calling me Cinderella Man .
Would you like to walk the rest of the way ?
It 's so nice out .
- Yes .
- Yeah , let 's .
Hey , wise guys , he 's getting off .
Come on , pull up to the curb !
Oh , come on .
Don 't you want to see it ?
Well , feast your eyes .
Grant 's tomb .
Is that it ?
Hey , beetle puss . The tomb .
Well , there you are .
Grant 's tomb .
I hope you 're not disappointed .
- It 's wonderful .
- To most people it 's an awful letdown .
Huh ?
I say , to most people it 's a washout .
That depends on what they see .
- And what do you see ? - Me ?
Oh , I see a small Ohio farm boy ... becoming a great soldier .
I see thousands of marching men .
I see General Lee , with a broken heart , surrendering .
I can see the beginning of a new nation , like Abraham Lincoln said .
And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as president .
Things like that can only happen in a country like America .
Excuse me .
Sorry , Mr. Hopper .
Mr. Cedar won 't answer his phone .
- What 's going on in the boss 's office ?
- Search me . The three C 's and little " B " have been in there over an hour .
I don 't want to be critical , but ...
Yes , I know .
A week 's gone by and we haven 't got power of attorney yet .
- Yes , but you said ...
- I can 't strangle him , can I ?
It 's ridiculous for us to have to worry about a boy like that .
Look at these articles .
" Cinderella Man " .
- He 's carrying on like a idiot .
- Exactly what I was saying ...
Who cares ?
- Yeah ?
- Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting .
Let ' em wait .
They 've been in every day this week .
- Who are they ?
- Relatives of old man Semple .
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value .
- Nuisance value ?
- If not for Deeds , they 'd be rich .
Nuisance value . Maybe they have .
Mr. and Mrs. Semple , please .
How do you do ?
I 'm so sorry to have kept you waiting .
What was my secretary thinking , keeping you waiting this long ?
Will you have a cigar , Mr. Semple ?
Thanks .
- There 's Times Square .
- You can almost spit on it , can 't you ?
Why don 't you try ?
It 's breezy up here .
You 're worried about those articles they 're writing about you , aren 't you ?
Oh , I 'm not worrying anymore .
They 'll go on writing ' em until they get tired .
You don 't believe all that stuff , do you ?
Oh , they just do it to sell the newspapers , you know .
Yeah , I guess so .
What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure ... out of hurting each other .
Why don 't they try liking each other once in a while ?
Shall we go ?
Here 's a nice place .
Yeah .
Anyway , there aren 't any photographers around .
You said something to me when you first met me I 've thought about a great deal .
- What 's that ?
- You said I was a lady in distress .
Oh . That .
- What did you mean by that ?
- Nothing .
Have you got a ...
Are you engaged or anything ?
- No . Are you ? - No .
You don 't go out with girls very much , do you ?
- I haven 't .
- Why not ?
Oh , I don 't know .
You must 've met a lot of society girls .
Don 't you like them ?
I haven 't met anybody here that I like particularly .
They all seem to have St. Vitus ' Dance .
Except you , of course .
People here are funny .
They work so hard at living , they forget how to live .
Last night , after I left you , I was walking along ... and looking at the tall buildings ... and I got to thinkin' about what Thoreau said ...
" They created a lot of grand palaces here ... but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them " .
I 'd rather have Mandrake Falls .
- I 'm from a small town too , you know .
- Really ?
- Probably as small as Mandrake Falls .
- What do you know about that !
It 's a beautiful little town too .
Grove poplar trees right along main street .
Always smells as if it just had a bath .
- I 've often thought about going back . - You have ?
Oh , yes .
I used to have a lot of fun there .
I loved going fishing with my father .
You know , that 's funny .
He was a lot like you , my father was .
He talked like you too .
Sometimes he let me hold the line while he smoked .
We 'd just sit there for hours .
After a while , for no reason , I 'd go over , kiss him , sit in his lap .
He never said very much , but once I remember him saying ...
" No matter what happens , honey , don 't complain " .
He sounds like a person well worth knowing .
- He played in the town band too .
- He did ?
- I play the tuba .
- Yeah , I know .
- What did he play ?
- Drums .
He taught me to play some .
- He did ?
- Mm-hmm .
I can do " Swanee River " .
- Would you like to hear me ?
Let 's see , now .
Oh , I suppose you could do better .
Sure .
I can sing " Humoresque " .
I bet you don 't even know how it goes .
Sure .
You sing it over again , and I 'll do " Humoresque " with it .
You better be good .
I wonder if they want to make it a quartet .
- Ready ?
- Yeah .
Fire engines .
Fire engine !
I wanna see how they do it .
Wait for me , will you ?
Looks like the evening 's not gonna be wasted .
Hello .
What do you want ?
Captain Deeds , fire volunteer , Mandrake Falls .
Hi , Cap .
Boys , meet the captain .
- What 's the matter , hon ?
- Nothing .
What 's up , Babe ?
Something 's eatin ' you .
No , it 's nothing .
My unfailing instinct tells me something 's gone wrong with the stew .
Don 't be ridiculous .
You haven 't gotten very far , have you ?
That 's where you were an hour ago .
Let 's knock off and go down to Joe 's .
The gang 's waitin ' for us .
I can 't write it , Mabel .
I don 't know what 's the matter with me .
Uh-uh .
Yeah , she 's here .
Who wants her ?
Who ?
Oh , yes . Yes , just a moment .
It 's him .
Whatchamacallit .
The Cinderella Man .
The Cinderella Man .
Couldn 't sleep .
Kind of wanted to talk to you . Do you mind ?
No , not at all .
I couldn 't sleep either .
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me .
Huh ?
I don 't know what I 'd do without you .
You 've made up for all the fakes I 've met .
Well , that 's very nice . Thank you .
You know what I 've been doin' since I got home ?
I 've been workin ' on a poem .
It 's about you .
Sometimes it 's kind of hard for me to say things , so I write ' em .
I 'd like to read it sometime .
Maybe I 'll have it finished next time I see you .
Will I see you soon ?
Gosh , that 's swell , Mary .
Good night .
Good night .
MabeI , that guy 's either the dumbest , most imbecilic idiot in the world ... or the grandest thing alive .
- I can 't make him out . - Uh-huh .
- I 'm crucifying him .
- People have been crucified before .
Why do we have to do it ?
You started out to be a successful newspaperwoman .
- And then what ?
- Search me . Ask the Gypsies .
Here 's a guy that 's wholesome and fresh .
To us he looks like a freak .
Do you know what he told me tonight ?
When he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold .
The guy 's balmy .
Is he ?
Yeah , I thought so too .
I tried to laugh , but it stuck in my throat .
Cut it out , will ya ?
You 'll get me thinking about Charlie again .
He 's got goodness , Mabel .
Do you know what that is ?
Of course you don 't .
We 've forgotten .
We 're too busy being smart alecks .
Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing .
I beg pardon , sir .
- Madame Pomponi is on the telephone .
Madame Pomponi . She says that everything is all set for the reception .
- Don 't come in here when I 'm playing .
- But she 's on the telephone , sir . Get out .
The evil finger 's on you .
- The finger , sir ?
- Get out !
Stop !
- Did you hear that ?
- What , sir ?
Why , that 's an echo , sir .
- You try it .
- Me , sir ?
Louder .
- You try it .
- Me , sir ?
Louder .
You try it .
All together .
Again .
Let that be a lesson to you .
Go back to your rooms , both of you .
Hello , darling .
- So good of you to come .
- Oh , Madame Pomponi .
- I 'm so happy to have you here .
- I 'm dying to see the Cinderella Man .
- Shh .
He may hear you .
- Even if he did , he wouldn 't understand .
Bad as that , eh ?
I hear he still believes in Santa Claus .
Will he be Santa Claus ?
That 's what I wonder .
Are your slippers ready for the Cinderella Man ?
- Think he 'll go for that ? - Don 't be bashful .
With 20 million dollars , he doesn 't have to have looks .
He won 't have it long with that Pomponi woman hanging around him .
My dears , I hear that he can 't think unless he plays his tuba .
You 're a fool , Babe .
I just couldn 't stand seeing him again .
Running away is no solution .
What 'll I tell him if he calls up ?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly .
Got a job in China , someplace .
- You 're acting like a schoolgirl .
- What else can I do ?
Keeping this up 's no good .
He 's bound to find out sometime .
At least I can save him that .
- Where is everybody ?
- Come on , Babe .
The artillery 's ready .
It 's those two sore spots again .
- Should 've been down to the office .
- Yeah . Mac threw Cobb out again .
- Boy , was he burning .
- Just a minute . No , you don 't .
Just one little drink , and then we 're ready to shoo .
- We 're not going out tonight .
- I thought you had a date with him .
It 's off .
He 's having a party at his house .
- Say , what 's the matter with her now ?
- You wouldn 't know if I drew a diagram .
- Run along .
Peddle your little tintypes .
- Say , what is this ?
Throwing us out of here is getting to be a regular habit .
Is Mary Dawson here ?
I 'm Longfellow Deeds . Yes .
Of course .
Longfellow Deeds .
Come in . Step in , please .
You 're Mabel , her sister , aren 't you ?
Yes . Yes .
Of course . Her sister .
Yes , I 've been her sister a long time .
- Is she home ?
- Yeah .
What ?
- Is Mary home ?
- Oh , Mary .
Yes , of course .
I don 't know whether she 's home or not .
I 'll see .
There she is .
- Hello .
- Hello , Mary .
I waited in the park over an hour .
I thought maybe you 'd forgotten .
I didn 't think you could come , with the party and everything .
I wouldn 't let them stop me from seeing you , so I threw them out .
- You threw them out ?
- You mean , by the neck or something ?
Sure .
They got on my nerves , so I threw them out .
That 'll be in the papers tomorrow , give them something else to laugh at .
I don 't mind , though .
I had a lot of fun doing it .
- Would you like to go for a walk ?
- Yeah , if it isn 't too late .
I 'll get my hat .
Nice day out ...
Nice night , wasn 't it ... isn 't it ?
Yes .
Lovely .
Had a lot of nice weather lately .
Yeah .
It 'd be a nice night to go for a walk , don 't you think ?
Yeah , I think it 'd be a swell night to go for a walk .
A nice long one .
- Ready ?
- Gosh .
- She looks better every time I see her .
- Thank you .
Good night .
Don 't worry . I won 't keep her out late .
Thank you so much .
Good night .
- My foot 's asleep .
- No , you don 't .
- Listen , she told us ...
- No more photographs .
Glad you wanted to take a walk , Mary , 'cause I wanted to talk to you .
Let 's just walk , hmm ?
All right .
Mary , I 'm going home .
Are you ?
When ?
A day or so , I think .
- I don 't blame you .
- A man ought to know where he fits in .
I just don 't fit in around here .
I once had an idea I could do something with the money ... but they kept me so busy I haven 't had time to figure it out .
I guess I 'll wait till I get back home .
Do you mind if I talk to you , Mary ?
You don 't have to pay any attention .
No , I don 't mind .
All my life I 've wanted somebody to talk to .
Back in Mandrake Falls , I used to always talk to a girl .
- A girl ?
- Only an imaginary one .
I used to hike a lot through the woods , and I 'd always take this girl with me ... so I could talk to her .
I 'd show her my pet trees and things .
It sounds kind of silly , but we had a lot of fun doing it .
She was beautiful .
I haven 't married , 'cause I 've been kind of waiting .
You know , my mother and father were a great couple .
I thought I might have the same kind of luck .
I 've always hoped that someday that imaginary girl ... would turn out to be real .
Well , here we are again .
Yes , here we are again .
Good night .
Good night .
Excuse me .
Good-bye , darling .
Don 't let anybody hurt you again , ever .
They can 't anyway .
You 're much too real .
You go back to Mandrake Falls .
It 's where you belong .
Good-bye .
You know the poem I told you about ?
It 's finished .
Would you like to read it ?
It 's to you . Yes .
Of course .
You don 't have to say anything , Mary .
You can tell me tomorrow what you think .
" I tramped the Earth with hopeless feet ... searching in vain for a glimpse of you .
Then heaven thrust you at my very feet ... a lovely angel , too lovely to woo .
My dream has been answered , but my life 's just as bleak .
I 'm handcuffed and speechless in your presence divine .
For my heart longs to cry out .
If it only could speak .
I love you , my angel .
Be mine .
Be mine " .
Oh , darling .
You don 't have to say anything now . I 'll wait till tomorrow to hear from you .
What 's the big idea ?
Stop it , Babe .
Stop it .
What do you mean , you 're quitting ?
You might as well tell me I 'm quitting .
What 's bothering you ?
Last night he proposed to me .
Proposed to you ?
You mean , he asked you to marry him ?
- Yes .
- Why , Babe ! That 's terrific !
" Cinderella Man woos mystery girl .
Who is the myster ... "
Print one line of that and I 'll blow your place up . Sorry , Babe .
Sorry . I just got carried away .
That 's too bad .
That would 've made a swell story .
So , he proposed to you ?
What a twist .
You set out to nail him , and he ...
Yeah . Funny twist , isn 't it ?
You haven 't gone and fallen for that mug , have you ?
Well , I 'll be . That 's tough .
- What are you going to do ?
- I 'm going to tell him the truth .
Tell him you 're Babe Bennett ?
Tell him you 've been making a stooge out of him ?
I 'm having lunch with him today .
He expects an answer .
- It 's going to be pretty .
- You 're crazy .
You can 't do that .
He 'll probably kick me right down the stairs .
I hope he does .
I 'll put you on another job .
You need never see him again .
That 's the rub .
It 's as bad as that ?
Telling him 's the long shot . I 'm going to take it .
Well , it was fun while it lasted , Mac .
I 'll clean out my desk .
- How 's it going ?
- Yes . Quite all right . Thank you , sir .
- Gold ?
- Yes , sir .
- Fourteen karat .
- Yes , sir .
- Is that the best you got ?
- Yes , sir .
Those flowers are too high .
I won 't be able to see her .
- Get a smaller bowl , will you ?
- A smaller bowl of flowers , yes .
- Yes , sir .
A smaller bowl of flowers .
- Did you get that stuff ?
- Stuff , sir ?
- Yeah , that goo that tastes like soap .
Yes , sir .
Here it is .
The pate de foie gras , sir .
Have a lot of it , ' cause she likes it . - Yes .
- Now you got the idea .
That 's fine .
Sit over there , will you ?
- Me , sir ?
- Yeah .
You 're too tall .
Slink lower , will you ?
Yes .
More .
Now forward .
How is this , sir ?
Perfect .
I wish you luck , sir .
Thank you .
Now , don 't touch a thing .
Leave everything as it is .
Yes .
- Where are you ?
- What is it , sir ?
Anything happened ?
" Anything happened ? " I got to get dressed .
I can 't meet her like this .
- But she isn 't due for an hour , sir .
- What 's an hour ?
Time flies .
- My tie ?
- Yes , very good , sir .
Yes , sir .
Just as I suspected , wise guy .
I don 't mind you making a sap out of yourself , but you made one of me too .
Will you tell the gentleman I 'm not in ?
Mary Dawson , hmm ?
Mary Dawson , my eye .
That dame took you for a sleigh ride New York will laugh about for years .
She 's the slickest two-timing , double-crossing ...
- What are you talking about ?
- Go ahead . Sock away .
And then try to laugh this off .
She 's the star reporter on the Mail .
Every time you opened your kisser , you gave her another story .
She 's the dame who slapped that moniker on you :
Cinderella Man .
You 've been making love to a double dose of cyanide .
Shut up !
Listen , Babe . I can 't let you quit now .
Are you going through with this ?
This is for you , Mac .
Names of all the head waiters in town .
You can always buy a better choice of scandal from them at reasonable prices .
I 've seen them get in a rut like you before , but they always come back .
Hello ?
Yes ?
Just a minute .
It 's for you .
A couple of weeks , you 'll get the itch so bad you 'll be working for nothing . - Hello ?
- Babe Bennett ?
Just a minute .
- Hello , Mary ?
- Hello , darling .
Is it you who 's been writing those articles about me ?
Why , I was just leaving .
I 'll be up there in a minute .
Look ...
Yes , I did , but I was just coming up to explain .
Listen , darling .
Wait a minute . Please .
Listen .
I beg pardon , sir .
Should I serve the wine with the squab , sir ?
I beg pardon , sir ?
If I knew you were going to take it so hard , I would 've kept my mouth shut .
Sorry .
Pack my things , Walter . I 'm going home .
Yes , sir .
You shouldn 't be running away like this .
What 's going to happen to the estate ?
They can have the estate .
Nobody 's going to kick me out .
Let me go !
I want to see that guy !
Let me go !
I want to see him !
There he is .
I just want to get a look at him .
There you are . I just wanted to see what kind of a man you were .
I wanted to see what a man looked like that could spend thousands on a party ... while people around him were hungry .
The Cinderella Man ?
Did you think how many families could have been fed ... on the money you pay out to get on the front pages ? - Let me alone !
- Let him alone .
If you know what 's good for you , you 'll let me get this off my chest .
How did you feel feeding donuts to a horse ?
Got a kick out of it ?
Got a big laugh ?
Did you ever think of feeding donuts to human beings ?
- Shall I call the police , sir ? - No !
What do you want ?
Yeah , that 's all that 's worrying you :
What do I want ?
A chance to feed a wife and kids .
I 'm a farmer .
A job . - That 's what I want .
- A farmer ?
You 're a moocher .
I wouldn 't believe you or anybody else on a stack of Bibles .
You 're a moocher like all the rest of them around here , so get out .
Sure , everybody 's a moocher to you .
A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you .
- This won 't do you any good .
- Stay where you are ! Get over there !
You 're about to get some more publicity , Mr. Deeds .
You 're about to get on the front page again .
See how you 're going to like it this time .
What good 's your money when you 're six feet under ?
You never thought of that .
All you ever thought of was pinching pennies , you money-grabbing hick .
You never gave a thought to all of those starving people in the bread lines ... not knowing where their next meal was coming from ... not able to feed their wife and kids .
Not able to ...
I 'm glad I didn 't hurt nobody .
Excuse me .
Crazy .
You get all kinds of crazy ideas .
Sorry .
I didn 't know what I was doing .
Losing your farm after 20 years ' work .
Seeing your kids go hungry .
Game little wife saying everything 's going to be all right .
Standing there in the bread lines .
It killed me to take a handout .
I ... I ain 't used to it .
Go ahead and do what you want with me , mister .
I guess I 'm at the end of my rope .
Could I take some of this home with me ?
- Are you married ?
- Yes , sir .
- Any children ?
- No children .
All right , Mr. Dodsworth .
I think you 'll qualify . Take this to that desk over there for further instructions .
- Thank you very much .
- Next , please .
- How many does that make ?
- You 've okayed 819 .
- Is that all ? It 's going awfully slow .
- That 's all .
We need 1,100 more .
Hello ?
Yes .
Yeah .
The water development seems okay .
I don 't like the road layout .
Come up tonight about 10 : 00 and bring the maps .
Right .
Here 's the order for the plows .
We got a good price on them .
That 's fine .
Thanks .
I 'll look them over later .
Mr. Deeds , my wife wanted me to tell you she prays for you every night .
I ...
Well , thanks .
- How do you do ?
What is your name ?
- George Rankin , sir .
No , no , we 're not buying any bulls .
What 's that ?
Listen , fellow .
Bull 's what I 've been selling all my life .
We 've little time . He 's ordered me to turn everything over to him immediately .
We have to work fast , before he disposes of every penny .
See , I told you something could be done . I knew it all the time .
Sign it , dear .
- We may get into trouble .
- Don 't be so squeamish .
There 's millions involved . After all , you have your legal rights .
- You 're his only living relative .
- What 's it say ?
That 's your agreement with Mr. Cedar in case we win .
My end is going to be rather expensive .
I have important people to take care of .
I have the legal machinery ready to go .
I 've been working on nothing else .
You say the word , and we 'll stop this yokel dead in his tracks .
- Sign it !
- All right .
- Charlie , we 're off .
Papers all set ?
- All set .
- Go to it .
Charlie ? - Yeah ?
Find out who wrote those articles and subpoena him right away .
- So what is your name ?
- Christian Swenson .
- Farmer ?
- Yes , ma 'am .
- Where is your farm ?
- South Dakota , north .
- South Dakota North ? - South Dakota , but on the top .
- What about knocking off for lunch ?
- Not hungry .
I want to get through this work in a hurry , and then I want to go home .
Come on . What are you trying to do , keel over ?
You haven 't been out of this house in two weeks .
Maybe I 'll have a sandwich .
Do you mind waiting a few minutes ?
Sure . If you like to have a sandwich ...
Thanks .
Thank you .
Never mind , Cobb .
Good .
- Get lunches for the rest of them .
- What ?
There must be 2,000 of them out there .
- That doesn 't make them less hungry .
- Okay , Santa Claus . 2,000 lunches .
Say something .
Go ahead .
Tell him . Mr. Deeds , the boys here wanted me to say a little something .
They just wanted me to say that ...
They wanted me to say that we think you 're swell .
And that 's no baloney .
- Say something more .
- Give me a chance , fellows .
We 're all down and out .
A fellow like you comes along , it gives us hope . - Break it up .
Get back . - They just wanted me to say that I 've ...
That 's him .
- Are you Longfellow Deeds ?
Sheriff 's office .
We got a warrant to take you into custody .
- A what ?
- A warrant for your arrest .
- What 's up ? What do you wonks want ? - I don 't know nothing .
All I know is the sheriff gives me an insanity warrant to execute .
Insanity ? Who says he 's insane ?
The complainant is a relative of the late Martin Semple .
The charges are that Mr. Deeds is insane and incapable of handling the estate .
Somebody got panic-stricken ?
Where do you think you 're going to take him ?
- County Hospital .
- Of course , that 's only temporary .
The hearing will follow immediately .
That 's fine .
Just because I want to give this money to people who need it ... they think I 'm crazy .
That 's marvelous .
- Let 's get it going .
- Wait . We 're going to get a lawyer .
- I 'll call Cedar .
- Don 't bother .
I 'm from Mr. Cedar 's office . He represents the complainant .
- Let 's go .
We 're wasting time . - All right . I 'll go .
But get your hands off me .
Come on .
Get back .
Step back .
Boss , everybody in town has been here to see him .
Yes , sir . I will . Good-bye .
Sorry , lady .
It 's you again .
- Please . I 've got to see him . - Listen , sister .
For the 14th and last time , he don 't want to see nobody .
- Will you just give him my name ?
- Listen , toots .
Just between us , there isn 't a thing in the world the matter with that guy ... till I mention your name ; then he goes haywire .
What are you going to do ?
Sit back and let them railroad you ?
It 's as pretty a frame-up as ever hit this rotten town .
If you 'd just let me get you a lawyer .
You can 't walk into that courtroom without being ready to protect yourself .
Cedar 's too smart .
With the talent he 's got lined up against you , you 'll cook .
Listen , pal . I know just how you feel .
A blonde in Syracuse put me through the same paces .
I came out with a sour puss , but full of fight .
Come on .
You don 't want to lay down now .
They 're trying to prove you 're nuts . They 'll shove you in the bug house .
The moment they accused you of it , they had you half licked .
You 've got to fight .
Go on . Sit down , won 't you ?
Yes .
So long , Mr. Cobb .
Corny , listen , I 've got to see him .
I 've got to talk to him .
Haven 't you done enough damage already ?
Somebody 's got to help him .
He hasn 't a chance against Cedar .
I 've been talking to everybody . I 've got Mac lined up and the paper 's behind him .
I can get Livingston too .
With a lawyer like Livingston , he 's got a chance .
You 're wasting your time .
He doesn 't want any lawyers .
He 's so low , he doesn 't want anybody 's help .
You can take a bow for that .
As swell a guy as ever hit this town and you crucified him for some headlines .
You 've done your bit .
Now stay out of his way .
There he is now .
Here he is .
Cedar just sent for me . He wants to make a settlement .
Here 's your chance to get out of the whole mess . What do you say ?
Rise , please .
Supreme Court , State of New York , County of New York now in session ... the Honorable Judge May presiding .
Be seated .
The court wishes to warn those present it will tolerate no disturbances .
Regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow Deeds ...
You represented by counsel , Mr. Deeds ?
I understand you have no counsel . In fact , that you have no intention of defending any of these charges .
Now , if you wish to change your mind , the hearing can be postponed .
Crazy .
Proceed .
In the interest of my client , the only other living relative ... of the late Martin W. Semple ... we cannot permit a fortune so huge to be dissipated by a person ... whose incompetency and abnormality we shall prove beyond any reasonable doubt .
I have before me a series of articles written by a newspaperwoman ... who was an eyewitness to this conduct ever since he came to New York .
She tells how in the midst of a normal conversation ... he would suddenly begin playing his tuba .
She tells of his attack upon several of our eminent writers for no reason .
I , myself , unable to keep pace with his mental quirks and fearful of assault ... turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney .
This newspaperwoman , whom we have subpoenaed to testify ... tells how he held up traffic for an hour feeding donuts to a poor horse .
We have photographs to substantiate this little episode . Another photograph showing Mr. Deeds jumping about a fire engine .
This scarcely sounds like the action of a man ... in whom the disposition of $ 20 million may safely be entrusted .
The writer of these articles , a woman ... whose intelligence and integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned ... held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him the Cinderella Man .
We have witnesses here from Mandrake Falls ... his own hometown , who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime ... proving that his derangement is neither a recent nor a temporary one .
We have others who will tell of his unusual behavior ... when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his home ... and then proceeded to forcibly eject them .
- I hope he can explain that .
- Yes .
Only recently , when he was in the County Hospital for observation ... he not only refused to be examined by these gentlemen ... state psychiatrists ... but he actually made a violent attack upon them .
In these times , with the country incapacitated by economic ailments ... and in danger with an undercurrent of social unrest ... the promulgation of such a weird , fantastic and impractical plan ... as contemplated by the defendant ... is capable of fomenting a disturbance ... from which the country may not soon recover .
It is our duty to stop it .
Our government is fully aware of its difficulties .
It can pull itself out of its economic rut ... without the assistance of Mr. Deeds or any other crackpot .
His attempted action must therefore be attributed ... to a diseased mind , afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur ... and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor .
Your Honor , we would like to call our first witness , Louise " Babe " Bennett .
Miss Bennett , please .
Raise your right hand , please .
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth , so help you God ?
- I do .
- State your right name .
- Louise Bennett .
- Take the stand .
Miss Bennett , are you employed by the Morning Mail ?
- I ask you direct your attention to me .
- Your Honor , this is ridiculous .
- Please answer the question .
- The whole hearing 's ridiculous .
- That man 's no more insane than you .
- Outrageous !
It 's obviously a frame-up .
They 're trying to railroad this man for money .
Young lady , another outburst like that , and I shall hold you in contempt .
We are not interested in your opinion of this case .
You are to here to testify .
Sit down and answer questions .
Proceed .
Thank you , Your Honor .
Are you employed by the Morning Mail ?
You 're under oath , Miss Bennett .
Again , are you employed by the Morning Mail ?
I resigned last week .
Prior to that time , were you employed by the Morning Mail ?
- Were you given an assignment ... to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds ?
- Yes .
- Did you subsequently write about him ?
- Yes .
- Are these the articles ?
- Yes .
- Were you present ?
- Yes .
- Are they true ?
They did take place ?
- They 're colored to make him look silly .
- You saw them happen ?
- Yes , but ...
- That 's all .
It isn 't all . I 'd like to explain .
- I submit these articles as evidence .
- Let go !
What kind of hearing is this ?
What are you trying to do ? Persecute the man ?
He 's not defending himself . Somebody 's got to do it .
- Please .
- I 've got a right to be heard .
I 've attended dozens of cases like this .
They 're conducted without any formality .
Anybody can be heard .
My opinion 's as good as these quack psychiatrists ' .
I know him better than they do .
If you have quite finished , I should like to inform you ... that one more utterance from you , and I shall place you under arrest .
I 'm willing to hear anything anyone has to say ... but I insist on it being done in an orderly fashion .
When you have learned to show some respect for this court , you may return .
Until then , you 'd better go back to your seat and calm down .
This way , miss .
Order in the court .
Mr. Deeds , have you anything to say in defense of these articles ?
Mark these Exhibit " A " for the plaintiff .
Yes , Your Honor .
Proceed .
They 're rather timid , Your Honor , and wish to be together .
If the court pleases , I 'll only have one testify .
- Yes . Get on with it .
- What is your name , please ?
- Jane Faulkner .
This is my sister Amy .
- Yes .
Amy .
I 'll direct my questions to you , Miss Jane .
You may answer for both .
Do you know the defendant ?
Yes . Of course we know him .
How long have you known him ?
- Since he was born . - Yes .
Elsie Taggart was the midwife .
- He was a seven-months baby .
- Thank you .
That 's fine .
Do you see him very often ?
- Most every day .
- Sometimes twice .
- Must we have the echo ?
- Suppose you just answer , Miss Jane .
Will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds ?
- They think he 's pixilated .
- Yes . Pixilated .
- He 's what ?
- What was that you said he was ?
- Pixilated .
- That 's rather a strange word to us .
- Can you tell the court what it means ?
- Perhaps I can explain , Your Honor .
The word " pixilated " is an early-American expression ... derived from the word " pixies " , meaning " elves " .
They 'd say , " The pixies had got him " , as we 'd nowadays say a man is " balmy " .
Is that correct ?
Why does everyone think he 's pixilated ?
Does he do peculiar things ?
He walks in the rain without his hat and talks to himself .
- Sometimes he whistles .
- And sings .
Anything else ?
- He gave Chuck Dillon a thumping .
- Blacked his eye .
- Why ?
- For no reason , I guess .
He always does it .
We run into the house when we see him coming .
Never can tell what he 's going to do .
- He sure is pixilated .
- Yes . He 's pixilated , all right .
Thank you , ladies .
That 's all .
They kept hollering , " Back to nature ! "
I thought they looked harmless enough , so I took them home .
I never thought he was cracked .
I 'm a waiter .
He kept pressing me to point out the celebrities .
I said , " Help me " . I 'm coming out of the kitchen a couple of minutes later ... and there he is mopping up the floors with them .
I never figured he was a guy that was looking for trouble .
He threw us out bodily , but bodily !
We was hired as his bodyguard , see ?
The first crack out of the box ... he throws us in a room and locks the door , see ?
If a thing like that gets around in our profession , we get the bird , see ?
So I says to my partner , " Let 's quit this guy .
He 's nuts ! "
I 'm very fond of Clarissa .
She 's a nice horse .
And when this bloke here started feeding her donuts ...
I yelled down to him , " Mind what you 're doing down there " .
I wouldn 't mind , sir , but Clara won 't eat nothin ' but donuts now .
And now , if the court pleases , I shall call upon Dr. Emil Von Hallor ... if he 'll be good enough to give us his opinion .
Dr. Von Hallor is the eminent Austrian psychiatrist ... probably the greatest authority on the subject in the world .
At present , he 's in this country on a lecture tour ... and has graciously volunteered his services .
Do you swear the testimony you give in the cause now before this court ... shall be the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ? - State your right name , please .
- Emil Von Hallor .
Take the stand .
Dr. Von Hallor , would you tell the court what your opinion is of this case ?
This is purely a case of manic depression .
A case of this kind , patients sometimes go on for years ... before being detected .
You remember , Dr. Fosdick , in my last book ... there were some very fine examples , especially the young nobleman .
- You remember ? - Yes , Dr. Von Hallor .
Very interesting .
It reminds me very much of this one .
It takes so long to detect them ... because their mood changes so often and so quickly .
Now , Your Honor , may I show you ?
May I use the chart ?
By all means .
Below here , they are extremely depressed ... melancholy , impossible to live with and often become violent .
From this mood ... the manic depressive might gradually change ... until they reach this state .
Here is lucidity .
Here they are normal , as normal as you or I.
Assuming , of course , that we are normal .
Then the mood changes again ... until they reach this state ... a state of highest exultation .
Here , everything is fine . Here , the world is beautiful .
Here , they are so elated ...
How to express it ?
They would give you the shirts off their backs .
How would you say that applied to Mr. Deeds ' case ?
The symptoms are obvious .
When he was here , on top of the wave ... he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth for his fellow man .
He wanted to have them around him , so he decided to give a big reception .
But in the meantime , his mood has changed .
He 's now at the bottom of the wave :
depressed , melancholy .
So when his guests arrive , he throws them out .
They are now his imaginary enemies .
Other instances of high elations are ... when he plays his tuba , when he writes his poetry ... when he chases fire engines in a desire to help humanity .
This is contrasted with his present mood ... which is so low that even the instinct for self-preservation is lacking .
Your Honor , this is decidedly a case of manic depression .
Thank you very much , Doctor .
Your Honor , we rest .
What are you going to do , let them get away with it ?
They 've got you cooked .
He 's sunk .
Before the court arrives at a decision , isn 't there anything you wish to say ?
Come on .
Don 't be a sap .
- You both concur ?
- Absolutely .
All right .
In view of the extensive testimony , your continued silence ... and on the recommendation of the doctors ... the court considers it advisable , for your own safety ... that you be committed to an institution ... as prescribed by law .
You need medical attention , Mr. Deeds .
Perhaps in a little while ...
Wait a minute .
You can 't do it . You 've got to make him talk .
- Your Honor , I object .
- Please . I know how horrible I 've been .
No matter what happens ... if you never see me again ... do this for me .
- Please .
- You said I could speak .
You said I could have my say if I were rational .
I 'm rational . Please let me take the witness chair .
He must be made to defend himself before you arrive at a decision .
- Take the stand .
- Thank you .
Your Honor , what she is saying has no bearing on the case .
I object . - Let her speak .
- I know why he won 't defend himself . That has a bearing on the case , hasn 't it ?
He 's been hurt .
He 's been hurt by everybody he 's met since he came here , principality by me .
He 's been the victim of every conniving crook in town .
The newspapers pounced on him , made him a target for their feeble humor .
I was smarter than the rest of them .
I got closer so I could laugh louder .
Why shouldn 't he keep quiet ?
Every time he said anything ... it was twisted around to sound imbecilic .
He can thank me for it .
I handed the gang a grand laugh .
It 's a fitting climax to my sense of humor .
- Your Honor , this is preposterous .
- Certainly I wrote those articles .
I was going to get a raise , a month 's vacation .
But I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about ... when I realized how real he was .
He could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint ... because he 's honest and sincere and good .
If that man 's crazy ... the rest of us belong in straitjackets !
This is absurd . The woman 's obviously in love with him .
- What 's that got to do with it ?
- You are in love with him , aren 't you ? - What 's that got to do with it ?
- You are , aren 't you ? - Yes !
- Her testimony 's of no value .
Why shouldn 't she defend him ?
It 's typical of American womanhood . Protect the weak .
I 'm not saying nobody likes the boy .
I have a fond affection for him myself .
- But that doesn 't mean to say ...
- I can verify what Miss Bennett said .
I 'm her editor .
When she quit , she told me what a swell fellow this man was ... and anything Babe Bennett says is okay with me .
If you have anything to say , you will take the stand .
I 've already said it , Your Honor .
I just thought I 'd like to get my two cents in .
Don 't be a sucker , pal .
Stand up and speak your piece .
- Your Honor , I 've got a couple of cents .
- Sit down .
I 've been with this man ever since he came to New York .
Sit down !
There will be no further interruptions .
- How about us , Mr. Deeds ?
- Yes , what about us , Mr. Deeds ?
- Order in the court !
- You 're going to leave us in the cold ?
They 're trying to frame you .
- Stop this . - Order !
Order .
In the interest of Mr. Deeds , I have tolerated a great deal of informality .
But if there is one more outburst , I shall have the courtroom cleared .
- Your Honor ?
- Yes ?
I 'd like to get in my two cents ' worth .
Take the stand .
Proceed .
I don 't know where to begin .
There have been so many things said about me that ...
About my playing the tuba .
It seems like a lot of fuss has been made about that .
If a man 's crazy just because he plays the tuba ... then somebody 'd better look into it ... because there are a lot of tuba players running around loose .
I don 't see any harm in it .
I play mine whenever I want to concentrate .
That may sound funny to some people ... but everybody does something silly when they 're thinking .
For instance , the judge here ... is an " O " filler .
- A what ?
- An " O " filler .
You fill in all the spaces in the O 's with your pencil . I was watching .
That may make you look a little crazy , Your Honor ... just sitting around , filling in O 's ... but I don 't see anything wrong , 'cause that helps you think .
- Other people are doodlers .
- Doodlers ?
Yeah , that 's a name we made up back home ... for people who make foolish designs on paper when they 're thinking .
It 's called doodling .
Almost everybody 's a doodler .
Did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth ?
People draw the most idiotic pictures when they 're thinking .
Dr. Von Hallor here could probably think up a long name for it ... because he doodles all the time .
Thank you .
This is a piece of paper he was scribbling on .
I can 't figure it out . One minute it looks like a chimpanzee .
The next minute it looks like a picture of Mr. Cedar .
You look at it .
Exhibit " A " for the defense .
Looks kind of stupid , doesn 't it ?
But I guess that 's all right .
If Dr. Von Hallor has to doodle to help him think ... that 's his business .
Everybody does something different .
Some people are ear pullers .
Some are nail biters .
That Mr. Semple over there ... is a nose twitcher .
The lady next to him is a knuckle cracker .
So you see , everybody does silly things to help them think .
Well , I play the tuba .
- Nice work , toots !
- Order in this court !
This is becoming farcical .
I demand Mr. Deeds ... dispense with side remarks and confine himself to facts .
Let him explain his wanderings around the street in his underclothes ... his feeding donuts to horses . Please .
Proceed .
Mr. Cedar 's right .
Those things do look kind of bad , don 't they ?
But to tell you the truth , Your Honor , I don 't remember them .
I guess they happened , because I don 't think a policeman ... would lie about a thing like that , but I was drunk .
It was the first time I was ever drunk .
It 's probably happened to you some time .
I mean , when you were younger , of course .
It 's likely to happen to anybody .
Just the other morning , I read in the paper about Mr. Cedar 's own son ... how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxicab while the driver sat inside .
Isn 't that so ?
- Your Honor , I object .
- Proceed .
Now , about the Faulkner sisters .
That 's funny , Mr. Cedar going to Mandrake Falls to bring them here .
- Do you mind if I talk to them ? - Not at all .
Who owns the house you live in ?
- Why , you own it , Longfellow .
- Yes , you own it .
- Do you pay any rent ?
- No , we don 't pay any rent .
Good heavens , no .
- We never pay rent .
- Are you happy there ?
- Oh , yes .
- Yes , indeed .
Now , Jane , a little while ago you said I was pixilated .
Do you still think so ?
Why , you 've always been pixilated , Longfellow .
- Always .
- That 's fine .
I guess maybe I am .
Now , tell me something , Jane .
Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated ?
Why , everybody in Mandrake Falls is pixilated , except us .
Now , just one more question .
You see the judge here .
He 's a nice man , isn 't he ?
- Do you think he 's pixilated ?
- Yes .
Yes , indeed .
You haven 't yet touched upon the most important point :
this rather fantastic idea of yours to give away your entire fortune .
It is , to say the least , most uncommon . Yes .
Yes , I was getting to that , Your Honor .
Suppose you were living in a small town and getting along fine ... and suddenly somebody dropped $ 20 million in your lap .
Supposing you discover all that money was messing up your life ... was bringing vultures around your neck and making you lose faith in everybody .
You 'd be worried , wouldn 't you ?
You 'd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand , and you 'd want to drop it .
I guess Dr. Von Hallor here would say you were riding on those bottom waves ... because you wanted to drop something that was burning your fingers .
If this man is permitted to carry out his plan , repercussions will be felt ... that will rock the foundation of our entire governmental systems .
Please , Mr. Cedar .
Proceed .
Personally , I don 't know what Mr. Cedar is raving about .
From what I can see , no matter what system of government we have ... there 'll always be leaders and always be followers .
It 's like the road out in front of my house . It 's on a steep hill .
Every day , I watch the cars climbing up .
Some go lickety-split up that hill on high ; some have to shift into second .
Some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again .
Same cars , same gasoline , yet some make it and some don 't .
I say the fellows who can make the hill should stop and help those who can 't .
That 's all I 'm trying to do : help fellows who can 't make the hill on high .
What does Mr. Cedar expect me to do with it ?
Give it to him and a lot of other people who don 't need it ?
If you don 't mind , Your Honor , I 'll ride on those top waves for a minute .
All you fellows up there , all those who applied for a farm , stand up .
See all those fellows ?
They 're the ones I 'm trying to help . They need it .
Mr. Cedar and Mr. Semple don 't need anything .
They 've got plenty .
It 's like I 'm out in a big boat , and I see one fellow in a rowboat ... who 's tired of rowing and wants a free ride and another who 's drowning .
Who would you expect me to rescue ?
Mr. Cedar , who wants a free ride ?
Or those men out there who are drowning ?
Any ten-year-old child will give you the answer to that .
Thank you . Sit down .
Now , my plan was very simple .
I was gonna give each family 10 acres , a horse , a cow and some seed ... and if they worked the farm for three years , it 's theirs .
Now , if that 's crazy , maybe I ought to be sent to an institution ... but I don 't think it is , and Mr. Cedar doesn 't either .
Before the hearing , he offered to call everything off if I made a settlement .
So you see , he wouldn 't think I was crazy if he got paid off .
It 's a lie growing in his warped imagination .
I never heard anything so colossally stupid in my life .
It 's an insult to our intelligence to sit and listen to such childish ravings .
- You will permit Mr. Deeds to finish . - But , Your Honor ...
- Anything else , Mr. Deeds ?
Yes . There is one more thing I 'd like to get off my chest before I finish .
- Proceed .
- Thank you , Your Honor .
Order this man back to his chair !
Order !
Remain seated and come to order .
The court is again in session .
Before the court announces its decision ... I want to warn all who are here that the police have orders ... to arrest anyone creating a disturbance .
Mr. Deeds , there has been a great deal of damaging testimony against you .
Your behavior , to say the least , has been ... most strange .
But in the opinion of the court , you are not only sane ... but you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom .
Case dismissed .
You nose twitcher .
I knew it .
You ...
- He 's still pixilated .
- He sure is .
If them cops would stick to their own racket , we 'd get somewhere in this country ... without a lot of this relief and all that stuff .
Mike , I wouldn 't worry .
Prosperity 's just around the corner .
Yeah . It 's been there a long time . I wish I knew which corner .
Well , Duke , I 'm gonna turn in .
- Bonsoir . - Bonsoir , Mike .
This is the place , all right .
That looks like one of them .
- Looks pretty tough to me .
- Stall Irene . I 'll talk to the fellow .
- Good evening .
- How 'd you like to make five dollars ?
Huh ?
I didn 't quite catch what you said .
I said , how 'd you like to make five dollars ?
- Five dollars ?
[ Chuckles ] Well , I don 't want to seem inquisitive , but what would I have to do for it ?
All you have to do is go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me ,
I 'll show you to a few people , and then I 'll send you right back .
May I inquire just why you would want ... to show me to people at the Waldorf Ritz ?
Oh , if you must know , it 's a game ... a scavenger hunt . If I find a forgotten man first , I win .
Is that clear ? Yes , quite clear .
Shall I wear my tails , or come just as I am ? You needn 't be fresh .
Do you want the five dollars or don 't you ?
Madam , I can 't tell you how flattered I am ... by your very generous offer .
However , I 'll have to take it up with my board of directors .
- Don 't you touch me ! - No matter what my directors advise ,
- I think you should be spanked .
- George , do something ! Are you in the habit of hitting ladies ?
I 'm in the habit of hitting gentlemen also , if that 'll interest you .
- Aren 't you going to do anything ? - Let 's get a policeman .
[ Ship 's Whistle Blowing ]
- Who are you ? - I 'm Irene .
That was my sister Cornelia you pushed in the ash pile .
- Like me to push Cornelia 's sister ? - I don 't think I 'd like that . - Then you 'd better get out of here .
- Oh , you bet . Wait a minute !
Sit down ! I 'm sitting .
What 's up , Duke ?
Need some help ?
No , thanks , boys . Got everything under control .
Are you a member of this hunting party ?
I was , but I 'm not now .
Are they all forgotten men too ?
Yes , I guess they are , maybe .
I couldn 't help but laugh .
I 've wanted to do that since I was six years old .
- You wanted to what ?
- Oh , push Cornelia in a pile of ashes .
That was Faithful George with her .
That isn 't really his name .
He gets in everybody 's hair .
His father 's the broker .
That 's very enlightening .
Cornelia thought she was going to win , and you pushed her .
[ Laughing ]
Could follow an intelligent conversation for just a moment ?
- I 'll try .
- Well , that 's fine .
Do you mind telling me just what a scavenger hunt is ?
In a treasure hunt you try to find something you want . In a scavenger hunt you try to find something that nobody wants .
- Hmm , like a forgotten man ?
- That 's right . The one that wins gets a prize , only there really is no prize .
It 's just the honor of winning .
The money goes to charity . That is , if there 's any money left over , and there never is .
Well , that clears the whole matter up beautifully .
I 've decided I don 't want to play any more games with human beings as objects .
It 's kind of sordid when you think of it , when you think it over .
Yeah , well , I don 't know .
I haven 't thought it over .
I don 't like to change the subject , but why do you live in a place like this ?
There 's so many other nice places .
- You really want to know ? - Oh , I 'm very curious .
Because my real estate agent felt the altitude would be good for my asthma .
- Oh , my uncle has asthma . - No !
Well , now there 's a coincidence .
Well , I suppose I should be going now , shouldn 't I ?
That 's a good idea . I want to see who won the game .
I suppose it was Cornelia .
She probably got another forgotten man by now .
If you took me with you , you 'd win the game ? Is that the idea ?
Well , I might if I got there first .
But after seeing what you did to Cornelia , I 'm not saying anything .
But you 'd win if you got back first with me ?
It 'd be awfully nice of you , but I don 't like to ask .
Let 's beat Cornelia .
- It wouldn 't be asking too much ?
- Mm-mm . See , I 've got a sense of curiosity , just the same as you have .
I 'd really like to see just what a scavenger hunt looks like .
- But I told you !
- Yes . I 'm still curious .
Well , come on .
- Thank you .
- [ Phone Ringing ]
- My name 's Blake . - My name is Bullock .
Well , all you need to start an asylum ... is an empty room and the right kind of people .
That 's right .
- [ Blathering ] - [ Goat Bleats ]
Oh , good evening , Mrs. Jordan . Look what I brought with me . Oh , why , look !
- And the baby came along too !
Take a look at the dizzy old gal with the goat .
I 've had to look at her for 20 years .
That 's Mrs. Bullock . Alexander !
Alexander ! - I 'm terribly sorry . How do you think I feel ?
All right , Angelica ! Alexander , Alexander , come here .
Look at the pretty goat .
Carlo and I found him in the Bronx .
Isn 't he just sweet ? - He doesn 't smell very sweet .
- Oh , Alexander never did like animals .
Come on , goat , goat , goat .
Come on . Come on .
- Are you talking to me or that thing ? - Oh , Alexander !
Don 't be afraid of the stairs .
Angelica won 't let anything happen to you .
Quick , quick , quick . Come on .
Quick , quick .
Come on , goat , goat , goat .
Come on .
[ All Chattering ]
I have a goat ! I have a goat !
I have a goat !
Will you please pay attention to me ? I 'm Mrs. Bullock , and I have a goat .
I have a goat !
I have a goat ! I have a goat ! I have a goat !
I know you 've got a goat .
Will you please get Mrs. Bullock 's goat ? Get those things out of the way .
[ Chattering Continues ]
- I have a little baby goat .
- [ Goat Bleating ] What am I supposed to do with that ?
- What ? What else do we have to get ?
All you have to get is one forgotten man and a bowl ofjapanese goldfish .
What ? Get that thing out of the way !
What ? I said , a forgotten man and a bowl ofjapanese goldfish .
One man ...
Let 's go .
AJapanese man .
A man and a bowl ofjapanese men .
- I can 't remember what he said .
- How about going home ? - What are you talking about ?
We just have two other things to get .
A bowl ofjapanese men and a forgotten goldfish .
- Goldfish !
- I don 't know about the goldfish !
But if you want a forgotten man , you 'll find me home in bed !
I can 't concentrate , Alexander .
Come along , Carlo . Goldfish ... - Are all these people hunters ?
- Oh , no , we work in groups .
Some are hunters , and some are receivers .
- I never thought of that . - Who receives me ?
- I have to take you to the committee .
- You don 't mind , do you ?
- I can hardly wait . Wait a minute !
What have you there ?
This is Godfrey .
Is Cornelia back yet ?
I haven 't seen Cornelia .
Where did you find him ?
[ Chattering Continues ]
Oh , Mr. Guthrie !
Come on this way .
Mr. Guthrie !
- I have a forgotten man .
- [ Monkey Chittering ]
I have a forgotten man !
Mr. Guthrie , this is Godfrey .
He 's a forgotten man ! Mr. Guthrie !
- A forgotten man !
- His name is Godfrey . - A forgotten man ? You got all eight .
- Yes .
Ladies and gentlemen , please , quiet , quiet .
Miss Bullock has a forgotten man .
Do you mind stepping up on the platform , please .
Yes , get right up on the platform , Godfrey .
- Mind if I ask you a few questions ?
- Fire away . - What is your address ?
- City Dump 32 , East River , Sutton Place .
- It 's rather fashionable over there .
- In spots .
- Is that your permanent address ? - The permanency is questionable .
See , the place is being rapidly filled in .
- Mind if I ask a personal question ?
- If it isn 't too personal . - Are those whiskers your own ?
- No one else has claimed them .
I must ask that question because one group ... tried to fool the committee by trying to put false whiskers on one of their own .
- May I , uh ... May I , uh ... - What ?
Oh , it 's a pleasure . [ Clears Throat ] One more question .
Are you wanted by the police ?
Ah , that 's just the trouble . Nobody wants me .
- Oh , very good answer .
- Splendid , Godfrey .
You mean , nobody wants him ?
Nobody at all ?
- Nobody .
- Oh , that 's too bad .
On the contrary , I sometimes find it a great advantage .
The committee is satisfied .
Miss Irene Bullock ... wins 20 points for a forgotten man ... and 50 points extra for bringing in the first one .
- Oh , bravo ! - Speech ! Speech !
Group ten ...
- Speech ! Speech !
- Group ten wins the silver cup .
- Oh , thank you .
- Speech !
Speech !
- They want a speech . Come on !
- Speech !
My purpose in coming here tonight was twofold .
Firstly , I wanted to aid this young lady .
Secondly , I was curious to see ... how a bunch empty-headed nitwits conducted themselves .
- [ Crowd Murmuring ] - My curiosity is satisfied .
I assure you it will be a pleasure for me ... to go back to a society of really important people .
- What did he call us ? - Nitwits . - Nitwits ?
What are they ? - I don 't know .
[ Man ] The man 's perfect !
I 've been wanting to say that , but I didn 't have the nerve .
Oh , Godfrey ! Oh , Godfrey !
Oh , Godfrey , I 'm terribly sorry .
- That 's all right .
- I 'd never brought you here .
This is the first time I 've ever beaten Cornelia , and you helped me do it .
Well , that makes me a Cornelia beater , doesn 't it ?
You 've done something for me . I wish I could do something for you .
- Why ?
- Because you 've done something for me .
No , I don 't see .
But I could use a job , if you 've got one .
- Can you " buttle " ? - " Buttle " ? We 're fresh out of butlers .
The one we had left this morning .
Irene , they 're calling for you in the jade room .
- Don 't you want your cup ? - Tell them to keep their cup .
You can 't talk to this man .
What will people think ?
I don 't care what they think .
Godfrey 's gonna be our butler .
- He 's gonna be whose butler ?
- He 's gonna work for us .
Oh , that 's ridiculous .
You don 't know anything about him .
He hasn 't any recommendations ...
The last one had recommendations and stole all the silver .
That was merely a coincidence .
People that take in stray cats say they make the best pets .
I don 't see what cats have got to do with butlers .
You mustn 't pay any attention to my daughter .
She 's very impulsive . - I 'm not impulsive !
- Don 't shout at your mother .
- I will shout !
- Oh , Mrs. Meriwether , Irene is shouting .
- You mean it 's all over ?
- Yes , she always shouts when she wins .
Run along , my good man .
Thank you so much for coming .
Thank you so , so much .
[ Irene ] He will not run along !
[ Godfrey ] I think I 'd better .
My word !
There 's Cornelia , and she has another one !
You 're a little late , Cornelia . I 've won the game .
- Oh , you have ?
- Where do I get my five bucks ?
Bucks ? What ...
Will you talk to your sister ?
She wants to hire this man as a butler .
Why not ?
He might make a very good butler .
I 'm sure I 'd make a very good butler .
Hey , where do I get my five bucks ?
Bucks ? Bucks ?
What 's he talking about ?
What 's he talking about ? - Five bucks !
- I promised him five dollars .
Well , give him the five dollars and the bucks too , and get him out of here ... before your sister hires him as a chauffeur .
Why did I have to find out there 's insanity on your father 's side ? Come along , Cornelia .
I hope , Godfrey , that you 're very good at shining shoes .
I think we 'd better drop the whole idea , don 't you ?
I should say not .
You 're gonna make the best butler we ever had . And here .
You 'll need some clothes and things , you know .
Oh , well , I ...
[ Laughs ] I told G. To lay out my other coat .
[ Chuckles ] You have a wonderful sense of humor .
Thank you .
Well , then ... good night .
Oh , uh , just one question .
- What ?
- Where do you live ?
Oh , 1011 Fifth .
Funny , I never thought of that .
- [ Laughs ] No , you didn 't .
- No . 1011 Fifth .
Well , good night again .
Good night , Godfrey .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
- I 'm the new , uh ...
- Yes , I know .
You 're the new butler .
- How did you know ? - There 's one every day at this hour .
They 're dropping in and out all the time .
Why is that ?
Some get fired , some quit .
- Is the family that exacting ?
- May I be frank ?
- Is that your name ?
- No , my name is Godfrey .
- All right , be frank . You 're , uh , quite an enthusiast .
Don 't you worry about me .
I 'm a seasoned campaigner . [ Laughs ] Uh , may we be friends ?
Oh , I 'm friends with all the butlers .
Sit down . What 's a three-letter sea bird with an " R " in the middle ?
That 's ... Oh , I ...
I don 't know .
You 're no help .
Where 'd you get the trick suit ?
What 's the matter with it ? Well , it might look better if you took the rental tag off the coat .
[ Laughs ] Oh ... thanks .
Does the butler have quarters here in the house , or is that necessary ?
Oh , you won 't need any quarters .
Hang your hat near the door ... so you can get it quickly on the way out .
- [ Intercom Buzzes ]
- What 's that ? That 's the old battle axe .
She usually rings about this time .
- The old battle axe ?
- Mrs. Bullock .
She 's the mother type .
- Well , don 't you do anything about it ?
- Mrs. Bullock or the buzzer ?
- The buzzer . - Not the first time .
If she has a hangover , she 'll ring again in a minute in no uncertain terms .
Then , brother , you better grab her tomato juice and get going .
- Ah , there she blows .
Well , Cupid , this is your big opportunity .
Shall I take it to her ?
You might as well know the worst .
- I want to warn you , she sees pixies .
- You know , the little men .
- Oh , those .
I know how to take care of those .
Have you any Worcestershire ? What are you gonna do with that ?
Do unto others as you would have others do unto you .
What do you want to do ?
Scorch her windpipe ?
There 's nothing like a counterirritant .
Where do I find her ? You better go this way .
- Just which is her ...
- That 's her cage up there , first door . - Oh .
What day is it , Molly ?
- I 'm not Molly .
- Who isn 't ?
I 'm not .
Stop jumping up and down , so I can see who you are .
- I 'm not jumping . - That 's better .
- What 's your name ? - Godfrey .
Are you someone I know ?
We met last night at the Waldorf Ritz .
Oh , yes , you were with Mrs. Maxton 's party at the bar .
Or were you ?
I 'm the forgotten man .
[ Chuckles ] So many people have such bad memories . That 's so true .
Why do they keep playing that same tune over and over again ?
Why do they ? Don 't you hear it ?
[ Jingling Continues ]
Oh ... yes , yes , I do , in a way .
Always the same tune over and over again .
May I , uh ...
May you what ?
Where are you ?
What 's that ?
Pixie remover . Oh .
Then you see them too . We 're old friends .
Yes , but you mustn 't step on them .
I don 't like them , but I don 't like to see them stepped on .
I 'll be very careful . I wouldn 't hurt them for the world .
- What am I supposed to do with this ?
And they 'll go away very quickly . Very , very quickly .
You must never be rough with them .
You must always send them away quietly .
- Is that better ? - Yes . You 're a great help .
Go away , little men . Go away .
Shh , shh , shh . Oh , but ...
Oh , you haven 't told me who you are .
I 'm Godfrey , the forgotten man .
I 'm the new butler .
- Are you that ugly man with the beard ?
- The same . Oh , you 've changed .
I should never have known you . - Thank you . - You 're very comforting .
[ Giggles , Hiccups ]
I put your hat at the foot of the stairs .
You can go out the front way .
- I think I won the first round .
- You 're still working here ?
- Haven 't heard anything to the contrary .
- You just got by the cub . - Try the lioness .
- Oh , which is she ? Her name 's Cornelia .
She 's a sweet-tempered little number .
[ Cornelia ] Who are you , and what are you doing in here ?
I don 't want a hobo serving my breakfast !
Don 't ever come here again , if you know what 's good for you .
I 'm afraid I lost the second round .
[ Irene ] Hey , I want the new butler to bring me breakfast !
Opportunity never stops knocking in this house . Want to try again ? - How is she in the morning ?
I 'll leave your things right up here , so you won 't forget them .
Good morning .
I brought your breakfast . A-Are you the new butler ?
- Don 't you remember last night ?
- What happened to Godfrey ? - I 'm Godfrey .
- Oh , you look so different .
What happened to those nice whiskers ?
Turn around . Let me look at you .
You 're the cutest thing I 've ever seen .
Thank you . Will there be anything else ? Yes .
I like to talk in the morning ... especially if you 've been somewhere the night before .
Don 't you think it 'd be better if I talked standing ?
No . If you 're uncomfortable , I get uncomfortable ,
I get uncomfortable and forget what I have to say .
If you insist .
But it doesn 't seem in very good form for a butler . Oh , you 're more than a butler . You 're the first protege I ever had .
- You know , like Carlo . - Who is Carlo ?
- He 's Mother 's protege !
You know , it 's awfully nice Carlo having a sponsor , because he doesn 't have to work and he gets more time for his practicing .
- And that makes a difference . - Yes , I imagine it would .
Do you play anything ?
Oh , I don 't mean games . - I mean the piano and things like that .
- Well , I ...
It doesn 't really make any difference .
It 's funny how some things make you think of other things .
Yes , very peculiar .
- Makes me feel so mature and grown up .
- What does ? Having a protege . You 're the first one I ever had .
- You 've never had others ?
- You 're the first , and it 's thrilling .
Not only does it occupy my mind , but it 's character-building too .
Mm-hmm .
Just what does a protege have to do ?
Well , you just go on buttling , and I sponsor you . Don 't you see ?
Yeah , it 's getting clearer .
It 's really not much work , and it 's gonna be such fun .
[ Chuckles ] I 'm sure it 's going to be heaps of fun .
For instance , if Cornelia got mean , you wouldn 't have to do anything about it .
I 'm your sponsor , and I 'd just take a sock at her . I hope that 'll never be necessary .
I just wanted to give you the idea .
That 's fine , but a protege has certain responsibilities also .
For instance , if someone should ring for me now and I didn 't answer , that would reflect upon you because you 're my sponsor .
- Don 't you see ?
- Yes , I never thought of that .
You don 't know how nice it is having some intelligent person to talk to .
Good morning .
Fine morning , sir .
Yes , it is a fine morning .
Don 't be in a hurry .
You see , I 'm the old-fashioned type .
And I was also middleweight champion when I was in college .
I thought you might like to know that before this thing starts .
Well , you see , sir , I 'm the new butler .
I just served Miss Irene her breakfast .
Do you always take a change of wardrobe when you serve breakfast ?
I think this young lady can explain .
He really is the new butler , Mr. Bullock .
I can 't imagine how his things got in the hallway . I still don 't get it . But if you are the new butler , why didn 't you say so ?
I 'm very sorry , sir .
May I ? There 's a man at the door to see you .
I think it 's another process server . - Another one ?
- Yes , sir .
Well , here I am again with another little present ...
Yes , I 've heard that before .
Which one of the family is it this time ? Miss Cornelia .
Last night , she busted up a few windows along Fifth Avenue .
- I 'm sorry , but girls will be girls .
- Good-bye .
In this family , it 's one subpoena after another .
Mr. Bullock , there 's a handsome cab driver waiting in the kitchen .
It 's in the library , where Miss Irene left it .
Come here , my man .
Do you like your place here , so far as you 've gone ?
I find it very entertaining .
Yes , we are a very entertaining family .
You really think you 're going to like it here ?
I must admit it 's more desirable than living in a packing case on a city dump . Oh , that 's where I met you , isn 't it ?
- Yes , miss .
- Oh , yes , yes .
I remember now .
We were playing some sort of a game ...
a scavenger hunt , I think .
We needed a forgotten man .
I asked you to go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me , and I 'm a little bit hazy as to just what happened after that .
- I pushed you into an ash pile .
They were nice , clean ashes . - I 'm very sorry , miss .
- I didn 't mind at all . It was very amusing .
Have you a handkerchief ? There 's a spot on my shoe .
Would you see what you can do about it ?
But I like to see things wriggle .
When I get through with you , you 'll go back to your packing case on the city dump and relish it .
People don 't make a practice of pushing Cornelia Bullock into ash piles .
I 'll make your life so miser ...
- Hello , Godfrey .
- Greetings , Irene .
- I like your new monkey suit . - Thank you for picking it up .
- It fits very well for a hand-me-down .
- I 'm more or less standard .
How do you like my new pajamas ?
I think they 're very nice .
Thank you .
- I heard what you said to Godfrey .
- So what ? - So you leave him alone !
- Who 's gonna make me leave him alone ?
If you don 't , you 'll get a good sock from me .
- Oh , the physical type . - What I say goes . Since when did you start falling in love with butlers ?
I 'm not in love with him .
He 's my protege . Oh , your protege . That 's why you 're picking out his suits for him .
Suppose Father hears about this . How long do you think Godfrey will last ? Father isn 't going to hear about it .
If Father hears about Godfrey , he 's also going to hear about you and that college boy .
I don 't know what you 're talking about .
But if Father does hear about it , I 'm likely to do a little socking myself .
Little Red Riding Hood didn 't have enough charm to trap a wolf her own age , so she falls in love with the butler and lives happily ever after .
- If you know what I mean . - I know , if you know what I mean .
- May I come in ?
- You 're in , aren 't you ?
Very interesting book .
The Greeks of the Middle Ages .
Oh , Irene would like that . You love the Middle Ages , don 't you , dear ?
[ Mrs. Bullock Blathering ]
- Ahh . - [ Speaking Italian ]
Oh , Carlo ! Who 's giving the concert tonight ?
- The great Kalininski .
- Oh , the pianist ? - No , cellist .
- What difference does it make ?
Oh , it 's so nice to see you two girls having a pleasant chat .
Or is it a pleasant chat ?
Well , well , well ! Imagine the Bullocks gathered together in one room .
- Don 't forget Carlo . - I 'm not going to forget Carlo .
Don 't bother about me . I feel like one of the family .
Don 't you go away . You don 't mind if I discuss a few family matters , do you , Carlo , old boy ?
- No , not at all .
- Oh , Alexander , you 're not going to bring up those sordid business matters , I hope .
I 've just been going over last month 's bills , and you people have confused me with the Treasury Department .
Don 't start that again , Dad . I don 't mind giving the government 60 % of what I make .
But I can 't do it when my family spends 50 % !
Well , why should the government get more money than your own family ?
That 's what I want to know .
Why should the government get more ?
Well , that 's just the way they have of doing things .
Money , money , money !
The Frankenstein monster that destroys souls ! Please don 't say anything more about it !
You 're upsetting Carlo !
We 've got to come to an understanding right now ! - Either Carlo is or I am . - Am what ?
Well , one of us has got to , and that 's all there is to it .
You 're inebriated . You don 't know what you 're talking about .
Who would know what they 're talking about , living with a bunch like this ?
What this family needs is discipline .
I 've been a pretty patient man .
But when people start riding horses up the front steps ... and parking them in the library , that 's going a bit too far .
- Horses ? - Are you insinuating I rode a horse ?
Maybe that wasn 't a horse I saw in the library .
I 'm positive I didn 't ride a horse . I didn 't have my riding costume on .
- Irene rode the horse up the steps . - What horse ?
Don 't play innocent .
I begged you not to do it . I didn 't ride a horse !
But if I did ride a horse , who broke those windows on Fifth Avenue ?
- What windows ?
- You know what windows !
And how about that college sap ?
Yah , yah , yah !
I don 't care who broke the horse , rode the window or yah , yah , yah 'ed .
- But this family 's got to settle down !
- [ Groans ] Will you stop bellowing !
Look what you 're doing to Carlo . - Hang Carlo !
- [ Angelica ] Ohhh !
- Did you make these ? - I helped . - They must be wonderful .
You might as well face the situation .
I 've lost a lot of money . - You have ?
- Yes , I have .
Maybe you left it in your other suit .
If things keep on , it won 't be long till I don 't have another suit .
Which ones are poisoned ?
Thank you .
While we 're on the subject , how about this business of certain people ... picking up anybody they find on the city dump and dragging them into the house ?
- We might all be stabbed and robbed . - Who 's going to stab who ?
We don 't know a thing about certain people .
Someone should speak to Irene about picking up strays .
- Now , now , children . Come , Carlo . Come and get some nice hors d 'oeuvre .
I think we should get our help from employment agencies .
I don 't know but I agree with Cornelia . [ Angelica ] What are you all talking about ?
[ Sobbing ]
You upset Carlo , and now you 're upsetting Irene .
Don 't you remember her breakdown last summer ?
I certainly do . That 's why I 'm not paying any attention to this .
If Mother can sponsor Carlo , why can 't I sponsor Godfrey ?
Godfrey knows I 'm not being personal , but none of us would like to wake up some morning stabbed to death .
You mustn 't come between Irene and Godfrey .
He 's the first thing she 's shown any affection for since her Pomeranian died .
Now , now , Irene .
You mustn 't have a spell .
Carlo , quick , quick , give me a sofa cushion .
Come , darling , lift up your head like a good girl .
There now , darling , don 't cry .
Now , now , darling .
She 's not having a spell .
That 's old stuff .
- [ Sobbing Continues ]
- Darling . - What is all this nonsense ?
- Will you be quiet !
You never did understand them .
Why don 't you get a doctor ?
- I don 't want a doctor ! - Do you want an ice bag ?
- I want to die !
- You mustn 't do that .
She makes me ill . Let 's get out of here .
Carlo , do the gorilla for Irene .
- Here . - All right .
I 'll do it , but my heart won 't be in it .
Irene , be a good girl and sit up and look at Carlo .
You know it always amuses you .
Look at Carlo ! Isn 't that lovely ?
Oh , isn 't that clever , Irene ? Look !
[ Sobbing Stops ]
- [ Chittering ] - [ Irene Sobbing ]
She can see you better . She 's starting to laugh .
- She 's starting to laugh .
- [ Angelica Laughing ] - [ Carlo Croaks ]
Isn 't that funny ?
Oh , he 's on the door . Look ! Look !
- [ Angelica Laughing ] - He frightens me !
No , darling , you mustn 't be frightened .
He 's just playing . [ Laughing Continues ]
Darling , look at Carlo .
[ Irene Continues Sobbing ]
- Look , darling , look .
Isn 't he clever ? - No !
Why don 't you stop imitating a gorilla and imitate a man ?
You wouldn 't know an artist if one came up and bit you !
This family doesn 't need any stimulant .
I 'll be in my room . You can repeat this order in 30 minutes .
Someday I 'm going gorilla hunting , and I won 't miss .
[ Sobbing Continues ] Has Cornelia gone ?
[ Angelica ] Yes , darling , she 's gone .
- Where 's Godfrey ?
- He 's here . Don 't go away , Godfrey .
Godfrey , come over here so Irene can look at you .
- Where ? Right here . Look .
Say hello to Irene so she 'll know who you are . - Hello .
- I 'm going . Take good care of her . Yes , Carlo , I 'm coming .
Good-bye , darling , good-bye .
[ Whispering ]
I beg your pardon ?
[ Whispering ]
I 'm sorry , but I didn 't quite hear ...
I said , I 'm not really having a spell .
Looks like we 've lost most of our customers .
Well , what 's the matter , handsome ?
What kind of family am I up against ? There are some things even I can 't answer .
Do they go on this way all the time ?
- Oh , no ! This is just a quiet evening .
- Quiet evening ?
If I were you , I 'd get rid of that lip rouge .
Makes you look a little like Cupid .
You 'll find Godfrey in his room .
How did you know I want to see Godfrey ?
I don 't know . It just came over me .
Oh , you ...
you can 't come in here . Why not ?
It 's our house , isn 't it ?
One room is just like any other room .
Besides , I want to talk .
I 'm terribly sorry , but we can 't talk here . Don 't you think it 's indecent of you to order me out after you kissed me ?
After I kissed you , did you say ?
Isn 't it funny ?
This morning you were sitting on my bed ; now I 'm on yours . We 'll overlook that startling coincidence .
- Uh , will you sit over here , please ? - The bed 's comfortable .
- If it isn 't , I 'll get you another . - We 'll have our talk here .
If you want a new bed , you can have it .
Uh , the bed 's very comfortable , thank you . Much more so than I am at the moment . Any time you 're uncomfortable , you just let me know .
Thank you .
Hasn 't anyone ever told you about certain proprieties ?
You use such lovely big words .
I like big words .
What does it mean ? I 'll try to simplify it . Hasn 't your mother or anyone ever explained to you ... that some things are proper and some things are not ?
She rambles on quite a bit , but she never says anything .
- But you want me to remain , don 't you ?
- Oh , of course ! And I want to justify your faith in me by being a very good butler ... and filling the void created by the death of your late , lamented Pomeranian .
Oh , I 've forgotten about him . He had fleas , anyway .
Besides , you 're different .
You use big words , and you 're much cuter .
- May I tell you a story ?
- I 'd love it .
Once there was very sentimental little girl with a very kind heart , and she helped a man who was very grateful .
Then she became a nuisance and undid all the fine work she had done .
I can say good morning and you can say good morning .
- But you must never come into my room .
- You 'll be sorry ! - I 'm only trying to be helpful .
- You 're being mean !
I 'll do something !
You wait and see ! You 'll be sorry ! You 'll be sorry !

# Ochi Chornie #
That 's a very pretty tune . What 's the name of it ?
# Ochi Chornie #
Oh , that 's the name too .
I thought it was just the words .
I like it because the words are all the same .
That 's probably why " The Star Spangled Banner " is so confusing .
Nobody seems to know the words . [ Chuckles ]
Except , perhaps , Godfrey .
He seems to know everything .
- Do you know the words ?
- The words ?
Yes , yes . " The Star Spangled Banner . " Nobody seems to know the words .
Do you know them , Godfrey ?
I suppose I know as many as the average person .
I feel ashamed of myself .
I should know them all . After all , my ancestors came over on the boat .
Not the Mayflower , but the boat after that .
What did your ancestors come over on , Godfrey ?
As far as I know , they 've always been here . They weren 't Indians , I hope .
One can never be sure of one 's ancestors ...
You know , you have rather high cheekbones .
Yes , ma 'am .
Thank you , ma 'am .
These flowers came for Irene .
Where shall I put them ? Well , ask her . There she is now .
Yes , ma 'am .
[ Whispering ] Psst , Carlo .
Did you notice his cheekbones ? These flowers just came for you , miss .
Where shall I put them ?
What difference does it make when one 's heart is breaking ?
Shall I put them on the piano ?
Life is but an empty bubble .
You don 't sound very cheerful for a girl who 's giving a tea party .
Why should anyone be cheerful ?
Oh , is Irene giving a tea party ? - You 're not invited .
- I 'll invite myself .
- Let 's stick around , George . - Sure . Why not ?
All I have to say is , some people will be sorry someday .
- Naturally , everybody will be someday . - For what ?
Some people will know for what , and then it will be too late . This conversation is very confusing . Now , now , Irene .
He 's practicing . [ Giggles ]
Do you know any good funeral music , Carlo ?
Shut up !
Are you acting for anybody in particular ?
Do you suppose Miss Irene would like sandwiches served in here , or shall I create a sort of buffet ?
Where do you want the sandwiches served ?
- What is food ?
- Something you eat , silly .
Do you want the sandwiches served in here , or don 't you ?
What difference does it make ?
Some people do as they like ... with other people 's lives , and it doesn 't make any difference .
[ Cornelia Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
# # [ Humming Folk Tune ]
- What did I call ?
- Five , hearts .
Was it hearts ? I meant spades .
I can 't change , can I ?
That music has me so confused .
Carlo , please !
[ Giggles ] Hi , Irene .
Why the shroud ?
Listen , Van Rumple , just because some people have a million dollars ... doesn 't mean they can put their arms around other people .
Brrr ! Where 's the bar ?
Don 't take her seriously .
The servant problem 's been bothering her lately .
No , thank you .
I 'm not hungry .
# # [ Humming Continues ]
No , thank you .
- Four , clubs . - Oh , just a minute , Godfrey .
Uh , bye . - Hello , everybody !
- Hello , Tommy .
- Hello there .
What 's the matter with you , Godfrey ?
Are you ill ?
Come along , Tommy , and give Angelica a hug . How 's everything in Boston ?
All the beans and things ?
We 're rounding them up and putting them in cans .
- How are you , darling ?
- What does it matter how I am ? - The whole thing is only a delusion .
- What thing ?
- You wouldn 't understand .
- Well , I don 't so far . I 'm famished .
How about something to eat ?
Oh , Godfrey , bring Mr. Gray a sandwich .
It 's your play .
Well , come around here Mr. Gray 's not an acrobat .
What 's come over you ?
You 're beginning to act like the rest of the family .
- Hey , wait a minute !
- What 's the trouble ?
Godfrey Parke , you old mug !
- Oh , do you know Godfrey ? - We went to Harvard together .
I 'm afraid you 've confused me with someone else .
I 'm Smith , remember ?
Sure , you 're Smith . We did go to college together ?
- Or did we ?
- A butler with a college education .
- He 's not really the butler ? - And a very good one .
You mean , this is not a gag just for my benefit ?
Mr. Gray neglected to tell you that when we were in Harvard , I was his valet .
- Was he a good servant , Tommy ?
- Excellent . - What 's the idea ?
- I 'll tell you later .
- Mr. Gray never complained . - When ? No , I had very few complaints about Godfrey 's work .
I 'll tell you tomorrow . It 's my day off . Strange , you never gave Mr. Gray as a reference .
You see , I left Mr. Gray under very unusual circumstances .
- What circumstances ? - I 'd rather Mr. Gray told you .
Well , don 't go away .
Come here and tell us all about it .
Godfrey 's a very mysterious person .
Nobody seems to know about him .
- Don 't go away , Godfrey .
- No , no , don 't go away , Godfrey . You see , I didn 't want to say anything about this .
But , you see , Godfrey had been working for us as a butler and whatnot , and things had been going along very well ... when all of a sudden it happened ... just like that .
You 're sure you want me to tell all this , Godfrey ?
[ Mutters ]
Well , you see , as I said , he 'd been working for us for some time , when one day he came to me and said ,
" Mr. Gray , I trust my work has always been satisfactory . "
I said , " Why , of course .
I 've never had more satisfactory work in all my life . "
And he said , " Thank you , Mr. Gray . "
He was always a very courteous man , Godfrey .
Godfrey is still extremely courteous , especially in the morning .
Well , it 's not much of a story .
Maybe we 'd better skip it . Come on , Tommy , finish it .
You can 't stop in the middle . - Where was I ?
- Telling us how polite Godfrey was .
And that 's where I said that Godfrey was still very polite .
Thank you , Mrs. Bullock .
It 's a pleasure to have you say so publicly . That 's my nature .
I never say anything behind your back I won 't say in public .
That 's what I admire about you , Angelica . That 's nice of you , Tommy .
What about the story ? Well , anyway , Godfrey said , " I trust my work has been satisfactory , sir . "
That was about the gist of it , wasn 't it , Godfrey ?
Those may not have been my exact words , sir , but that was about the gist of it .
We 'll settle for that .
He said thank you , and then what ?
- I had to take an attitude .
- What kind of an attitude ?
Well , the only kind I could take toward a faithful servant .
But Godfrey decided in favor of his wife and five children .
- Five children ?
My , my ! - Five .
Tsk , tsk , tsk .
Was his wife an Indian woman ? She was rather dark . We used to take her on hunting trips to stalk the game .
Godfrey !
Why didn 't you tell me you had five children ?
Why shouldn 't Godfrey have five children ?
If a woman in Canada can have five children , why can 't Godfrey ?
I owe the creation of my family to Mr. Gray 's generosity .
Well , if other people can have five children , so can other people .
Personally , I think two are plenty , and Bullock agrees with me .
[ Giggles ]
Listen , everybody , I want to make an announcement about something .
What do you want to announce ?
- I 'm going to be married .
- Married ? To whom ?
- Well , you 'll find out soon enough .
- Not Charlie Van Rumple ?
- Yes , Charlie Van Rumple .
Where is he ?
- He 's at the bar .
I 've had my arm around her before , but this is the first time I ever felt that chill .
- Congratulations , old boy . - Congratulations about what ?
- Your engagement , you slug .
- What engagement ? Why , you 're engaged to Irene , aren 't you ?
- Am I ? - Don 't be ga-ga ! Come on !
[ Confused Chatter ]
- I hear we 're engaged .
- You said it .
- When did it happen ?
- Just now . - What 's all the excitement ?
- I think she 's got herself engaged .
Oh , has she again ? It must be that nice boy in the brown suit .
Let 's go and congratulate them .
You 're a lucky boy .
Which one is he ? - There he is . You 'll pardon me , I hope .
- You 're Van Rumple , aren 't you ?
- Oh , yes . - Oh , you 'll take good care of her . - I imagine so .
My mind 's a little cloudy .
I don 't even remember proposing .
- You 're always proposing .
- [ Laughter ]
- Which one did you take me up on ?
- All of them .
How do you think Godfrey 'll feel about your engagement ?
- What has Godfrey got to do with it ?
- I wonder .
- You mind your own business .
- All right , let 's have those .
- Come on , everybody .
- Are you going to congratulate Irene ?
- She just got herself engaged .
- I 'd be very happy to .
[ Angelica ] Godfrey , come congratulate Irene .
May I congratulate you , Miss Irene ?
I wish you all the happiness in the world .
[ Sobbing ]
[ Angelica ] Just leave her alone .
She 'll be all right in a minute .
- Is she mad at me ? - She 's not mad at anybody .
Women always cry at their own engagements and other people 's weddings .
- Alexander , you missed the excitement . - What 's going on ?
I knew what I wanted to say , but somehow it slipped my mind .
- What 's the matter with Irene ?
- Oh , yes , that 's it ! - Irene 's got engaged .
- To whom ? Van something or other . I think he 's that boy with his arm around that girl .
- He 'll need it . Godfrey , let 's you and I have a good cry .
How about lunch by my hotel tomorrow ?
Do you prefer soda or ginger ale ? - Both . 12 : 00 ?
- Very good , sir .
Make up your mind just who she 's going to marry .
I 'd like to meet the guy . [ Angelica ] I don 't know , Alexander .
It 's one of those boys in there .
Come along , now . [ Sobbing Continues ]
You 're not eating well this morning , sir .
- You notice everything .
- Business trouble , sir ?
What made you ask that ?
Well , sir , butlers can 't help picking up scraps of news , shall we say ? We shan 't say anything about it .
I thought I might be of some help , sir . I dabbled in the market at one time .
- Very good , sir . Your eggs .
- No , thank you .
Godfrey , you seem to be a pretty good sort .
Have you noticed anything queer about me lately ?
Nothing particularly , sir .
I sometimes wonder whether my whole family 's gone mad or whether it 's me .
I 've felt that way many times since I 've been here .
Then why do you stay here ?
I have to ; you don 't .
It 's much more comfortable than living in a packing box on the city dump , sir .
Besides , I 'm rather proud of my job here .
- You 're proud of being a butler ? - Proud of being a good butler .
And I may add , sir , a butler has to be good to hold his job here .
Say ... who are you ?
I 'm just a nobody , sir . Coffee ?
Godfrey , here I am .
So you 've turned up at last , eh ?
I began to think you had fallen down the kitchen sink . Sorry I 'm late , Tommy . It 's hard to make beds full of people .
You seem to do everything except put out the cat .
I suppose I 'd do that too , only we have no cat .
The same for me . What will you have , Jarvis , my man ?
Make it a rousing old lemonade . Lemonade ?
You sure you can handle it ?
Oh , yes , I 'm the type who can take it or leave it alone .
You see , now that I 'm a working man , I have to keep my wits about me .
I 'm beginning to wonder if you 've got any left . Don 't avoid the issue .
I 've been sitting here like a snoopy old maid ... with her ears flapping in the breeze , waiting to hear the dirt .
What dirt would you like to hear ?
Well , when I see one of the Parkes of Boston serving hors d 'oeuvre ...
I think I 'm entitled to a pardonable curiosity . Why tell you something that you won 't understand ?
You 've fallen off so many polo ponies that your brain is scrambled .
But I still want to know why you 're buttling , when your family is telling everybody that you 're in South America .
A family has to say something to save its face . The Parkes disgrace very easily .
I 'd like to see their faces when they find out that you 're a butler .
- They 're not going to find it out .
- Come to the point .
Well , there isn 't much of a point .
Do you remember that little incident up in Boston ?
You still have that woman on your mind ?
No , not anymore .
But I was pretty bitter at the time . So I gave her everything I had and just disappeared .
You know , the Parkes were never educated to face life .
- We 've been puppets for ten generations . - And ?
Tommy , it 's surprising how fast you can go downhill ... when you begin to feel sorry for yourself .
And boy did I feel sorry for myself !
I wandered down to the East River one night , thinking I 'd just slide in and get it over with .
But I met some fellows living there , on a city dump .
They were people who were fighting it out and not complaining .
I never got as far as the river .
Go around the corner and telephone this place and ask for Tommy Gray .
When you get him on the wire , keep him there .
- What 's this all about ? - Don 't ask too many questions .
Okay .
And so out of the ruins of Godfrey Parke ... a new edifice has sprung up in the form of Godfrey Smith .
And , I may add , the edifice is going to keep on springing .
Do you intend to remain a butler ? No , I have some other ideas in mind .
But you wouldn 't understand those either , so we won 't go into that .
- Will you do me a favor ? - Maybe .
I have a friend in town , a very eminent brain specialist .
I 'd like him to examine you .
I 'll submit to an examination , if you will also .
- That 's a bet .
- [ Laughs ] - Are you Mr. Gray ?
- Yes . - You 're wanted on the phone . - On the phone ?
Back in a minute , Godfrey .
- Well , the mystery 's solved .
- The mystery ? Yes .
Now I know what a butler does on his day off .
When you worked for Mr. Gray , were the two of you always this chummy ?
You see , I worked for Mr. Gray a long time , and we got to be ...
Yeah , that was under the name of Smith , wasn 't it ? Or did I hear him mention the name of Parke ? He may have said that we used to take long walks in the park .
- A sort of custom . - Oh , yes , I see .
Well , if you can be so chummy with the Grays , why can 't you be chummy with the Bullocks ?
- I try to keep my place .
- Why ?
You 're very attractive .
- As a butler ?
- No , as a Smith .
- You 're a rotten butler .
- Sorry .
Are we going to be friends ?
I feel that on my day off , I should have the privilege of choosing my friends .
You can 't go on like this forever .
You really like me , and you 're afraid to admit it , aren 't you ?
- Very well .
You belong to that unfortunate category ... that I would call the Park Avenue brat .
A spoiled child who 's grown up in ease and luxury , who 's always had her own way , and whose misdirected energies are so childish ... that they hardly deserve the comment even of a butler on his offThursday .
Thank you for a very lovely portrait .
Hiya , Cornelia .
What are you doing here ?
Godfrey and I were discussing tomorrow 's menu .
- Well , don 't run away .
- I 'm in an awfully big hurry .
Good-bye . I 'll see you down by the ash pile .
- What did she mean by that ? - A little joke we have between us .
Oh , I see .
Ajoking butler . What 's the matter with that stuff ?
I think I 'll switch .
I 'm more at mood . Now we 're getting someplace .
Waiter ! Another one of these .
Would you mind putting these flowers in his room ? - I can 't go in there anymore .
- I can 't , either .
It 's his , isn 't it ?
- Do you always sew his buttons on ? - Sometimes .
- He doesn 't lose very many . - Oh , he 's very tidy ... - Yes , he 's very tidy .
He 's probably sitting somewhere with some woman on his lap . He 's the meanest man I know .
I think he 's very mean .
I suppose he 's sitting somewhere with somebody on his lap ... who doesn 't care for him at all .
As far as I know , maybe his children are there too , calling him , calling him .
[ Sobbing ] Oh , I can 't bear it .
Please don 't .
[ Sobbing ]
You too ?
Oh , Molly , I know exactly how you feel . [ Sobbing Continues ]
" And the afternoon came into a land ... into which it seemed always afternoon . "
You know , sometimes I wonder if my children are all there .
" Like a downward smoke , the slender stream along the cliff ... did fall and fall and fall to the sea . "
# # [ Whistling Continues ]
Evening .
# # [ Whistling ]
I beg your pardon . I thought you were Miss Cornelia .
You thought I was Cornelia ?
Forgive me , but you seem to be looking younger every day , if I may say so .
[ Giggles ]
# # [ Godfrey Whistling ]
I don 't mind dying , if other people don 't . She 's in love .
Haven 't you heard ? It 's probably her engagement .
Several of my girlfriends acted just like that .
[ Dishes Shattering ]
There goes the profits .
I beg your pardon .
I don 't know what 's the matter with Godfrey .
He 's been acting so peculiar .
But he did pay me a nice compliment .
He 's always paying other people compliments .
Why don 't you eat ? Look at Carlo . He 's had two helpings of everything .
Leave her alone .
Carlo 's eating enough for both of them .
He ought to be strong enough soon to give that concert .
You can 't rush genius .
He could give a bang-up concert right now with a knife and fork .
Why not try someone else for a change ? Wait a minute , Mother .
Come here , Dad .
Something terrible has happened .
What is it ? What 's happened ?
You look frightened .
You 're as white as a sheet .
Let 's go into the living room , where we won 't be overheard .
Cornelia , what is it ?
Are you ill ? Come , come , sit down here .
Let me get you an aspirin or something . - I 'm all right .
- What 's troubling you ?
Do you remember the pearl necklace I got for my birthday ? - Why , yes ! - What about it ?
- It 's disappeared . - Maybe somebody stole it .
Will you fill your gob and keep out of this !
- We don 't need your help .
- When did you find out ?
- I put it on my dressing table .
I went upstairs just now , and it was gone .
- And it cost such a lot of money .
- I 'll say it did . - What are we going to do ? - I 'll go call the police .
Never mind , Dad .
I 've already called them .
Oh !
Mm-mm .
Well , what I want to know is , when did you miss the pearls ?
During dinner I went to my room , and they were gone .
- She 's always leaving them .
- Nobody asked you anything .
If you 're going to be rude to my daughter , you might take your hats off .
When we 're on criminal cases , lady , we keep both hands free .
You mean to imply that I 'm a criminal ?
All I know is that it 's an inside job .
- Who 's that ?
- It 's Mother 's protege .
No wise cracks .
Is that your son ?
Say , listen , I 've made a lot of mistakes in my life , but I 'll be hanged if I 'll plead guilty to that .
[ Angelica ] Stop picking on Carlo !
He wouldn 't have time to steal anything .
He 's too busy eating .
- Who are you ? - Guess . - Where is Godfrey ?
- He isn 't feeling very well . - Who are you staring at ?
- Just a minute , sister .
If I thought that were true , I 'd disown my parents .
[ Chuckles ] So you got a passion for jewelry , huh ?
Yes , and I got a passion for socking cops .
- Where are they ?
- Most of them are in cemeteries .
- Where is the necklace ? - Maybe I swallowed it . You mustn 't accuse Molly .
She 's been with us a long time .
- That in itself is some recommendation . - Thank you , Molly .
You 're welcome .
I 'll turn down the beds .
- Who is this Godfrey ?
- He 's the best butler we ever had .
Oh , I 'm sure Godfrey didn 't take them , though we don 't know much about him .
Godfrey wouldn 't touch those old pearls with a fork . Just a minute .
What do you mean you don 't know much about him ?
We didn 't get him from an employment agency .
- My sister found him on a city dump .
- Oh , I see .
- Are you accusing Godfrey ?
- I only want my necklace .
It 's so silly to think of Godfrey wearing a pearl necklace .
- Where is this butler ?
- He 's probably in his room .
- Where is that ?
- It 's back this way .
[ Screams ]
That 's his room over there .
Godfrey , if you 've got ' em , hide ' em !
- Hey , what kind of a joint is this ?
- All right , lady . [ Irene Shouts , Indistinct ]
Hello , men .
- Where are they ? - Where ?
That 's what I said . Where ?
# Where oh where has my little dog gone #
Come on , snap out of it !
- You notice he 's been drinking .
I don 't blame him if he has . This family 's probably got to him too .
Do you mind if we search your room , Godfrey ?
Somebody lost ?
- Do you know anything about it ? - Well , let 's look for it .
- That 's too bad .
- It 's too bad for you .
I wouldn 't be so cocksure of everything .
This is a serious matter . The pearls couldn 't just get up and walk away .
She probably threw them out of the taxi .
Let 's look under the rug .
Maybe that 's where I put it .
We 'll do the searching , Godfrey , old boy .
- It 's a pleasure . - This is all very silly .
I can imagine a woman stealing pearls , but what would Godfrey do with them ?
- Look under the mattress .
- Yes , there 's a dandy place .
[ Officer ] Well , they 're not here .
They must be there .
Just a minute . What makes you so sure they oughta be under the mattress ?
I read that that 's where people put things when they steal them .
- Say , what are you up to ?
I 'd like to talk to you boys outside for just a minute , if you don 't mind .
- I 'm terribly sorry , Godfrey . - [ Irene ] I told you so .
[ Angelica ] We 're all terribly sorry , Godfrey .
Come , Cornelia .
Yah , yah , yah , yah !
[ Door Closes ] I wanna apologize for my family .
- We got an idea what you 're up against . - I 'd like to let the matter drop .
She probably mislaid her necklace .
I 'm not certain she had one . There 's something phony about the whole thing .
- The whole thing 's forgotten . - Good night , boys .
[ Door Closes ]
Just what have you got to say for yourself ?
Aren 't they going to do anything about it ?
No , and it 's a good thing for you that they 're not .
If you don 't find your necklace , the joke 's on you ... because it 's not insured .
And something else .
[ Taunting ] Cornelia lost her pearls , and I 've got mine !
Cornelia lost her pearls , and I 've got mine !
[ Laughing ]
Well , here we are , Tommy .
The village of forgotten men .
- How do you like it ?
Do you mean to say that people really live in this place ?
Well , they go through the motions .
Tommy , observe yon structure on your left .
That was the birthplace of the celebrated butler Godfrey Smith .
- Where are the ashes of Godfrey Parke ?
- Scattered to the winds .
- Hello , Duke . Well , well . - Hiya , Mike .
- How 's tricks ? - Meet Mr. Gray . Mr. Flaherty .
Mr. Gray , pardon my wet paw .
I 've been washing my lingerie . - That 's okay .
- Hey , Bob , look who 's here .
- [ Godfrey ] Hi , Bob .
- Well , bust my false teeth ! Say , thanks for the beans .
They got here just in time . What 's up ?
The beans was marvelous .
We ate everything but the can .
Don 't thank me .
Thank Mr. Gray .
He 's got a corner on the bean market .
Is that the same corner that prosperity 's just around ?
No , that 's another one .
Hello , Arthur .
- Hello , Duke .
- Meet Mr. Gray . Mr. Bellinger .
You look as though you 've got a job too . Is this an epidemic ?
[ Man ] Hey , Mike .
Let 's get goin ' .
Duke , we gotta run along .
This is moving day .
We gotta help the boys move their shacks .
The trucks are crowding in .
We oughta be in the river by early spring .
We might be able to float by that time .
See you again .
Right .
That fellow with the bundle of wood is Bellinger of the Second National .
When his bank failed , he gave up everything so his depositors wouldn 't suffer .
- Not really ?
- Really . There are two kinds of people :
Those who fight the idea ... of being pushed into the river and the other kind .
After all , things have always been this way for some people .
These men are not your responsibility .
There are different ways of having fun . You have a peculiar sense of humor .
Here we have some very fashionable apartment houses , over there is a very swanky nightclub ... while down here men starve for want of a job .
- How does that strike you ? - What 's this leading to ?
Tommy , there 's a very peculiar mental process called thinking .
You wouldn 't know much about that .
But when I was living here , I did a lot of it .
One thing I discovered was that the only difference between a derelict and a man is a job .
Sit down over here and rest your weary bones . Let me tell you what I want .
Well , I 'll listen , but I still think you belong in a psychopathic ward .
You may be right , but let me tell you my plan , and listen with both ears .
I have an idea ...
Did you and Irene have a good time while you were in Europe ?
Oh , as good a time as anyone could have with Irene . - You should be more civil to Carlo .
- Why ? - I don 't mind . Cherchez la femme .
- You had plenty . - I can 't say anything ! - You never do .
- Oh , what 's come over you ?
We spend good money to send you abroad , and you 're worse off than when you left .
- Her liver is probably upset . - Take a liver pill .
- I don 't want a liver pill . - You mustn 't get upset .
You 've broken many before and never acted this way .
She 's upset because Godfrey didn 't fall down in a faint when we got in today .
Why should Godfrey fall in a faint ?
He didn 't make enough fuss over her homecoming to suit her .
Well , Godfrey 's not the fussing kind .
Shh .
Godfrey , I was just telling my daughters you missed them while they were away .
Oh , yes , I did . Very much , indeed . - We missed you too , didn 't we , Irene ?
- I missed you , also . - It 's nice to miss everybody .
Then it makes it so nice when we get together again .
There , there , darling .
It 's nice to see you cheerful . - You do have a way with you , Godfrey . - Thank you .
There 's no use denying the fact that Godfrey has a way with him .
We must be running on .
Cornelia , cheer her up .
I 'm a cinch .
Do you feel better now that you know Godfrey missed us ?
He missed me more .
I could tell by the light in his eyes .
Why don 't throw yourself in the man 's arms ?
You can 't rush a man like Godfrey .
You 're getting pretty old , you know ?
He 's really in love .
He 's just hard to break down .
I could break him down in no time at all .
- He 'd have nothing to do with you . - How do you know ?
Because he wouldn 't . Don 't you try anything .
I 'm not saying I will , and I 'm not saying I won 't
Come to think of it , Godfrey and I have a little unfinished business .
You better leave it unfinished , unless you want to be wearing a lamp for a hat .
[ Laughing ]
Did you mean it when you said you missed me ? Oh !
I 'm glad , because if you missed Cornelia more , you 'd probably miss me less .
- That sounds very logical .
- That 's all I wanted to know . - You look so cute in your apron .
- I 'm not trying to look cute .
Molly has a cold , and I 'm doubling for her .
- What 's funny about that ? - She hasn 't got a cold . - No ?
She 's got the same thing I 've got , only you won 't let me talk about that .
- You 'll lose your temper .
- [ Chuckles ] Well , not seriously . - Will you let me do something ?
- What do you want to do ? - Wipe .
- Oh , all right .
- You can tell me all about your trip .
- You won 't get mad ? - Why should I ?
- Because everybody was Godfrey .
Every ...
I don 't want to seem dull , but I do seem to have a little trouble following you at times .
Well , for instance , when I 'd go into a restaurant in Paris ,
I 'd close my eyes and say , " The waiter is Godfrey .
I 'm home , and he 's serving me dinner . "
- It made everything taste better . - Why ? - Haven 't you any sense ?
- I 'm afraid I haven 't . When I 'd get in a cab , the driver was Godfrey , and I 'd say , " This is his chariot , and he 's taking me to his castle on the mountains . "
Suppose you come down out of the mountains and tell me about your trip .
We went to Venice , and I went for a ride in one of those rowboats .
Not a matador . That was in Spain . But something like a matador .
Do you , by any chance , mean a gondolier ? That was the name of the boat . The man that pushed it sang a beautiful song .
- It was beautiful . - I see .
- So the man was Godfrey . - I didn 't even mind the smell .
It was very convenient to take a trip abroad without leaving the kitchen .
Oh , you have a wonderful sense of humor . I wish I had a sense of humor .
But I never can think of the right thing to say .
Do you mind if I talk for a little bit , while you catch your breath ?
I 'd love it .
While you 've been away , I 've been doing some things also .
I 've been trying to do things that I thought would make you proud of me .
Oh , I was proud of you before I went away . Yes , but I mean prouder still .
You see , you helped me to find myself , and I 'm very grateful .
- You 'd make a wonderful husband . - [ Chuckles ]
I 'm afraid not .
- I know how you feel about things . - How ?
Well , you 're grateful to me because I helped you to beat Cornelia , and I 'm grateful to you because you helped me to beat life .
But that doesn 't mean that we have to fall in love .
If you don 't want to , but I 'd make a wonderful wife . Well , not for me , I 'm afraid .
You see , I like you very much .
But I had a very bitter experience .
But I won 't bore you with that .
- Maybe she wasn 't in love with you . - Well , maybe not .
However , that 's beside the point .
You and I are friends . I feel a certain responsibility to you .
- That 's why I wanted to tell you first .
- Tell me what ?
Well , I thought it was about time that I was moving on .
Godfrey !
Now , please .
- I won 't cry , I promise .
- That 's fine . After all , I 'm your protege .
- You want me to improve myself ?
- Yes . You don 't want me to go on being just a butler all my life , do you ?
- I want you to be anything you want .
- Well , that 's very sweet .
- When are you leaving ?
- Oh , pretty soon .
But I 'll call you up every now and then .
We 'll have long chats .
I 'll tell you how I 'm getting on .
- Oh , we 'll have lots of fun .
- Are you going back to her ?
- To whom ? - That Indian woman .
Indian ...
Oh !
[ Laughs ]
She was just a fabrication .
Oh ! Then , you weren 't married to her ?
No , she was just a product ofTommy Gray 's imagination .
- Then there wasn 't any ? - No ! Well , there couldn 't have been five children .
- Well , naturally . - [ Laughing ]
That makes a difference .
Yeah , that makes a difference .
Did you ring , miss ?
You needn 't be so formal when we 're alone .
Shouldn 't that rather increase a butler 's formality ? - But you 're not a butler .
- I 'm sorry if I 've disappointed . You might drop that superior attitude for a moment .
There 's a little matter I 've wanted to talk over with you for quite a while ... called " The Mystery of Milady 's Necklace " ... or " What Happened to the Pearls ? "
Pearls ? Necklace ? Oh , you mean the one that disappeared last fall ?
- The same .
- Didn 't that ever turn up ?
Oh , yes , it turned up , but not in my possession .
I know the first part of the story , but I wondered what you know might know ?
- I can 't imagine .
- One other story might interest you .
I met some people on the boat coming over . A Boston family , quite distinguished .
They knew a great deal about a family called ... the Parkes .
The old Mayflower crowd . Very upper crust too .
Never been a breath of scandal .
It would be an awful shame to see them made the laughing stock of Boston .
I should hate to see anyone made a laughing stock .
Let 's you and I take a long taxi ride out Van Cortland Way .
Perhaps we could exchange secrets .
- Is that a command ? - As you like .
I 'll be waiting around the corner .
Which corner ?
This one or that one ?
This corner .
It 's impossible to exchange intimate secrets here .
The traffic 's almost as heavy as it is at Grand Central Station .
Don 't forget , darling .
Fifteen minutes .
[ Sobbing ] Please , Godfrey , you can 't go with Cornelia .
But I didn 't say I was going anyplace with Miss Cornelia . I know , but you will .
She always makes everybody do just as she likes .
But why should you care whether I meet her or not ? I do care , that 's why .
Cornelia 's the one who doesn 't care .
I think I should decide those things for myself .
Oh , Godfrey , I don 't want to be annoying , but I ...
Oh ! Oh , see here ...
You-You can 't do that .
Uh , please , snap out of it .
Ohhh , this is the craziest family .
If you 're faking one of your spells to keep me from meeting Cornelia , you 're on the wrong track , you hear ?
- Do you hear ? - Mmm .
No ?
Just a minute .
Godfrey knows how to take care of little Irene .
Yes , indeed .
Just lie there quietly , and Godfrey will take care of everything .
Godfrey knows just how to take care ... of these nasty old faints . That 's the girl .
Come right up here .
There you are .
Godfrey will soon fix Irene . Yes , indeed .
Just leave everything to Godfrey .
Godfrey will take care of everything .
Now , you just sit right down there like a good girl , and in just a minute you 'll forget that you had any trouble .
- I thought so . Let that be a lesson .
Godrey !
Oh , Godfrey , don 't go away !
Oh , Godfrey , now I know you love me .
- I do not love you ! - You do !
What is the meaning of this , may I ask ?
- Godfrey loves me ! - What are you talking about ?
- Godfrey loves me !
- Godfrey , I demand an explanation !
- I think perhaps I had better resign .
- Yes , that 's a good idea .
- What do you think your father 'd say ? - I don 't care .
Godfrey loves me .
You put on some dry clothes and come downstairs .
- Godfrey loves me !
- I never heard anything like this !
Shut that thing off !
I feel gloomy enough as it is !
- Something terrible has happened .
- What ? - Godfrey pushed Irene into a shower .
- What 's terrible about that ?
He 's in love with her .
I can 't make head nor tail out of the whole thing .
I can 't make head nor tail out of what you 're saying .
The only thing is to send him back where he came from .
Imagine , falling in love with a butler .
If you 're going to feel sorry for anyone , feel sorry for Godfrey .
- Alexander !
- Don 't " Alexander " me !
I 've got something more important to talk about .
Don 't tell me you 're going to talk about money matters .
- Money , money , money !
- Yes , I am . But before I start , I 'm going to have a little talk with Carlo .
- What are you going to do ?
- This is private , just for Carlo 's ears .
You don 't mind if we have a little chat , Carlo , old boy ?
You know , for some time , Carlo , I 've felt ...
- What did you say to Carlo ?
- I said good-bye . - Did he go ?
- He left through the side window .
- Where is he going ? - I don 't know , but he won 't be back .
- Now , sit down and do some listening .
- I 've never seen you like this .
Sit down ! What 's come over you ?
- You 're just in time to listen .
- Do you want Godfrey to listen ? Yes , I want Godfrey to listen .
This concerns him too .
You might as well all know , point-blank , we 're about broke .
You mean we haven 't any money left ?
We 've got this house , a few odds and ends , and that 's about all .
Not only that , I 've lost all of my stock in Bullock Enterprises .
I 've borrowed some of the stockholder 's money trying to recoup my losses .
I don 't know where I 'm going to end up .
Maybe in jail . - Alexander !
- But if I do end up in jail , it 'll be the first peace I 've had in 20 years .
And I don 't want any of you to chortle about Godfrey .
You may all end up on the dump .
- [ Cornelia ] What are we going to do ? - May I intrude , sir ?
I 'm afraid things are not as bad as you make out .
- What do you know about it ? - Well , sir ,
I 've known for a long time the Bullock interests were in rather a bad way .
I offered to help you once , but you declined that help .
So I took the liberty of dabbling in the market on my own account .
Here , sir . - What 's this ? - That 's most of your stock .
I knew it had been dumped on the market , so I sold short .
I don 't understand . You sold short . You mean gentlemen 's underwear ?
Wait ! You mean that you 've been making money while I was losing it ?
I did it in your interest , sir . The stock has been endorsed over to you .
I don 't understand .
You did this for me ? Well , sir , there comes a turning point in every man 's life .
A time when he needs help .
It happened to me , also .
This family helped me I hope I repaid my debt .
Some of the money went into a project of my own .
I hope you won 't mind .
Do you mean that you did all that on $ 150 a month ? Well , hardly . You see , with the aid ofTommy Gray ,
I was able to transmute a certain trinket into gold , then into stock and then back into pearls again .
Thank you , dear lady , for the use of this trinket . Oh , Godfrey !
Then you did steal them ! Well , I , uh ...
Perhaps Miss Cornelia had better explain that .
- What is this all about , anyway ?
I put the pearls under Godfrey 's mattress .
Thank you , Miss Cornelia .
I wanted you to say that .
- But why ?
- You wouldn 't understand . Here , Godfrey .
These are rightfully yours . Oh , no , thank you .
I repaid my debt , and I 'm grateful to all of you .
If anyone 's indebted , we are , after the way some of us have treated you .
I 've been repaid in many ways .
I learned patience from Mr. Bullock . I found Mrs. Bullock at all times , shall we say , amusing .
That 's complimentary , and don 't forget you said I looked as young as Cornelia .
- What good did you find in me , if any ?
- A great deal .
You taught me the fallacy of false pride . You taught me humility .
I don 't understand you .
Miss Cornelia , there have been other spoiled children in the world .
I happened to be one of them myself .
You 're a high-spirited girl .
I can only hope that you use those high spirits in a more constructive way .
[ Sobbing ]
You know , I hate to see Godfrey go . He 's the only butler we ever had who understood women .
Well , Molly , you told me to leave my hat near the door .
Remember ? I hate to see you leave , Godfrey .
- Oh , Molly , you 've been swell .
- The house will seem empty . Well , I guess the best friends have to part .
Will you say good-bye to Miss Irene for me ?
I don 't think I can go through that ordeal right now .
[ Sobbing ]
What is it ?
What 's the matter with Cornelia ?
[ Sighs ]
What 's the matter with everybody ?
Mother , what 's the trouble ? - He 's gone .
- Who 's gone ?
- Godfrey .
- Where ? And Carlo 's gone out of the window .
Everybody 's gone !
Oh , Molly , has he gone ? Poor Molly .
Order the car , Molly .
I 'll be right down .
# # [ Big Band ]
- Hello , Duke . - Hi , Mike .
I 'll have one of the boys bring these down , Duke .
- Hello , Duke .
- Hello .
We can 't complain about this .
Complain ?
Why , we got the Meriwethers here !
- So I heard . - Big stuff , huh ?
This is all Greek to me . Oh , here 's our wandering butler now . Explain it to him .
- Arthur . I 've got an estimate from the contractor on your housing plan for the winter .
He figures he can petition off our present buildings into compartments , take care of at least 50 people .
It 'll cost $ 5,800, but that includes steam heat .
Forgotten men with steam . Sounds like something that ought to be on the menu .
I 'll talk with you about it later , Arthur .
I 've still got an interest in this company .
When do you pay dividends ?
We 're giving food and shelter to 50 in the winter and employment in summer .
- What more do you want ?
- You 're the most arbitrary butler ever . - Ex-butler . - Fired ?
I quit .
I felt that foolish feeling coming on again .
- You mean Irene ?
- What do you know about that ?
Nobody knows anything about her love , except all of Upper New York .
Guess I got out just in time .
Why don 't you marry the girl ?
- I 've had enough of matrimony . - What 's wrong with butlers ?
Lots of society girls run away with their chauffeurs .
Never mind about that .
Well , how about an airplane landing ? We 'll come to that later .
Say , mister , what happened to the city dump that was here ?
Well , this is it , but most of it 's been filled in .
- What happened to those forgotten men ?
- Forgotten men ?
- Oh , we got most of them out in time .
- Where 's Godfrey ?
Well , lady , his office is right over there where it says " office . "
Oh , just where it used to be .
Thank you .
Come on , Clarence .
Say , wait a minute !
What is this ? A basket party ?
- Good evening , Mr. Courtney . - Good evening .
- Lovely evening .
- Yes .
Good evening .
Well , there you are .
Business is fine .
I 'm stuck , you 're nuts , and I 'm going back to Boston before I disgrace my family .
- Good riddance .
- Oh , Godfrey , company has come .
- [ Irene ] Hello . - What are you doing here ?
Yes , what are you doing here ? Don 't let him off the hook .
You must leave at once .
Do you hear me ? We got rid of her .
If I can help you in any other way , let me know .
Oh , my , how you 've fixed this place up , Godfrey .
- It 's much nicer than before .
- Oh , you noticed that ?
- Are the forgotten men having a party ?
- It 's their annual reunion .
- I saw the mayor . Is he one too ?
- He 's the guest of honor .
- [ Boat 's Whistle Blowing ]
- Oh , it 's a lovely view . - The bridge is always there ?
- Most always .
Oh , you have a kitchen !
I 'm gonna like this place .
What 's over here ?
Oh , is this where you sleep ?
That 's the general purpose of the room .
Any observations ?
I think it 's very cute , but we 'll have to change the wallpaper .
- What do you mean " we " ? - Oh , I don 't like green wallpaper .
You won 't have to look at it .
You 're going home right now . - Oh , but I can 't go home .
- Why not ? - I can 't go home after what happened .
- What happened ?
You know what happened just as well as I do .
- Now see here ...
- Oh , go on and lose your temper .
I love it when you lose your temper .
Why can 't you let me alone ?
Because you 're my responsibility , and someone has to take care of you . - I can take care of myself .
- Look me in the eye and say that .
You love me , and you know it .
There 's no sense in struggling against a thing when it 's got you .
- That 's all there is to it . - [ Knocking At Door ]
Oh , that 's Clarence .
I 'm sorry I was delayed , Miss Irene .
- I had to go around the back way .
- Put the wood over there .
You can put the groceries right there in the kitchen .
Thank you , Clarence . - What 's the idea ?
I brought some wood and food .
It should last us for a week . It 's a wonder you didn 't bring a minister and license .
- I never thought of that .
- [ Knocking At Door ]
- May I come in ?
- Oh , Mr. Courtney .
Mr. Gray said there were a couple of people here who wanted to get married .
- Are you it ? - Can you marry us without a license ?
It may get me into a lot of trouble , but I guess I 've known your family long enough .
- Who are you going to marry ?
- Godfrey . This is Godfrey . - Oh .
How do you do , Godfrey ? - [ Stammering ]
Does your father know about this ? Everybody knows about it except Godfrey .
Well , I guess we better have a witness .
- Clarence , stand right down here .
- What ? That 's fine .
Right there . Come on , Godfrey . Right there .

The towel 's damp , you haIf-wit .
please grant me wealth and health .
It 's bitter .
Be more careful .
What 's wrong with Sumiko ?
Madam has a headache and is resting .
She 's always out at night .
What time did she get in ?
- Around 2 : 00 a.m. - 2 : 00 ?
close that . It 's cold .
There 's no seaweed .
And no eggs either .
Your hands are filthy !
Go wash them .
Your hands too .
Leave the room .
Look down when you walk , and watch your step .
hello .
What 's wrong ?
Too much rich food again ?
What a klutz .
You 'II never get a good husband like that .
Over here .
hello .
How are things ?
How 's my wife ?
It 's nothing serious .
There 's no fun in my Iife .
What 's this ?
Weren 't you ill ?
Where are you going ?
The Women 's Association .
You 're spending a Iot of time there .
Weren 't you there yesterday ?
And tell me : Do their meetings run until 2 : 00 in the morning ?
I 'm an officer .
I have a Iot of responsibilities .
Can 't you stay home sometimes like a wife should ?
I 'm telling you , she 's hardly ever here .
I envy you .
What are you talking about ?
My wife 's no different .
I doubt that , Doctor .
I 've seen how you dote on her .
Even if I act like a good wife , my husband pays no attention .
When have you ever acted like a good wife ?
When a couple gets like this , it 's the end , isn 't it ?
Don 't talk like that .
" darling ... "
" Yes , dear ? "
Those were happy times .
How I wish I couId be young again .
shall we go back to calling each other " darling " ?
Don 't be absurd .
With a face like yours ?
Then why not find yourself a young mistress ?
And listen to your jealous outbursts ?
What conceit !
You think I 'd be jealous ?
You just don 't have the guts .
You married into my family .
See how she harps on that ?
well , did you or didn 't you ?
Oh , I forgot .
I got these theater tickets from the association .
I 'II have Mr. Nishimura take me .
I 'm sure you won 't mind .
Good morning .
Good morning .
- Thanks again for yesterday .
- Don 't mention it .
This is for you .
hello ?
Yes .
Asai pharmaceuticals .
Just a moment , please .
Susumu , what did she just give you ? tell me .
It 's just ...
Spit it out .
There 's no need to worry .
actually , I think there is a need to worry .
That 's most kind of you .
I 'II call on you later and explain .
Good-bye .
Thank you .
Just a minute .
You old rascal .
Don 't try to seduce that innocent girl .
How was the morning market ? - Just so-so .
That girl 's a real beauty .
Isn 't she ?
Why are you grinning ?
Is something going on ?
- Don 't be absurd !
- I 'm not so sure .
What ever happened with New Azuma ?
- Changing the subject ?
- Not at all .
124 yen , 26 sen .
89 yen , 39 sen ...
Asai pharmaceuticals .
4,500 YEN .
SIGNED : SONOSUKE ASAI
Here 's the money .
Thank you .
I 'II be leaving now .
Thanks for doing this .
- Listen .
- Yes , sir ?
That proposition I made the other day - have you given it any thought ?
I 'II give you all the money you need .
No need to get so tense .
I 've found you a great apartment .
I 'm really , really lonely .
You mustn 't mock me like this .
This isn 't a joke . I 'm telling you the truth .
I have an idea .
Let 's have dinner tonight .
What do you say ?
Be here by 7 : 00 .
I 'II be waiting .
I don 't know .
I have to talk to you .
Wait for me at Koraibashi Station .
Is there no other way ?
I 've asked all around .
It 's no use .
Don 't say that .
You 're the only one I can depend on .
Why not ask the boss ?
If I couId , I wouldn 't be asking you .
He 'd never lend me 300 yen . Not without good reason .
He invited me to some strange place for dinner .
Then go .
- You really mean that ?
- Are you angry ?
Of course .
You 'd want me to do a thing like that ?
- I was joking .
- I 'm not so sure .
I misjudged you .
- I was joking .
- Forget it .
If I can 't get that money , Father will go to jail .
I was hoping you 'd offer to skim some company money .
Then I 'd be the one going to jail .
I 'm not saying you should , just that you should be willing .
I 'd Iike to help , but I just can 't .
Forget it .
You don 't care for me at all .
Enjoy the theater with the boss 's wife .
Don 't be like that .
Sister , where have you been ?
Why didn 't you come home earlier ?
Those men are here again .
welcome .
welcome nothing !
I was just asking your sister whether your father plans to ever repay the money he owes .
No , it 's not that .
He 's still trying to raise the money . - We can 't wait .
- ls that your father ?
- l don 't think so .
The company 's very angry about this .
They 're ready to sue .
What your father did was clearly embezzlement .
He could be arrested .
We worked with your father for a Iong time .
We can 't just watch him get arrested , so we 've made excuses for him until now .
But if this goes on , we 'II have to do as the company says .
- I 'm sorry .
- That 's not enough .
What did he say ?
Why ask ?
It won 't help you any .
They 're going to sue you .
What ?
If they want to sue , Iet them .
They have the nerve to say such a thing ?
When the company was going bankrupt , I saved it .
I worked there for 20 years .
After everything I 've done for them , they can 't write off 300 yen ?
Your bIuster won 't help you here .
Go tell it to them .
But of course you don 't dare .
You won 't make any money fishing .
AII you do is drink .
What a disgrace .
If you dip into the firm 's money , at Ieast be able to repay it .
DabbIing in stocks .
fool .
What do you know about it ?
I 've done everything I couId for you two .
Both you and your sister Sachiko were able to go to school .
And Hiroshi went to the university .
I wonder what 's happened to him anyway .
He hasn 't written .
I hope he can find a good job .
When he graduates and starts working , we 'II all be better off . It won 't be long now .
What a good-for-nothing father .
Better to have no father at all .
Watch your mouth .
One can only pity the children of such a father .
UngratefuI wretch !
Who do you think raised you ?
My life will be ruined because of you .
If you don 't like it , get out .
You mean it ?
You bet I do . Go wherever you want .
Sister !
Sister !
I don 't want you to go !
Excuse me .
Hello ?
Good morning .
Is Ayako in ?
May I ask who you are ?
We work at the same office .
Is she in ?
I 'm afraid she 's not .
- Has she gone somewhere ?
- No ... but she hasn 't been home in four or five days .
So you don 't know where she is ?
We 've had no word .
I see .
Sorry to trouble you .
So she hasn 't been at the office either ?
No .
I thought she might be ill .
Someone said she had quit .
really ?
Good-bye .
Good-bye .
Sachiko !
Who was that man ?
- Someone from Ayako 's office .
I thought it was someone from my company .
Letters for you , Father .
" Tuition for the second term is still unpaid .
There 's a chance of getting a job .
I 'm in a quandary .
I 've tried to raise some money , but my efforts have failed ... and so ... "
What 's this all about ?
Does Hiroshi think money grows on trees ?
What does Hiroshi say ?
He 's coming home to ask me for tuition .
Everybody just lets me down .
A letter from Ayako 's company .
" We request that you come to our offices at once . "
Has Ayako embezzIed money from work ?
What an awful child .
Sachiko , get my shoes .
Remember : not a word to my wife . Buy yourself a cup of tea .
welcome .
- Is she ... ?
- Yes , she 's here .
Thanks .
- Oh , you 're here .
- I sure am .
It 's a fine day .
Why so glum ?
Because you were late .
really ?
About your father : It will all be taken care of .
Thank you very much .
Three hundred yen as promised .
Thank you .
You 'd better take the money to your father 's company as soon as possible .
- I 'II do that at once .
- Good .
Is it noon already ?
Did you eat ?
No , I waited for you .
- I 'II go get something .
- No , I 'II go .
Don 't bother . Let me .
That 's kind of you .
I can really feel it .
I can really feel it !
If I die , don 't cremate me .
This old house may look sturdy , but its roof and joists have gone to ruin .
Father , don 't exaggerate .
The first dose is done .
I just felt a draft .
Someone must have opened the door .
I 'II close it .
Leave it be .
It 's gloomy enough in here as it is .
Right , Hisamatsu ?
Hey , pay attention to what you 're doing .
I was paying attention .
Hey , don 't look !
This is not the right time .
He signals to her with a look .
Why shouldn 't Omitsu look ?
She 's applying moxa to my foot .
And what exactly do you mean , " not the right time " ?
What I mean is that , according to the almanac , today is an unlucky day for moxibustion .
Nonsense !
The reason I 'm so fit is because of my regular moxa treatments .
It 's as good as exercise !
The skillful application of moxa is an act of filial piety .
You 're quite right .
I 'd Iike to burn some moxa at the threshold to cure Hisamatsu of the chronic disease that makes her flap her beautiful kimono sleeves and invite men in .
Ouch ! Omitsu , what are you doing ?
That 's my head !
You put it on my head !
You put it on the wrong acupuncture point !
- Big trouble !
- What is it ?
- She 's coming .
- Who ? Your wife !
Doctor !
well , you seem to be enjoying yourself .
Sorry to trouble you .
So Ayako ... when was your wedding ?
A married woman 's coiffure suits you .
I 'm terribly sorry I failed to send a wedding present .
And you !
What ?
" What , " you say ?
You can come to the theater with her but not with me ?
I think there 's a misunderstanding .
No , I understand very clearly . I 'm not blind .
- Be quiet , dear .
- " Dear " ?
I meant ... be quiet .
Stop pretending .
And you ! How dare you -
- Wait !
- Wait for what ?
I 'm so angry !
I 've been made a Iaughing-stock !
- Don 't make a scene .
You needn 't trouble yourself .
It 's the illness that makes him say such spiteful things .
- It 's a ridiculous role to play .
- lt 's our only option .
Do I have to ?
What a thing to ask !
Asai !
I 'm so sorry . I 've kept you waiting .
Mr. Fujino , listen !
My husband brought this woman here .
Just think of it .
I 'm so humiliated .
What ?
You didn 't think that Asai and Ayako -
Look at her , flaunting a married woman 's coiffure .
And you thought -
You 're terribly mistaken .
I 'm the one who promised to take her to the theater , but then something came up .
I 'm sorry my being late caused such confusion .
Ayako , didn 't you try to explain to Mrs. Asai ?
Go on , explain yourself .
You mean Ayako had a theater date with you ?
That 's right , though I 'm quite embarrassed about it .
Asai , my apologies .
Ayako , Iet 's go inside .
- Excuse me .
- Fujino , are you -
- Don 't worry .
well , don 't dawdIe out here .
Let 's go in .
What are you doing ?
welcome .
May I see some lipstick , please ?
What about this ?
Ayako !
Ayako , is that you ?
- Susumu !
I thought it was you , but you look so different .
Your hair ... Did you get married ?
It 's nothing like that .
But your hair -
I 'm working at a beauty parlor .
The other girls practice on me .
Is that so ?
I 'm so relieved .
I was afraid you were ill .
I went to your house to check .
You weren 't there , and then the money problem -
I 'm sorry .
Father and I had a fight .
I Ieft home and can 't go back .
That won 't do .
It 's all because of that money .
Father keeps pushing me to marry a man I dislike .
That 's why I ran away from home .
really ?
Didn 't you know your father 's working for our company ?
He is ?
No , I didn 't know .
please don 't tell Father that we met .
Where are you living ?
Where am I living ?
I 'm staying with a friend , so I 'm afraid you can 't visit .
Ayako ... sitting here like this ... we look like newlyweds .
Ayako ... will you marry me ?
Let 's get married .
Do you really mean it ?
Do I mean it ?
Why would I lie about something so serious ?
Come on .
Let 's get married .
I have to go .
Ayako !
- How is your husband ?
- Doctor !
I heard he 's laid up in bed .
How high is his fever ?
Who told you that ?
Didn 't you call me ?
call you ?
Who could it have been ?
Oh , no !
Wait a minute !
- I 'm going to find out .
- No , don 't !
Get me the doctor 's office .
hello ?
This is Mrs. Asai .
Who phoned for the doctor ?
- What a disaster !
- What is it ?
I accidentally went to your house .
She found out .
She 's coming -
You !
How dare you make a Iaughing-stock of me like this !
shameful , just shameful !
What a disgrace !
It serves you right to fall ill .
Get up .
- He has a high fever .
Who do you think you are ?
Shut up .
I 'II have a look .
No , I won 't have him staying here .
It 's all right .
My fever 's gone down .
You 're despicable .
What 's this lewd thing you 're wearing ?
Have you forgotten that you 're the owner , at Ieast in name , of Asai pharmaceuticals ?
Yet you 're still the servile little toad you always were .
Why did you do this ?
Was it some kind of grudge ?
It was a mistake .
You 're in cahoots with him .
Mitani .
Take him home .
will you be all right ?
Sorry about this . I 'II see you again .
Oh no , you won 't , imbecile .
You think I 'II ever let you see her again ?
Go quickly !
It 's frightening how well you feign innocence .
Don 't ever seduce my husband again .
You can have him .
You 've ruined everything .
I 'm sorry . That 's all I can say .
Don 't worry too much .
I 'II find a nice man for you .
I 'm through with men .
Now , don 't despair .
I 'm actually relieved .
I don 't want to wind up like this again .
What I 'd really like is to marry a nice man .
Yes , that would be much better .
You know ... there 's a young man I have in mind .
I haven 't told him that I 've been living like this .
I want to marry him .
You think I should tell him everything ?
I don 't know .
It depends .
If you both love each other that much , I think he 'd understand .
I guess so .
My mind 's made up .
I 'II marry him .
I 'II see him tomorrow .
Sister !
Where have you been ?
What does it matter ?
Ayako ...
Hiroshi 's back home .
school vacation ?
He needs money .
Money ?
He 's about to graduate , but his tuition hasn 't been paid .
He 's got a job lined up after graduation , but it requires guarantee money .
How much does he need ?
He says about 200 yen .
He 'II never find that kind of money at home .
What did Father say ?
He said he 'II get it somehow , but he just started working again .
I don 't see how he can .
could you help Hiroshi ?
How do you expect me to if Father can 't ?
Leave me out of it .
Hiroshi wasn 't expecting you to help anyway !
And he shouldn 't !
Ayako !
Hiroshi called you trash when he heard you left home .
Do you think I care ?
I 'II live as I please .
That stupid jerk can 't boss me around .
Fine !
If that 's how you feel , you 're on your own .
fool !
Sachiko , can you bring more tea ?
" When I ran into Sachiko , she told me about Hiroshi 's tuition .
I 'm enclosing money that I borrowed .
please don 't tell Hiroshi it 's from me . "
Thanks .
Father , what does Ayako say in her letter ?
Just a Iot of nonsense .
She says she 's sorry and wants to come back home .
Don 't let her in the house . I won 't allow it .
No need for a letter if she had come home when I told her to .
POSTAL MONEY ORDER 200 YEN
So we were meant to be together after all .
unfortunately .
Now that 's uncaIIed-for .
I don 't think I 'm too shabby compared to Asai .
Is that right ?
What a coId-hearted answer !
Yes , coming !
What are you doing , Ayako ?
What 's going on ?
He 'd Iike you to send for his favorite geisha .
Just sit there and take it easy .
You just take the money and run ?
Think you 'II get away with that ?
Good-bye now .
Wait !
Some people might put up with that ... but I won 't !
You haven 't heard the Iast of me .
What happened ?
What 's it to you ?
Stop pestering me or I won 't pay the bill .
Forgive me .
Thank you .
hello ?
Yes , it is .
Ayako !
Where have you been ?
I was worried about you .
I 'd Iike to talk to you about something , but not on the phone .
You know the Suminoe Suites ?
could you meet me there ?
Is that where you are ?
really ?
I 'II be there right away .
You will ?
Promise ?
I promise .
I 've been wanting to see you too .
until then .
- Thanks .
- Hot date ?
Stop kidding me !
Good-bye .
Susumu , up here !
Come on up .
Sorry to keep you waiting . I came as fast as I couId .
I 'm so happy you came .
I 've missed you .
Same for me .
I 'm so happy .
I feel very happy too .
Have some tea .
Susumu ... remember how you said you wanted to marry me ?
Yes , I do .
Do you really love me with all your heart ?
You ought to know that by now .
- Do you ?
- Do you have to keep asking ?
Then no matter what I may have done ... you 'd be willing to understand ?
Of course .
You see ... I told you I was working at a beauty parlor . That was a lie .
After I quit the company ...
I became Mr. Asai 's mistress .
Is that really true ?
Yes , it is .
That money ... If you could have gotten me that money ...
I wouldn 't have had to do it .
I wish things could have gone that way .
But all that time , I kept thinking only of you and dreaming of someday becoming your wife .
If things go on like this ... who knows how much further I 'II fall .
When I think about that , I can 't help but feel sorry for myself .
please , Susumu . will you marry me ?
I realize I may have betrayed you .
If you feel I did , I 'II do anything to apologize and make amends .
please marry me !
You will , won 't you ?
Miss Murai !
What are you doing , you fool ?
Don 't interfere !
What is it ?
What do you want ?
You certainly made a fool of me earlier .
earlier ?
You 'II have to refresh my memory .
- You little brat !
- You don 't say .
Try as you might , you 're not weaseIing out of it this time .
You 're more persistent than I thought .
people dislike that , you know .
Thanks for the advice .
Why don 't you just forget it ?
That 's right . Just go home quietly .
What are you doing , you fool ?
I 've got a houseguest who 's a tough character .
Come on out .
You 're bluffing .
I said to come out here .
He may look gentle , but he 's vicious when mad .
Leave now before you get hurt .
Give me the money .
Don 't know when to give up , do you ?
What 's two or three hundred yen ?
You could lose that much playing the market .
Be a good boy and go on home .
You don 't intend to return it ?
You know what 'II happen to you .
No , what ? I have no idea .
- You 'II be crying later .
- Make me cry , then .
Very well .
He 's finally gone .
Ayako , wasn 't that Mr. Fujino ?
Does that mean you and he -
Of course not , silly .
Don 't worry .
Come sit down .
Now all of the obstacles have been cleared .
We 're alone , just you and me .
He might do something .
There 's no need to worry .
I 'm not afraid of whatever he may do as long as I have your love .
You 'II stand by me , won 't you ?
You will , right ?
I 'm so glad .
I 'II cook a big dinner .
Ayako .
I 'm leaving .
Leaving ?
What are you saying ?
Stop kidding around .
Ayako Murai ?
Come with us to the police station .
You too .
What 's this about ?
You 'II find out at the station .
Chief , tell us more about the Ayako Murai case .
gentlemen , please .
We heard about it at the Suminoe Suites .
She 's an unfortunate woman .
Don 't write it up .
We want details .
I 'II give you the general gist .
Why don 't you say something ?
You 're getting on my nerves .
How about a full confession ?
Listen ... you can 't hide anything from us .
We 'II find out eventually .
That 's our job .
tell me , why 'd you do it ?
- I 'm sorry .
- That 's no help .
You had to have a reason .
I 'm sure there were extenuating circumstances ... but you do realize it was wrong , don 't you ?
If so , don 't hide it . tell me everything .
AII right ?
The law hates the crime but not the individual .
Just tell us the facts and apologize , and that will be that .
I 'm sorry .
I did it simply because I wanted to marry Nishimura .
In that case ... why didn 't you talk things over with Mr. Fujino ?
I thought about that , but he 's not the type to listen .
If he were , I wouldn 't have done what I did .
It was the only way to get him to leave .
So was this drama all Nishimura 's doing ?
Don 't lie !
Anyway , think it over .
Take over here .
tell us the truth and we 'II let you go home quickly .
You told her what to do .
No , that 's not true .
I knew nothing about it .
She dragged me along the whole time .
I really didn 't know anything .
Liar !
You made her do it because you wanted to marry her .
That 's not true !
Who told you that ? Never mind who .
Is it true or not ?
absolutely not .
I have no desire to marry her .
Then why were you there ?
She deceived me .
I didn 't realize she was such a terrible woman .
She deceived me .
You 're some excuse for a man .
She had another man before Mr. Fujino .
There may have been others .
please !
If people think I conspired with her , I 'II lose my job .
I have no parents or relatives .
If I 'm fired , I don 't know what I 'II do .
What a muddIe-headed sap !
Wait here .
You can send him home .
You 're quite a piece of work !
You think so ?
- Susumu !
- Keep quiet !
He says you pulled the strings .
- Here she is .
- AII right .
You 'd better mend your ways .
It 's her first offense and she 's shown remorse , so we 're dropping the charges .
I 'm sorry for all the trouble .
But don 't let it happen again .
Make sure you keep an eye on her .
Yes , I will .
I 'm back .
Father , have some dinner .
Hiroshi , how are you ?
You haven 't gone back to Tokyo yet ?
You 're looking well , as always .
Sachiko , how are you ?
My , that looks delicious .
Sukiyaki ?
I 'II have some too .
We 're all together again .
There 's no place like home .
I 'm so happy .
It 's been so long since we all shared a meal .
Right , Father ?
And you can rest easy .
You have a job now .
And Hiroshi will graduate soon .
He 'II take a respected place in society .
That just leaves Sachiko .
How did your exams go ?
will you serve me some rice ?
Why 's everyone so quiet ?
A delinquent like you is no sister of mine .
- What did you call me ?
- A delinquent .
- Thanks a Iot !
Father , didn 't you promise not to let her back in the house ?
She can 't stay here . I won 't allow it .
- You saying I should leave ?
- That 's right .
Maybe you think so , but Father and Sachiko wouldn 't kick me out , right ?
Don 't ask me .
I 'm ashamed to go to school after that big newspaper write-up .
I can 't even face my friends .
Right , Father ?
My own daughter ... arrested by the police and put in jail .
It 's shameful .
You 're a disgrace and an ingrate .
Is that so ?
I never thought I 'd be treated like this in my own home .
This is ridiculous .
I thought I 'd be welcomed .
I should 've never come back .
Ayako , what 's going on ?
What are you doing here ?
I 'm just a stray dog .
I don 't know what to do .
Are you ill ?
I guess you could say that .
I have a serious illness called " delinquency . "
tell me , Doctor .
- What ? How can a condition like this be cured ?
Even I don 't know the answer to that .

Warden , where does that fellow with the guitar hang out ?
Down there , at the other end of the prison .
- I 'd like to see him for a while .
- Well , Hart , you know ...
I 'm the star boarder of this hotel tonight .
You 're supposed to cater to me .
Yes , I know . But once you leave your cell , according to regulations ...
Oh , you can 't be too technical at a time like this .
I can 't see that it 'd do any harm , Warden .
All right .
But just for a minute , remember .
Hart 's the name .
Yeah , I know .
I 'm glad to meet you , Hart .
Mine 's Poole , Larry Poole .
Much obliged for the music .
You sure tease pretty tunes out of that guitar .
Oh , that 's not a guitar .
It 's a lute , 13th century lute .
Whatever it is , you sure got it locked .
And you got a swell pair of pipes too .
Many 's the time I heard you out there in the yard .
It kind of took my mind off things .
The chaplain tells me you 're due out of here next week .
Where do you aim to go ?
Well , it depends on the wind .
You see , with me , when I leave a place ... I get myself a feather and toss it up ... and whichever way the wind blows , that 's where I go .
Swell .
Let me toss the feather for you this time .
Here 's a letter I want delivered .
It goes to some people named Smith .
They live somewhere around Middletown , New Jersey .
I don 't know the address .
That 's why I can 't mail it .
Well , why do you want me to deliver it ?
Because you 're the only guy around here I can trust .
Anybody that can sing sappy , sentimental songs in prison ... wouldn 't double-cross a guy taking his last walk .
It 's mighty important that that letter gets to those people .
- Will you deliver it for me ?
- Why , I 'll be glad to .
Thanks .
Gee , that 's a load off my mind .
- So long .
- So long .
Okay , folks .
Let 's go .
Come on , folks .
Six rings for a dime .
A dime , six rings .
Anyone can do it .
Come on , folks , six rings for a dime .
A dime , six rings .
There you are .
Six rings for a dime , folks .
Six rings for a dime .
Step right up and ring ' em and take home a present .
Hold it .
- What are you after ?
- Them .
Can 't be done .
Here .
Hey , what 's the idea ?
You see there ?
No can do .
- Oh , a wise guy .
- Sister , you see that cop over there ?
- Run on over and tell him ...
- Now , wait a minute , pal .
Them opera glasses must have gotten there by mistake .
- Mm-hmm .
- Here 's your dime back .
My dime ?
Listen , I 've been coming here every day since this carnival opened .
I spent lots of dimes !
Hundreds and millions , and I don 't want my dime back !
I want those opera glasses !
And those glasses you shall have , unless you want to yell , " Hey , rube . "
Well , if she wants them that bad , why , she can have ' em .
There you are , sister .
Thank the nice man .
Thank you , you crook !
Gee , aren 't they elegant !
Elegant ?
They 're just the last gasp in binoculars , that 's all .
Hey , look .
The ground comes way up here .
Look out you don 't step on your chin .
- What 's your name ?
- Larry .
What 's yours ?
Patricia .
But my intimate friends call me Sarge .
Sarge . Oh !
Mind if I call you Sarge ?
No .
You 're the most intimate friend I 've got .
I 'm awfully glad to meet you .
You 're not half as glad as I am to meet you . I 've been looking all over for you .
Took me almost three weeks to locate you .
Your name is Smith and you live over here on Railroad Avenue .
- How did you know ?
- I was by your house this morning .
The people next door told me I 'd find you here at the carnival .
They said to look for a little girl with a red feather in her cap .
Said she had on a brown ... Hey !
Hey , wait a minute !
Oh , no , you don 't .
I had to check off 165 Smiths to find you , and I ain 't gonna lose you now .
- Are you a cop ?
- Do I look like one ?
Well , are you an installment collector ?
- No , I should say not .
- Then what do you want ?
- I got something for you .
- What ?
Hadn 't we better tell that to the head of the family ?
Is there somebody else ?
My grandpa .
There 's just me and Gramp .
I tell you what we 'll do then . We 'll tell your gramp .
- If that 's okay with you ?
- Sure .
And you can stay for lunch .
- Gramp 's got a nice big ham . - Why , I 'd love to .
Gramp gave me a dime to get a loaf of bread ... and I spent it on the rings .
Well , if Gramp can furnish the ham , the least I can do is furnish the bread .
Oops .
I 'm flat myself .
Madam , I am temporarily without funds .
That 's all right .
We can eat the ham without the bread .
Oh , we 'll get pennies enough for bread .
- Where ?
- From heaven .
On a lonely road or sidewalk
It doesn 't matter where
I 've always felt that I 'd walk
Into my love affair
And on that perfect day
I 'd say
The breeze runs after you
When you 're passing by
It wants to be near
And so do I
The willow bows to you
Forgetting to cry
It waits for your smile
And so do I
All the world 's at your command
What wouldn 't it do
For one look at you
And I 'm that way too
The rose
That you caress
Is willing to die
It loves you so very much
And so
Do I
- Let 's do it again !
- Oh , no , Sarge .
You give ' em a little , they throw coins . Give ' em too much , they throw eggs .
- What do you suppose that means ?
- Let 's find out !
- Patsy !
- Hey , Sarge !
Wait !
Come back here .
- What 's this all about ?
- That 's just what I want to find out .
Come in .
Don 't come close to me .
I have a cold .
Okay , I won 't .
- Gesundheit .
- Thank you .
What were you doing down there in that yard with Patsy ?
Oh , we were serenading the world .
Tell me something . What made that kid take off like a rabbit when she saw you ?
Guilty conscience .
She 's playing hooky .
Bless you .
Say , you know that oil of balsam is good for that .
Never mind oil of balsam or any other kind of oil .
Answer my question .
What makes you so interested about this kid ? What is it ?
I work for the welfare department , and it 's my job ... to look after the problem children of this county .
Oh , is Patsy such a problem ?
Problem ?
I 've got 20 to look after ... and she 's more trouble than all the rest put together .
- Bless you .
- Oh , stop blessing me !
That child 's supposed to be in school , and I find her dancing for pennies !
What 's the matter with that ?
It keeps the kid out in the open , doesn 't it ?
Who are you ?
I 've never seen you around here anyway .
I 'm the last of the troubadours .
- If you think this is a joking matter ...
- I 'm not joking .
Seriously , I 'm just a harmless guy , the friend of man .
I envy nobody , and I 'm sure nobody envies me .
If I were you , I wouldn 't get myself into a temperature over this thing .
- It 's bad for your cold .
- Never mind my cold .
- Not too close .
- I 'm sorry .
- Are you related to Patsy ?
- No , just a friend of the family .
Do you know that she 's in danger of being sent to an orphanage ?
I 've been trying to prevent it , but if this goes on , I don 't see how I can .
What 's wrong with an orphanage ?
I was raised in one .
It didn 't hurt me any .
- It didn 't do you any good .
- What 's the matter with me ?
If you want my opinion , you seem to be nothing more than a shiftless loafer !
You seem to be nothing more than a nosey , meddlesome busybody !
If you 'd been raised in an orphanage , you might have learned manners !
I 'm sorry , perhaps I was mistaken .
Perhaps you 're not really a loafer , even if you do look like one .
Just what do you do for a living ?
Oh , I eat , drink , sleep , and I mind my own business .
That 's a formula I highly recommend , especially the last part .
Well , here 's your money back .
Guess you just don 't like music .
Oh , say , I hope that cold is nothing trivial .
- Hello , Gramp .
- Hello .
I see the landlord 's been here .
Yes , he came with a couple of men .
They left a little while ago .
Oh , this is Larry , my most intimate friend .
- What 's your other name ?
- Poole .
How do you do ?
I 'm sorry I can 't invite you inside , but we 've been dispossessed .
- That 's too bad .
- That 's all right .
The furniture don 't belong to us .
We never have to send it back .
The installment people always come after it .
That 's nice of them , isn 't it ?
Good to see that you 're not put out about being put out .
No . It happens all the time .
Sure . We move in one house and stay a while till the landlord puts us out .
- We never pay any rent .
- Of course that 's only temporary .
Pretty soon I expect to come into a regular income of $ 200 a month .
Quite ample for our simple needs .
- Larry 's gonna stay for lunch .
- Delighted !
Provided you don 't mind dining in the open .
Oh , no , I prefer it .
- Won 't you sit down ?
- Show him the ham .
- Ain 't it elegant ?
- Oh , a dandy .
We won it at a raffle .
- Hey , look !
Miss Sprague !
- Beat it !
Charming landscape , is it not ?
Patsy 's very good at finding such places .
Say , Gramp , tell me something , will you ?
Does the name Hart mean anything to you ?
If you mean the criminal who was recently electrocuted ...
- That 's the fellow .
- His name does mean something to me .
He is the man who killed Patsy 's father .
He gave me a letter for you .
Here it is .
A key .
What 's it for ?
Read the letter .
No , I haven 't my glasses .
Will you read it for me , please ?
Sure .
" You know I never meant to kill Smith .
All the time I was in prison I kept thinking about his family ... and how they must have been up against it after I killed him .
So I thought I would leave all I have to the family of this man Smith .
Just an old house in New Jersey ... that I used to use for a hideout .
I hope it brings you better luck than it brought me.J.C. Hart . "
No .
No , I could never live in a house that belonged to that man .
Why not ?
Probably the only decent thing he ever tried to do .
Let him do it .
Poor fellow 's dead now .
Look , you 've just been thrown out of your house , haven 't you ?
Well , here 's another one all set up and ready for you to live in .
Besides , you have to think of Patsy , you know .
Thank you , Mr. Cow .
There 's a postscript here on the letter .
Says the house is ... " on a road off the main highway about five miles out of Middletown . "
- Oh , bless my soul , child .
- Oh , dear .
Old McDonald had a farm E - l-E-l-O
And on the farm he had a duck E - l-E-l-O
With a quack , quack here And a quack , quack there
Here a quack , there a quack Everywhere a quack , quack
Old McDonald had a farm E - l-E-l-O
Oh , Patsy Smith is a pain in the neck E - l-E-l-O
Yes , she is She is , by heck
E - l-E-l-O
With I wanna go here and I won 't do that
And an old feather stuck in her hat
Patsy Smith is a pain in the neck E - l-E-l-O
- Is that a guitar
- That 's a lute
E - l-E-l-O
Whatever it is it 's sure a beaut E - l-E-l-O
- With a ...
- With a ...
Here , and a ... there Here a ... there a ... everywhere a ...
Larry 's got a lute E - l-E-l-O
- Hey , I know one .
- Is it a good one ?
- They seem to like it around here .
- Let 's hear it .
Old McDonald had a farm E - l-E-l-O
And on this farm he had a parrot E - l-E-l-O
With a ... and a ...
Did you tear something ?
Sounded bad .
Well , here we are .
Partner , I want to thank you very much for the lift .
That 's all right .
Glad of your company .
Gee , mister , you can sure twang on that there guitar .
- That ain 't no guitar .
- It 's a lute .
A 13th century lute !
Well , where 's this house now ?
It 's up there in those trees .
She 's staring you square in the face .
You ain 't gonna stay in that house ?
- Why not ?
- Didn 't you know that was haunted ? Why sure .
We 're the ghosts that haunt it .
Giddyap !
Maybe we ought to stop over someplace in town tonight .
We can come in the morning .
That Hart probably started this haunted house talk ... just to keep people away from the hideaway .
Oh , hooey .
Here .
Hey , Gramp , let me get that .
Okay .
Come on in .
Join the spooks .
Go on , dear .
Well , come on in .
Nothing to be afraid of .
What 's the trouble , Sarge ?
I thought you said you were grown up .
- I am .
- You promised you wouldn 't be afraid .
I 'm not afraid , only ... it 's awful lonely in here ... and I keep seeing funny things in the dark .
- Why don 't you close your eyes ? - I do , but it gets worse .
Can I go downstairs with you , Larry ?
- What a pest .
- Just for a little while .
- You know you 're a nuisance ?
- Please ?
Why did I ever have to run into you , anyhow ?
There you are . Now stay put .
I 'll be right back .
Let 's stay up all night , huh ?
I 'll get Gramp 's chess board , and I 'll teach you how to play the game . No .
What do I want with chess , anyhow ?
I got troubles enough .
- What troubles have you got ?
- Mostly you .
- Me ?
- Yeah .
What 's the matter with me ?
You were born a female .
That was your first mistake .
All females are troublemakers , one way or another .
They slow you down , and they cramp your style .
Not me .
I 'm different .
Oh , no , you 're not .
Your friend Miss Sprague told me all about you .
Friend ?
She 's the worst enemy I 've got in the whole world .
Never mind about that .
You just hop right in here .
Come on .
Gee , this is the first time anybody ever tucked me in bed .
- Would you do it for me every night ?
- Every night ?
What do you think I 'm gonna do , live here ?
We could have an awful lot of fun .
Oh , no .
You 've held me up long enough already .
- I 'm leaving in the morning .
- Can I go with you ?
With me ?
I should say not .
I don 't carry any excess baggage .
That 's the secret of my success .
I won 't be any trouble .
Trouble 's your middle name .
Anyway , you wouldn 't want to leave Gramp , would you ?
Oh , no , but we could take him with us .
Take him with us ?
What are you figuring out for me ?
A cook 's tour ?
You just forget about it .
Close those eyes , and go to sleep .
I can 't go to sleep .
I 'm afraid .
The house is full of ghosts .
- Rats . - Where ?
No , no .
There . Now relax .
You know , Sarge ...
A long time ago
About a million years BC
The best things in life
Absolutely free
But no one appreciated A sky that was always blue
And no one congratulated
A moon that was always new
So it was planned that they would vanish now and then
And you must pay before you get them back again
That 's what storms were made for
And you shouldn 't be afraid for
Every time it rains it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don 't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You 'll find your fortune falling
All over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don 't run under a tree
There 'll be pennies from heaven
For you
And me
Well , there .
Check .
That means I gotta move my king out of danger , huh ?
Sure .
Young lady , something tells me you 're trying to pull a fast one .
If I move my king , you 're gonna grab my rook , aren 't you ?
Uh-huh .
And I 'll have you mated in three moves .
Oh , I guess I 'm no good at this game .
- Sure , you are !
- Nah .
You just can 't learn in a week .
I 've played for years , and besides , you don 't concentrate .
- Yes , I do .
- You 're thinking of something else .
Nope .
Hey !
Wait a minute .
Good afternoon .
Patsy seems to have remembered a sudden engagement .
Gee , I 'd hate to be somebody that makes children run away all the time .
- May I sit down ?
- Don 't come too close .
I 've got a cold .
You better sit there .
How 'd you know where we were ?
My own secret service .
Nice of you to take such an interest in me .
I don 't take any interest in you , not the slightest .
Then why are you snooping around here ?
Why don 't you mind your own business ?
This is my business . It 's my job to look after Patsy ... and I 'm not letting anyone stop me , least of all a hobo with a guitar .
In the first place , it 's not a guitar . It 's a lute .
Here , take a look at it .
It was made in the 13th century , long before we had any nosy social workers .
Probably belonged to some troubadour .
That 's me ... a troubadour , not a hobo .
- What 's the difference ?
- The difference ?
A hobo begs for his supper , and a troubadour sings for it .
- How romantic .
- Yes .
- You have a nice voice too .
- Thank you .
- I suppose you eat regularly ?
- Mm-hmm .
Sleep regularly , and ...
I know . Mind your own business .
- Right .
- Well , so do I. That 's why I 'm here .
Well , then I 'm glad you came .
If you hadn 't , I 'd have sent for you ... because there 's something you can do for me .
- What ?
- You can take this family off my hands .
I ought to be on a boat right now , bound for Venice .
What 's Venice got to do with it ?
Plenty . I 've got an idea they understand a guy with a lute over there .
It 's too bad that nobody understands you over here .
Do you know what will happen if this family is left to their own devices ?
Oh , I imagine they 'll struggle along all right .
Of course if you could convince me that you can support them properly .
- Support them ?
- Mm-hmm .
Are you married ?
No , I 'm sane .
Well , have you anybody at all that you have to take care of ?
Yeah ... me ... and I 'm not picking up anybody else .
You 're not gonna stick me with a kid and an old man .
The first time I met you , I said some things that I shouldn 't have ... so I came here to apologize .
But I see now I was right the first time .
Hey , my lute !
What 's the trouble ?
I thought you were my most intimate friend .
Well , who said I wasn 't ?
I heard you tell her that you don 't want me .
Well , I had to tell her something to get rid of her , didn 't I ?
And I heard you tell her you were gonna leave us . Why don 't you be reasonable ?
Look .
How long do you want me to hang around , and why do you want me to ? I 've fallen in love with you .
When did this happen ?
When you got me these . And I 'll give them to you if you 'll only stay .
You 're the worst pest I ever ran into .
Come on . Get outta there .
Alley-oop .
Alley-oop .
That 's the old sergeant .
Here are the commitment papers for the Smith child .
Yes , sir .
If they 'd been prepared weeks ago , you could have saved considerable trouble .
You 're quite right , Mr. Carmichael .
See that the child is taken to the orphanage in the morning . That 's all .
Get me the orphanage .
Come in .
- Well , good morning .
- Good morning .
- I thought you were going to Rome .
- Venice .
Oh , yes , of course . Venice .
Well , I 've postponed that , but I 've been postponing it all my life ... so once more won 't hurt .
We have a proposition we want to make .
Won 't you be seated ?
You bet .
There 's no need to hide .
Move your chair out there .
We have a problem , a situation that confronts a lot of people these days .
We want to be let alone .
That 's all we ask of the United States , New Jersey , Union County and you .
If you 'll just tell us what you want of us , we 'll see what we can do about it .
All I want is to see Patsy properly provided for .
What do you mean , " properly provided for " ?
I mean properly clothed and properly fed ... in a home where her schooling won 't be neglected ... where she won 't be subjected to the wrong sort of influence .
Oh . Meaning me .
- If the shoe fits .
- It pinches .
Hey , where are you going ?
I won 't live with anybody else but you and Gramp !
And they can 't make me !
Come on back and sit down , or I 'll walk out on the whole thing .
As I understand it your chief objection ... is neither Gramp nor I is what you 'd call regularly or gainfully employed .
- Correct .
- Well .
If I can show you we 're engaged in a going business , would that be all right ?
What kind ?
We went into a little huddle and decided to open a restaurant .
We 're gonna call it " The Haunted House Cafe . "
- It was my own idea .
- Quiet , Patsy .
Now , listen .
The place where we happen to be living has the reputation of being haunted .
So why not take advantage of it ?
We plan to put a lot of signs up and down the state highway .
Yeah .
Signs like skeletons .
And we propose to serve chicken dinners at very reasonable rates .
There will be music and songs provided by Mr. Poole here .
A little floor show .
Have any of you thought of a little thing like capital ?
Oh , we won 't need any ... not for chicken dinners .
I have it all figured out right here .
All we need to start is two chickens .
I mean a hen and a rooster .
When the hen starts laying at the rate of only one egg a day ... at the end of the first week we 'll have seven eggs .
Those seven eggs in turn will hatch , and at the end of the second cycle ... there will be 49 chickens .
Oh , Patsy . How many chickens will we have in three months at that rate ?
- 2,401 .
- You see ?
It 's simply a matter of arithmetic .
There ! Are you satisfied , Miss Sprague ?
No .
I still say what about capital ?
- What for ?
- What for !
Why , for kitchen equipment !
For pots , pans , knives , forks ...
We 're not worrying about finances .
Gramp tells me he 's coming into some money .
- When ?
- In the very near future .
Any day now . And regular income too .
How much of an income ?
Two hundred dollars a month .
Two hun ...
From what source ?
- The Townsend Plan .
- The Town ...
Oh , I see .
Well , just for the sake of argument , of course ... suppose the Townsend Plan doesn 't go into effect until after you 've started .
- Then what ?
- Your attitude is unfair .
Of course we need capital . Why don 't you let me take care of that ?
How ?
Singing in backyards ?
Well , that 's my problem .
If we can get away with this thing , is it all right ? Will you leave us alone ?
Yes . I 'll leave you alone .
As a matter of fact , I 'd like very much never to have to see you again .
You 'd be surprised how unanimous that is .
Come on , group .
Poor , homeless little chickies .
Looks elegant .
Looks real nice . I couldn 't have done better myself .
- Looks effective .
- You bet it does .
That 'll be $ 25 .
Deliver it , will you , and send me the bill ?
- That 's cash .
- Cash ?
- I 'll have to paint one myself .
- Wait a minute !
You 've got no license ordering signs without you can pay for them .
You 're right .
I did wrong .
You keep the sign .
But I don 't want it .
I got no use for it .
Well , I do want it .
I 've got some use for it .
Say , do you like chicken dinners ?
- Well , yes .
- That 's our out .
Now , the Excelsior Company is putting up $ 1,500 worth of supplies ... in exchange for 25 % of our business .
Your estimate for the costumes for the waiter and entertainers is only $ 1,000 .
But we 're not asking you to take a cut .
We 're gonna give you 25 % too .
And it 's a grand chance to get in on the ground floor .
Ground floor of what ?
What 's your secretary 's name ?
Myrtle .
Why ?
Hello , Myrt ?
Don 't put any calls through here for ten minutes . Right .
Tell me , Mr. Arbuthnot , what do you think of the restaurant business ?
Well , people 's got to eat .
It 's the best business there is .
- Good !
You 're in it .
- Huh ?
Here it is a week .
There ought to be a couple dozen chickens , and there 's only two .
- Good morning , Mr. Poole .
- Hello , Henry .
Make up your mind ?
Yes , sir , Mr. Poole .
But there 's a little trouble .
Trouble ?
Well , speak freely .
You see , I got the boys together ... and I told them you wanted us to play the music for you at the restaurant .
- That 's right .
- We 'd get ten percent of the business .
- And that 's where the trouble started .
- Don 't you think ten percent is enough ?
Yes and no .
Maybe it 's enough , and maybe it 's too much .
But you see , there 's seven men in the band .
- That 's counting you .
- Yeah , that 's right .
Counting me .
And none of us knows how to divide up ten percent by seven .
So if you could just only make it seven percent .
Seven percent ?
Henry , it 's a deal .
Oh , thank you , Mr. Poole !
I told them cats you 'd do the right thing .
Why , sure !
I 'll see you later . Yes .
What is the matter with them ?
I don 't know .
I 've tried everything , including prayer .
- Are you Mr. Poole ?
- Why ?
I have a telegram for you .
- Collect ?
- No .
Prepaid .
Well then , I 'm Mr. Poole .
Sign right here , please .
Well .
- I 'll tell you what 's wrong .
- Yes ?
- You see that one there ?
- Yeah .
That 's a hen .
Yes . I know . I know .
- See that one over there ?
- You mean the rooster ?
That ain 't no rooster .
What is it ?
Hey , what 's going on here ?
We 're supposed to open tomorrow night . I find you gazing at a hen and a rooster !
- Two hens , Mr. Poole .
- Disaster .
We 've just discovered there can be no increase in the poultry department .
It 's a beautiful time for that to happen .
What about tomorrow night ?
How are we gonna feed customers with only two hens ?
Mr. Poole , when do you have to have them chickens ?
We gotta have them the first thing in the morning !
First thing in the morning ?
And how many do you say you need ?
- Gotta have at least 50 .
- At least 50 .
How many chickens does each man have to get when you need 50 chickens ... and you 's got seven men ?
Well , if each man got seven chickens , that would be forty-nine .
Forty-nine .
Well , I think we can do it .
- You can ?
- Yes , sir .
If you do , I 'll make it 14 % instead of seven .
That 's two percent apiece .
- Now I know we can do it !
- Swell .
I 'll tell you just how we 're gonna go about it .
- Yeah ?
- As it gets dark tonight ...
There 's an old deserted mansion
On an old forgotten road
Where the better ghosts and goblins always hang out
One night they threw a party
In a manner a la mode
And they cordially invited all the gang out
At a dark , bewitching hour
When the fun was loud and hearty
A notorious wallflower
Became the life of the party
The spooks were having their midnight fling
Merrymaking was in full swing
They shrieked themselves into a cheerful trance
When the skeleton in the closet started to dance
Now a goblin , he giggled with fiendish glee
A shout rang out from a big banshee
Amazement was in every ghostly glance
When the skeleton in the closet
Started to dance
Now all the witches were in stitches
While his steps made rhythmic thumps
And they nearly dropped their broomsticks
When he tried to do the bumps
You never heard such unearthly laughter
Or such hilarious groans
When the skeleton in the closet
Rattled his bones
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
That cat don 't want no more of me .
I 'm telling you that much . Look out there .
One and two !
I made a deal to get my meals free .
See the boss .
I don 't pay any checks around here . I 'm one of the owners .
I don 't know the art of elocution
I 'm no good at thinking on my feet
I make no poetic contribution
Even when you offer me a seat
I 've thrown away expressions one by one
I 'm at a loss
And something must be done
When we 're in a friendly situation
My conversation
May not be smart
But if we 're to have a perfect understanding
Let 's call a heart a heart
There are words that should be whispered gently
That 's evidently The way to start
If I tell you what my dreams have been demanding
Let 's call a heart a heart
Can I prove how I yearn
Just by the turn of a phrase
Can I keep my control
When all my soul is ablaze
Maybe you would call a true confession
An indiscretion
On someone 's part
But if I 'm to say how madly I adore you
Let 's call a heart
A heart
And let 's call a spade a spade too .
If your menu had any humble pie , I 'd eat it .
I was wrong , and I humbly apologize .
There 's no doubt about it , the cafe is a tremendous success ... and I didn 't think you could do it .
Oh , I had to .
You made me do it .
Did you enjoy your dinner ?
- Very much .
- Music okay ?
Mm-hmm . It 's delightful .
- You like the looks of the place ?
- Charming .
If I could show you where we could put this place on a paying basis ... so it could provide a comfortable income for Patsy and Gramp ... would you be satisfied ?
I 'd be more than satisfied .
I 'd be awfully happy .
Then everybody 'd be happy .
- You too ?
- Me too .
'Cause then I 'd be on my way to Venice .
Why are you so keen about Venice ?
Ah , you wouldn 't ask that if you 'd ever been there .
It 's the most beautiful spot in the world .
Why , Venice has got all the postcards you 've ever seen whipped to a frazzle .
You haven 't lived until you 've floated down the Grand Canal in a gondola ... especially on a feast day with the colored lights and the flowers ... and the people singing and laughing , and guitars .
You know a great deal about Venice .
Were you by any chance born there ?
No .
I was born in Mukilteo , Washington .
But you 've spent a great deal of time in Venice .
No . I 've never been there .
But I wanted to go ever since I was a little sprout ... but it looked as though every time I got set to go ... something happened and sent me somewhere else .
As , for instance , prison ?
How 'd you know about that ?
I checked up .
It was for my own information , of course .
I didn 't let them know at the office .
I guess you found out what I was in for , didn 't you ?
Smuggling .
Yeah .
That was on account of Venice too .
See , I didn 't have enough dough to take passage on a regular ship ... so I stowed away on a freighter ... and they raided the freighter before they got up anchor .
Turned out to be a smuggling ship .
Judge wouldn 't believe me .
- I guess you don 't either , do you ?
- Yes , I do .
You do ?
Well , come here .
What made you do that ?
Oh , I don 't know .
I just played an impulse .
I guess I wanted to see what it was like .
It was swell .
Your lips are nice and cool .
- You don 't mind an audience , do you ?
- Not in the least .
Do you mind if I obey an impulse too ?
Not at all .
Good night , Mr. Poole .
Check , sir .
Just skip it , sonny .
I 'm one of the big owners of the place .
Say , mister , you better get yourself a new waiter .
I just figured out the checks , and everybody seems to be a partner .
The way it adds up , you 've sold 110 % of this restaurant !
I agreed to work here for my tips , and there aren 't no tips .
The only paying customer was that dame that just left .
She gimme a dime .
Here , you take it .
You might need it . And here 's your ribs .
Might need those too .
Good-bye .
- You Mr. Poole ?
- Yeah .
You run this place ?
Well , in a manner of speaking , yes .
Well , where 's your license ?
What license ?
Don 't you know you need a tavern license ... to operate an eatin ' place in this county ?
Drat .
Now , how could I have overlooked that ?
Certainly glad you dropped in to remind me .
Just what does one of these licenses cost ?
$ 100 , and you can 't start doing business without one .
Well , naturally .
Say , have you got a card you can let me have ?
Thanks .
I 'll be down to take care of it first thing in the morning .
Okay .
We open at 9 : 00 .
Oh , now looka here .
You told me you were gonna stay upstairs .
Oh , I just couldn 't stay up there .
When I saw Miss Sprague leave , I just had to come down for one little look .
- Ain 't it an elegant opening night ?
- You mean " closing night . "
Sergeant , you see gathered about you tonight ... more deadheads than have ever been collected under a single roof .
And they 're all in on rain checks .
The headwaiter just quit too .
When our entertainers find out what their percentage is ... I have an idea they 'll also quit .
We got bills up to here .
The tax collector was in to tell me ... if we don 't get a license , he 's gonna close us up .
The license costs $ 100, and we haven 't got a hundred cents .
Gee , what are we gonna do ?
Let 's dance .
- Madam , you know you dance divinely ? - Thank you . You dance elegant yourself .
Good evening , gentlemen .
Some nice chicken dinners tonight ?
See ?
What did I tell ya ?
There they are !
Those are the fellas that stole our chickens !
Come on !
Look out !
The law , gentlemen !
What 's the trouble ?
- If you let us have a little while ...
- You 're breakin ' the law as it is .
I 'll give you only 24 hours to get that license .
There 's no work attached to it whatsoever .
And the pay is incredulous ...
a dollar a second .
Thirty dollars for thirty seconds , twice a day .
Doin ' what ?
You know , this guy Devlin I was usin ' to do these loop the loops , he was no good .
No . In fact , he did me a favor when he got cracked up .
We 're gonna get a lot of publicity from this accident .
And from now on , we 'll do a world of business .
Well , what do you say ?
What do I know about death in the afternoon ?
Don 't pay any attention to that . That 's just the billing ' .
Hello ?
Hello ?
Oh , hello , Larry .
What ?
Over to the fairgrounds ?
Patsy and me ?
All right . Yeah , surely .
We 'll be right over .
It 's Larry . He wants us to come over to the fairgrounds .
He says it 's a surprise . Come on .
Let 's go .
Wait .
- Wonder where Larry is .
- He doesn 't hurry , he 'll miss the show .
Gee , that 's gettin ' higher all the time .
- Which one loops the loop ?
- The front one .
Okay , I 'll ride the back one .
- No .
I 've got a dummy nailed in there .
- A dummy ?
Yes .
Listen , you got nothing to be afraid of . It 's child 's play .
- Why don 't you do it yourself ? - Well , who 's gonna make the spiel ?
Grandpa !
Grandpa , look ! It 's Larry !
Now , ladies and gentlemen , I take great pleasure in introducing to you ... the one and only Dare Devil Devlin ... in the most daring act ever conceived by mortal mind ... or executed by man born of woman .
He 'll thumb his nose , ladies and gentlemen , at the Grim Reaper ! He will defy death .
The one and only Dare Devil Devlin !
Are you ready ?
- No , can 't handle it .
- Okay !
Let her go !
Larry , are you hurt ?
No , I 'm all right , Sarge .
I must 've stubbed my toe .
Don 't worry , kid .
- The hospital expenses are on me .
- Please , get some water .
Hey , Gramp !
Come on in !
Well , what 's the matter ?
What 's happened ?
Where 's Patsy ?
She 's gone .
They 've taken her away .
An officer is on his way to the orphanage now with the child .
Yes , Miss Howard , a most troublesome case .
- I 'm glad it 's finally settled . - May I be the first to congratulate you ?
Would you mind explaining why you saw fit ... to have a hearing about the Smith child without telling me ?
We decided we didn 't need your help in the matter .
This is my case . You had no right to go over my head .
I 'm under the impression that I 'm still the head of this bureau .
That may be , but it 's no excuse for what you 've done .
You took advantage of the fact that Mr. Poole is lying in the hospital ... to send that child to an asylum .
It doesn 't alter the fact that he 's a penniless hobo .
No , he 's not .
He 's a free soul and lives a free life .
I only wish I had the courage to be like him .
That gal did it .
She took advantage of the fact I 'm in the hospital .
And they left instructions not to let you come to the orphanage .
- That 's part of the court order .
- Yeah .
- She took care of that too , I suppose .
- Oh , my boy , please get back in bed .
Remember , you 're still in bandages .
Yes , and that 's her fault too .
Everything 's her fault !
Hadn 't been for her , I 'd be in Venice now havin ' the time of my life .
I regret to have to say this to you .
Up to now you 've been a faithful and trustworthy worker .
I know .
You 're going to give me the air .
I could do with some air . I never knew till now how stuffy it is in here .
You don 't have to run away from me now .
- What do you want ?
- I want to help you .
Oh , no , you don 't .
You hate me .
You 've always hated me .
That 's why I 'm here now . It 's all your fault .
Maybe it 's my fault , but it 's not because I hate you .
Oh , I wish we could be good friends .
- You couldn 't be a friend of mine .
- Why not ?
Because you don 't get along with Larry .
He 's the most intimate friend I 've got in the world ... and you 're against him .
No , I 'm not .
Mr. Carmichael fired me because I stood up for him .
- You did ?
- Mm-hmm .
And I had nothing to do with you being sent here .
I didn 't even know about it .
Why , you didn 't see me at the court hearing , did you ?
Larry always said as soon as he could get rid of you ... he 's gonna take me and Gramp to Venice .
That 's in Italy .
He thought maybe over there they 'd leave him alone .
That 's the ambition of his life ... to be let alone .
Do you know the ambition of my life ?
To get you to like me and trust me and not run away every time you see me .
- But I ...
- Come closer .
I want to tell you something .
Oh , no , real close .
It 's a secret .
Promise never to tell a living soul , especially Larry .
Well ...
I like Larry very much .
And I like you too .
I always have .
Oh , Miss Sprague .
- Perhaps he 's asleep . - I 'll see .
Oh , dear !
Look , Crowbar , you know all the circus people around here .
You round them up to play a benefit at the orphanage . I 'll do the rest .
- Mrs. Howard .
- Good afternoon .
It was so generous of the carnival people ... to come here and give this show for the children .
They 're having the time of their lives !
Why aren 't you down in the yard with the rest of the children ?
I wanna stay up here .
The circus people have been kind enough to give a special show for us .
- It 'll be starting in a few minutes .
- I don 't care .
The yard 's full of clowns and jugglers and acrobats .
Bet there 's a cage full of wild animals .
I hope they run loose and kill a few people .
There 's a golden chariot and performing pigs ... and the fattest woman in the world and the tallest man .
I 'm sure you 'd have an awfully good time .
How can you have a good time when your heart 's breaking ?
- Hearts do not break .
- That 's all you know about it .
I take it , then , you don 't intend to come down .
No , I swore I 'd never leave this room till they carried me out dead !
Well , good-bye then .
Every time it rains it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don 't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
Now listen .
I know you got other things to think about ... but can 't you find some way to get me out of here ?
Can 't you think of something ?
- Be sure that your umbrella
- Can 't you ...
Is upside down
Get yourself a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
One , two Button your shoe
Put on your coat and hat
I play a game like that
While I 'm waiting for you
Three , four Open the door
Hurry , for heaven 's sake
I count each step you take
While I 'm waiting for you
Five , six , my heart does tricks as I picture all your charms
Seven , eight You 're at the gate
And you walk into my arms
Oh , nine , ten Kiss me again
Tell me you get a thrill
Just as I hope you will
While I 'm waiting for you
One , two Button up your shoe
Put on your coat and your hat
I play a game like that
While I 'm waiting for you
Three , four , open the door
Now hurry , dear Hurry , for heaven 's sake
I count each step you take
While I 'm waitin 'for you
Oh , five , six
Now my heart does tricks as I picture all your charms
Seven , eight You 're at the gate
And you make me dizzy when you 're walking right into my arms
Nine , ten , kiss me again
Tell me you get such a thrill
Just as I hope you will while I 'm waitin 'for you
- Hi . Now , here 's the plan .
- What plan ?
- You 're checking out of here .
- Larry !
And I thought she was kiddin ' .
- Who was kidding ?
- Susan Sprague .
She promised she 'd get me out of here .
Get you out of here ?
If it wasn 't for her , you wouldn 't be here .
That female Iscariot framed you the moment I turned my back .
That 's what I thought .
But she said she didn 't have anything to do with it .
- She even lost her job because of us .
- How do you know ?
She was in to see me , and she told me .
- And she said that she ... Oh .
Oh .
- Well , what did she say ?
Well , she made me promise not to tell a living soul , especially you .
- Tell me !
Tell me now !
- Oh , it 's nothing important .
It 's a secret .
Do you want me to break my word ?
I 'll break your neck if you don 't tell me .
Come on .
Well , she said she liked you ... a lot , an awful lot .
She says the first time she saw you , she fell in love with you .
And the more she saw you the worse it got .
- And she said that ...
- Now listen .
If you 're lying to me , I 'm gonna let you stay in this place till you 're 108 !
Oh , but I 'm not lying , Larry .
I 'd never tell a lie .
Now look , here 's what we 're gonna do .
She ate too much spinach .
Come here .
Come on .
Make it fast . Come on !
Five , six ... seven , eight ... nine , ten .
That 's the man .
Susan Sprague 's in New York , and that 's the place to find Larry Poole .
Come in .
- Miss Sprague ?
- Yes .
- We 're from the police department .
- What can I do for you ?
Now don 't be alarmed .
We just came up to get a little information .
- What about ?
- We 're trying to find a Larry Poole .
Well , what makes you think that I know his whereabouts ?
The last thing he said before he left was that he was gonna look for you .
What do you want him for ?
What are the charges against him ?
Who said there was a charge ?
We wanna have a few words with the man , that 's all .
I suppose that anything I say will be used against me .
Not at all .
We got nothin ' on you .
It 's Larry Poole we 're after .
All you 've got to do is tell us where he is .
Well , to the best of my information and belief , Mr. Poole is in ...
- Venice .
- Venice ?
That 's in Italy .
Come in .
- Here 's your laundry .
- Thanks .
What 's that ?
That 's a map of New York City .
What are all those little pins for ?
Oh , that 's a long story .
I 've got plenty of time .
Well , each one of those little pins represents a backyard .
I 'm making sort of a tour of all the backyards in New York City .
- What for ?
- I 'm looking for somebody .
- Are you a G-man ?
- No .
- Who are you looking for ?
- A girl .
- When you find her , what 'll you do ?
- Do you have to know ?
But I 'd like to know . You 've got me all excited .
Listen , if I tell you , will you keep it to yourself ?
Oh , sure .
If I find that girl , I 'm going to get down on my knees ... and apologize to her for being such a fool ... as to misunderstand her for even a moment .
I 'm going to ask her to forgive me .
If you 'll excuse me , I 've got a lot of backyards to cover today .
The breeze runs after you
When you 're passing by
It wants to be near
And so do I
The willow bows to you
Forgetting to cry
It waits for your smile
And so do I
All the world 's at your command
What wouldn 't it do
For one look at you
And I 'm
That way too
The rose that you caress
Is willing to die
It loves you so very much
And so
Do I
Oh , am I glad I found you .
- You know I was down to my last pin ?
- What pin ?
Wait till I get my breath .
Well , go ahead .
Slap my face .
It was worth it .
Oh , don 't be silly .
- I 've been looking all over for you .
- You 've been looking for me ?
Gee , I 've been looking for you for weeks .
Why , I even put an ad in the personal column .
Larry , you shouldn 't be here . The police are looking for you .
- You 've got to leave town .
- Leave town is right .
I 'm on a hunger strike ! I 'm not going to eat !
I 'm on a hunger strike !
I 've lost three pounds in the last two days , and I 'll be dead soon !
She 's perfectly capable of carrying out her threats .
Mr. Carmichael , I 've got my own health to consider .
I 'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown .
So they found you , Poole .
Yeah , I decided to come on back and take my medicine .
Patricia , come back here .
- No . - See ?
That 's what I get all the time .
Now , I want this matter settled here and now .
You 've got to take this demon out of my institution .
She 's disrupted the discipline , tried to set fire to the place ... smashed the furniture , broken the windows ... and now it 's a hunger strike .
And if I don 't die of hunger , I 'm gonna jump out of the window .
I 've written a letter blaming everything on you ... and I 'm going to mail it to all the newspapers before I kill myself !
You see !
You 've got to do something about this ... even if you have to adopt her yourself .
Me ?
I 'd rather resign my job .
Young man ... you said you were ready to take your medicine .
It may prove to be bitter medicine , but you 've got to help me out .
- Help you out ?
- Yes , with this brat .
We 've had nothing but trouble ever since we sent her to the orphanage .
Shortly after she came there , carnival people put on a show for the children .
She tore open the bass drum and tried to escape in it .
Since then , she 's made life miserable for everybody .
She refuses to go with anybody but you .
- Couldn 't you take her off our hands ?
- Well ... Huh ?
You mean to say that 's why you had those cops bring me here ?
I 'm terribly sorry , but you see the desperate situation I 'm in .
You 're the only one in the world who can help .
And there was no other way of finding you .
Well , I guess you boys know the penalties for false arrest .
Who said you were under arrest ?
We were told to find you and bring you here , and we did it .
First , you do everything to put this child in an orphanage , and I 'm the goat .
Now you 're doing everything under the sun to have her ... taken out of the orphanage , and I 'm still the goat .
Looks to me like I 'm " Joe Goat " around here . Why should I do anything for you ?
It isn 't for me .
I 'm only acting in the best interest of Patricia here ... this poor little motherless child .
Well , Susan , what do you think ?
First of all , I think Mr. Carmichael owes you an apology .
I do , and I apologize most humbly .
- And you owe Miss Sprague an apology .
- I do .
- Hey , what about me ?
- Shut up !
And then I think Patsy should be adopted by a respectable married couple .
Well , what 's the matter with us ?
Aren 't we respectable ?
Yeah , what 's the matter with them ?
Oh , let 's eat .
I 'm just dying of hunger .
Say good-bye to the nice man .
G ...
Oh . No , never mind .
When I 'm waitin 'for you
Three , four Open up the door
Now hurry , dear Hurry , for heaven 's sake
I count each step you take when I 'm waiting for you
Five , six , now my heart does tricks as I picture all your charms
Seven , eight You 're at the gate
And you make me dizzy when you 're walking right into my arms
Nine , ten , kiss me again
Tell me you get such a thrill
Just as I hope you will
When I 'm waiting for you
Hey , hey , hey !
Look out there !
Hey , hey !
Look out !
Look out !
How about some water ?
There it is .
There 's the can .
Help yourself .
The sign 's right .
Your last chance .
You better fill up .
Okay , fill her up .
Boze .
Hey , Boze !
Boze !
Boze !
- Man wants gas .
Get going .
- Okay , boss .
Everybody 's entitled to their own way of thinking .
- You fellas want more coffee ?
- Yeah .
I don 't know why , Nick , but you 're always squawking .
I got a right to .
What do I do ?
I climb poles to put up wires so that some broker in New York ... ... can call some guy in Los Angeles and tell him he 's been wiped out .
We 're not pioneering .
We 're repairing .
Friend , when you talk about pioneering , you 're talking about something ... - ... I can tell you a few things about .
- Shut up , Gramp .
- l don 't want to shut up .
- Don 't argue with the guests .
Listen , I can tell these boys some things they 'd like to hear , wouldn 't you , boys ?
- Sure .
- Go ahead . Change the subject .
Listen , I come down into this desert 56 years ago .
Come from Virginia City .
You had to be tough to cross this country in them days .
Why , I helped string the first wire that run west out of Albuquerque .
Yes , sir .
Say , are you the fella that took a shot at Billy the Kid ?
I never took no shot at Billy the Kid .
No .
I had too darned much sense .
He took a couple of shots at me , though .
I 'm practically the only man he ever missed .
Well , he was-
- He was only fooling , so it couldn 't hardly count .
Okay , pop !
Say , I wanted to tell you .
Do you know the first message that was sent over that wire ?
It said- - lt said , " God save the republic . "
You 'd better send that message again , pop .
The republic 's in bad need of saving .
That 'll be 55 cents apiece .
Fine excuse for a republic we got .
Fine excuse for law and order .
You read about that gangster massacre in Oklahoma City ?
Now , there 's an example .
Our government 's nothing but a gangster 's joke .
There 's one remark I 'll pass to you , brother :
Be careful how you talk about the United States of America .
- Come on , Nick .
- Wait a minute .
- Let me get a load of this tinhorn patriot .
- You got your eats .
There 's your change .
Now kindly get out .
Thought you said not to argue with the guests .
- You better tend to your own business- -
- My own business .
What business ?
Miserable little service station on the edge of nowhere .
Well , maybe that 's all you 're good for .
What chance have I ever had to prove what I can do ?
You had a war , didn 't you ?
The biggest war yet .
I bet you think I failed because I didn 't come home with any medals .
You didn 't have to drive behind the lines .
I enlisted where my mechanical knowledge would do the most good .
- Paula 's scared .
- Scared of what ?
Duke Mantee and his gang are headed this way .
Nobody will get Mantee .
He 'll fool them .
You can 't fool all the people all the time .
- Watch things , Gabby. I 'll get dressed .
- What for ?
The Black Horse Vigilante meeting .
Dad , aren 't you ever gonna get tired of playing soldier ?
Well , that bandit gang better not head this way .
What 'll you do , blow the bugle and turn the whole potbellied troop loose on them ?
I only hope someday my own daughter ... ... will learn to respect the things I stand for .
There 's the mail !
There 's the mail .
Hello , Dick .
How 's everything ?
Oh , not so good .
They tell me Mantee and his gang are around here someplace .
Yeah ?
What 's he- - ?
Paula was right .
The postman just told me ... ... that Duke Mantee and his gang are gallivanting around here someplace .
Cut it out .
- What 's the matter ?
Don 't you like me ?
- No , not very much .
Well , I 'll forgive you since I haven 't had much chance to go into my act .
But when I do , you 're gonna change your attitude plenty fast .
- What 's that you 're reading ?
- Oh , you wouldn 't like it .
Oh , poetry .
Say , that 's pretty hot .
Well ?
I 've suspected all along all you needed was a little encouragement .
- That 's great poetry .
- Sure , it 's great .
But I can think of something a whole lot better .
- l 'm not so terrible-looking , am I ?
- You think a lot of yourself , don 't you ?
- lt 's easy to tell when a girl wants love .
- ls it ?
Sure .
- How can you tell that , Boze ?
- Well ... ... one way is when she calls you by your whole name for the first time .
And another way is the way I feel .
It takes two to make a radio program .
The one that 's sending and the one that 's receiving .
When I 'm with a girl that 's cute and appealing with big , blue eyes ... ... and I feel electric waves running through me ... ... I can be pretty sure she 's the one doing the sending , whether she knows it or not .
Have you a radio program coming in right now ?
It 's like the hottest torch song that was ever sung .
Can 't you hear it , honey ?
You can call me a sap if you want to , but I 'm falling in love with you .
I 'm getting to want you more than is good for me .
- Boze , have you ever been in love before ?
- No .
- Have you ever said you were ?
- Sure , plenty of times .
- Did they believe you ?
- Certainly , and I 'll tell you why .
Because they 're all dumb .
That 's where you 're different , Gabby .
- l couldn 't fool you .
- l 'm smart , am I ?
Too smart for most men , you 'd catch onto them .
But that 's what I want .
The better you know me , the more you 'll like me .
You 'd better look out if you want to keep your job .
Dad doesn 't like having the hired help make passes at me .
You 're gonna love me , Gabby .
Love me a lot .
Look out .
Here 's someone coming .
Good evening .
Could I ... ... order something to eat ?
Why , certainly .
Miss Maple will be glad to take care of you .
Thank you .
Wait a minute .
is your dad going to town ?
Why , yes .
Okay .
Will you sit down , sir ?
Thank you .
- Do you live around here ?
- No .
No , a tourist afoot .
My last host of the road dropped me about 1 0 miles back .
Still , it 's wonderful what progress you can make just by doing this :
Thanks .
" Today 's special . "
Tell me , just what is a " Bar-B-Q " ?
Well , here it 's a hamburger sandwich with some vegetables on the side .
It 's always today 's special .
- lt 's pretty good .
- lt is ?
Unless we have a sandstorm .
Well , I 'll have it .
First of all , I 'd like some cream of corn soup , some beer ...
- ... and I 'll order the dessert later .
- Okay .
Thank-
- Oh , another question .
Where am I ?
Well , this place is called Black Mesa .
Black Mesa .
How intriguing .
Where are you planning to go ?
My plans have been uncertain .
Oh , just hoboing along .
Call it " gypsy-ing . "
I had a vague idea I 'd like to see the Pacific Ocean ... ... or perhaps drown in it . But that depends .
Where did you come from ?
Quite a long way , Miss Maple .
- That is the name , isn 't it ?
- Yes , that 's it .
- Are you English ?
- No .
You might call me an American once removed .
- But if you wouldn 't mind- -
- The soup will be in in a minute .
The washroom is through that door if you want it .
Thank you .
- Oh , good evening .
- Good evening .
- Anyone take your order ?
- Yes , a charming young lady .
That 's my daughter .
- Gee willikers , ain 't that great ?
Look .
- Ain 't what great ?
Duke Mantee and his gang are around here someplace .
- There 's his picture .
- lf he heads this way ... ... we Black Horse Vigilantes will handle that gent .
- You would ?
- Of course .
That 's what we 're for .
If you 'd take my advice , I wouldn 't start any shooting in that getup .
- Why not ?
- l never see 'd a better target .
Yeah ?
Well , you needn 't be afraid about me .
Afraid ?
I ain 't afraid .
But I would be if I was you .
- l took 5 bucks , Gabby .
- Why 'd you need all that for ?
Just in case of emergency .
Say , between the two of you ... ... you 'd think I wasn 't fit to be trusted with money , ideas or anything .
Well , let me tell you , the both of you , that I 've ... .
Oh , well .
- Gramp ?
- Yes ?
Gramp , what are you doing back there ?
Can 't you let your old grandpappy have a little snifter now ?
No .
You can have one before you go to bed .
Well , I 'm sleepy now .
Gramp .
- Your soup is ready , my friend .
- Oh , thanks .
- lt looks good too .
- Thank you .
Look out , look out .
That 's The Denver Post .
Here you are .
- Thanks .
- Yeah .
Oh , say , look .
Look , look .
There 's a picture of Duke Mantee .
" Six killed . "
- Did he do all that ?
- Oh , yes .
Yes , indeed .
- He doesn 't look very vicious , does he ?
- l tell you here .
You can 't tell a killer except by his chin .
There 's a funny thing about that .
A killer always holds his chin in .
You ever notice that ?
- l don 't think I 've ever seen a killer .
- Oh , I have .
Plenty of them .
- You ever hear tell of Billy the Kid ?
- Yes .
My soup 's getting cold .
I knowed him down in the Pecos Country .
He took a couple of shots at me once .
Well , congratulations .
I mean , on still being with us .
Hey !
But I don 't think you understand .
You see , it was kind of dark ... ... and the Kid had had a few ... ... and I think he was just trying to scare the pants off of me .
- Did he do it ?
- No .
No , no .
I see 'd he was just a-funning , and so I said to him , I said :
" Kid , you 're drunk . " And he said to me :
" Well , what makes you think that ? " And I said , " Because you missed me . "
Well , you ought to heard him laugh .
Say , you 're kind of hungry , ain 't you ?
Well , you can go just so long without food .
What line of work you in ?
None at the moment .
I had been a writer .
- A writer ?
- Yes .
- Well , that 's a funny thing .
- Yes , it is .
- l knew the greatest writer ever .
- Really ?
Sam Clemens .
Ever hear of him ?
Well , now , let me see .
Sam- -
- Did you ever hear of Mark Twain ?
- Yes .
- Well , that 's the same feller .
- Oh , that 's right .
I knowed him well when I was a boy back in Virginia City .
Yeah , he used to write funny things for the paper there , the Enterprise .
Yes , sir .
Yes , he used to write , he said , on the principle ... ... that people that read his writings didn 't want the truth ... ... so that 's what he 's gonna give them .
- Are you a famous writer ?
- No , no. I 'm-
- No .
Oh , you 're just modest about it ?
What 's your name ?
Alan Squier .
- Your supper 's ready , Gramp .
- And I 'm ready for it too .
Watching this feller eat made me hungry .
Well , I 'm glad to know you , Mr. Squier .
- Glad to have met you , sir . - Yes , sir .
Thank you , sir .
- Like the soup ?
- Oh , it was glorious .
Did I hear you say that you were a writer ?
Yes. ln a way .
I 've never known any writers .
- Please don 't go .
- Do you want something else ?
No , I just wanted to talk to you .
Won 't you please sit down ?
All right .
I suppose you want to go into the movies .
Not on your life .
I want to go to Bourges .
- Where ?
- Bourges , in France .
You might never guess it , but that 's where l came from .
- Really ?
You 're not French , are you ?
- Partly. I was born in Bourges .
I left there before I was hardly able to walk ... ... so all I know about it is from postcards my mother sends me .
They got a cathedral there .
- Your mother still lives there ?
Dad brought us here after the war .
Mother stuck it out for years ... ... then packed and went back to Bourges .
We 've never seen her since .
Some people think it was cruel of her to leave me , but what could she do ?
She had no money , and she couldn 't live here .
You can 't blame her for that .
Do you think it was cruel of her ?
- No , not if you don 't , Miss Maple .
- Look .
Look , here 's a picture of Mother just before she married Dad .
She 's lovely , isn 't she ?
- You know , I can see the resemblance .
- Can you really ?
It 's hard to imagine her being married to Dad .
Still , I suppose , he looked all right in his American uniform .
Mother always gives me a book on my birthday .
She sent me this one .
- Ever read them ?
- Yes , I have .
It 's swell poetry .
Mother 's written on the flyleaf .
- lt means , " To my dear little Gabrielle . "
- Oh , it does ?
Gabrielle , that 's a beautiful name .
Wouldn 't you know it 'd get changed into " Gabby " ... ... by these sunbaked , ignorant desert rats .
I see you share your mother 's opinion of the desert .
Yes , it takes the stink of the gasoline and the hamburger out of my system .
Gabrielle , would you like to read me one of those poems ?
- Right now ?
- Yes . While I 'm finishing today 's special .
Okay , I 'll read you the one I like the best .
Such good I wish you
Yea , and heartily I 'm fired with hope Of true love 's meed to get
Knowing love writes it in his book
For why , this is the end For which we twain are met
Go on , Gabrielle .
Seeing reason wills not That I cast love by
Nor here with reason Shall I chide and fret
Nor cease to serve But serve more constantly
This is the end For which we twain are met
You know ... .
You know , that guy writes wonderful stuff .
How did you pronounce his name ?
The French seem to understand everything .
That 's why you want to go to France ?
- For understanding ? - l will go there .
When Gramp dies ... ... we 're gonna sell this place , and I 'll take my money and go to Bourges ... ... and find something , well , something beautiful to look at ...
Well , if I were you , Gabrielle , I 'd stay here and avoid disappointment .
I 've been to France .
- What were you doing , writing books ?
- No , planning to write books .
You see , I married a lady of wealth .
She was very liberal to me .
Don 't think ill of me because of that .
I actually did write a book .
What kind of a book ?
Fiction ?
In a sense , yes. lt was a novel. I was 22 at the time. lt was very , very stark .
It sold slightly over 600 copies. lt cost the publisher a great deal of money .
And incidentally , it cost him his wife .
You see , she divorced him and married me .
She saw in me a major artist .
Profound but inarticulate .
She thought I needed background , so she gave it to me with southern exposure ... ... and a fine view of the Mediterranean .
Well , for eight years I reclined there , on the Riviera , on my background ... ... and I waited for the major artist to emerge ... ... and say something of enduring importance .
But he preferred to remain inarticulate .
- And you 've left your wife now ?
- Yes .
That 's swell .
I left her at her suggestion .
See , she 'd taken up with a Brazilian painter , also a major artist .
There was nothing left to do but travel .
I decided to set forth and discover America .
And I 've come this far on my journey ... ... thanks to the power of the thumb .
What are you looking for ?
I don 't know .
I suppose I was looking for something to believe in , worth living for and dying for .
What have you found ?
Nothing half so interesting as an old man who was missed by Billy the Kid ... ... and a fair young lady who reads Villon .
Well , I do other things that 'd surprise you .
- Yes , I 'm sure you do .
- l paint pictures .
- No .
Any good ?
- Nope .
- Let me see them .
- They 're kind of crazy .
Well , so much the better .
Please let me see them .
Perhaps you 're a genius and I 'm to introduce you to posterity .
- You 're not kidding me ?
- No , Gabrielle .
I 've never kidded anybody , outside of myself .
Well , all right. lf you 'll promise not to tell anybody about them .
I give you my word of honor .
- You got to climb a ladder to see .
- Come on .
Give me some water and gas .
Right .
That 's Paula , our Mexican cook .
It isn 't much of a likeness .
I 'm sure it wasn 't intended to be photographic .
That 's the one that I like the best .
I wanted to show how the clouds look when they roll down the mountains .
Gabrielle , tell me , what on earth made you paint in that strange manner ?
Oh , it 's just how I see and feel .
Oh , yes .
Are they any good ?
I tell you , Gabrielle , I can say I 'm tremendously impressed .
I could improve if I could get to France .
They have marvelous art schools there .
Do you realize there are thousands of artists in France saying :
" lf only I could get to Arizona " ?
I know .
A lot of people go crazy about this desert when they see it .
They seem to think it 's full of mystery and haunted and all that .
- Well , so it is .
- Well , maybe it is ... ... but there 's something in me that wants something different .
I know there 's something in you .
Wish I could figure out what it is .
Maybe it 's the French in my blood .
You know , sometimes I feel as if I was sparkling all over ... ... and I wanna go out and do something absolutely crazy and marvelous .
Then the American part of me speaks up and spoils everything .
And I go back to work and figure out my dull accounts .
So much coffee , so many rolls ... ... so many hamburgers , sugar .
Do you keep the accounts correctly ?
If I didn 't , we 'd go broke .
Well , that 's the French part of you .
- Would you like to marry a Frenchman ?
- l don 't wanna marry .
- No ? - l wanna be always free .
I see .
How about that stalwart youth down there in the football jersey ?
What makes you think I 'd take notice of him ?
- l don 't know .
When I came in just now- -
- Sure , I know .
He was kissing me .
- That 's nothing .
- There 's always room for development .
- He 's after me , all right .
- He is ?
- Think he 'll succeed ?
- l haven 't decided yet .
- What 's your advice ?
- Oh , no . Don 't ask me , Gabrielle .
Let your French blood guide you .
It 's infallible in those matters .
- You ought to know something .
- l don 't know anything .
The trouble with me is I belong to a vanishing race .
I am one of the intellectuals .
That means you got brains .
Yeah , brains without purpose .
Noise without sound , shape without substance .
Have you ever read " The Hollow Men " ?
Don 't .
Very discouraging because it 's true .
It refers to intellectuals who thought they 'd conquered nature , dammed it ...
Built streamlined monstrosities to penetrate its resistance .
They wrapped it up in cellophane , sold it in drugstores .
They were so certain they had it subdued , and now ... .
Do you realize what it is that 's causing world chaos ?
You don 't ?
Well , I 'm probably the only living man who can tell you .
It 's nature hitting back .
She 's fighting with new instruments called neuroses .
She 's deliberately afflicting mankind with the jitters .
Nature 's proving she can 't be beaten , not by the likes of us .
She 's taking the world away from the intellectuals ... ... and giving it back to the apes .
Well , forgive me , Gabrielle .
It 's such a luxury to have somebody to talk to .
Don 't you pay any attention to me .
I was born in 1 901 , the year Victoria died .
I was just too late for the Great War and too soon for the new order .
You may be a new species , for all I know .
You can be one of nature 's children ... ... therefore able to understand her and enjoy her , depending upon how you feel .
Only you can decide whether or not to yield ... ... to the ardors of number 42 out there .
You know , you talk like a darn fool .
I know it. I know it .
It 's no wonder your wife kicked you out .
But it 's no wonder she fell for you first .
- That sounds like a compliment .
- lt is a compliment .
Thanks .
- What did you say your name was ?
- Alan Squier .
But I 've been calling you Gabrielle , so you 'd better call me Alan .
All right , Alan .
Petrified Forest is dead trees in the desert that turned to stone .
Here 's a good specimen .
So that was once a tree .
Petrified Forest ?
A suitable haven for me .
Perhaps that 's what I 'm destined to become ... ... an interesting fossil for future study .
I 'd like to see France with you .
Oh , no , Gabrielle , I never could retrace my footsteps .
- Haven 't you got enough money ?
- Well ... ... even that is an understatement .
I haven 't either , but I can do this as well as you can .
I 'm afraid we 'd reach a point on the Atlantic coast ... ... where even that gesture would be unavailing .
There 's something appealing about you .
Appealing ?
That 's been my downfall .
Do you know how much money Gramps has in the bank at Santa Fe ?
$ 22,000 in liberty bonds , and it 's all willed to me .
- l guess we could go pretty far on that .
- Oh , too far .
And then when we got to France , why , you could show me everything .
That 's a startling proposal. I didn 't expect to receive anything like that in this desert .
Oh , we 'd have to wait , maybe years , but I could get Boze fired ... - ... and give you the gas-station job .
- You 'd like me for a companion ?
I know I would .
And I don 't make many mistakes .
You 're no ape-man , Alan , but you 're lovable .
Lovable ?
The next grade below appealing .
Wouldn 't you like someone to be in love with you ?
Yes , Gabrielle , I would like someone in love with me .
Do you think I 'm attractive ?
There are better words than that for what you are .
Then why not stay here ?
You have nothing better to do .
That 's the trouble . You 'd get tired of a man ... ... who had nothing to do but worship you .
That 's a dull kind of love , Gabrielle .
It 's the kind of love that makes people old too soon .
But I thank you for the suggestion .
It 's opened up a new channel in my imagination ... ... which it 'll be interesting to explore during my lonely wanderings .
You 're going now ?
- Yes , I 'm going .
- Well , I guess I can 't stop you .
No , Gabrielle ... ... you can 't stop me .
But you could do me one great favor before I go .
Would you mind very much if I kissed you goodbye ?
- No , I wouldn 't mind .
- You 'd understand it would be ... .
Yes , I understand .
Just a kiss , that 's all .
Yes .
That 's absolutely all .
So that 's what you 've been doing .
Necking , eh ?
- Who do you think you are ?
- Lay off him , Boze .
She 's cute , so you thought you could get fresh .
Oh , no .
He was just kissing me goodbye .
Yes , I admit the impulse is a little hard to explain .
Don 't bother to explain .
Just pay your check and get out .
Yes .
Well , how much do I owe , Miss Maple ?
- Thirty cents .
- What do you mean , 30 cents ?
- ls that all he ate ?
- Shut up , Boze .
Thirty cents ?
For all that ?
That 's very reasonable .
Very reasonable .
But that brings us to another embarrassment .
I haven 't got 30 cents .
Frankly , I haven 't anything .
- What have you got in this pack ?
- Nothing .
Shirts , socks , underwear ... ... toothbrush , passport , insurance policy ... ... and a copy of Modern Man in Search of a Soul by- -
You ought to read that .
You 'd love it .
You were gonna pay with a kiss ?
Take your hands off him .
Go on , Alan .
- All right , I 'm leaving .
- l 'll give him a head start .
Sorry , ma 'am .
- Where 's the restroom , please ?
- Through that door at the right .
- Gas and oil , please . - Get on the job , Boze .
Boze .
- Gas and oil .
- Have you any good cigars ?
Yes , sir .
Right over here , sir .
What have you ?
Well , I have some stogies and some Arizona Pips .
Let me see the Pips .
- How far to the Phoenix Palace Hotel ?
- Well , it 's a good 200 miles from here .
- Goodbye , Miss Maple .
- Wait a minute , Alan .
- Excuse me , sir .
- What ?
Have you room for another person in your car ?
- Who is it ?
- A friend of mine , Mr. Squier .
He 's on his way to the coast and hasn 't got a car right now .
He 's an author .
- Joseph ?
- Yes , sir .
Do you think we can give this man a lift as far as the Phoenix Palace Hotel ?
- l guess he 's all right , Mr. Chisholm .
- Very well .
Glad to have you along .
Thank you , Mr. Chisholm .
And thank you , Miss Maple .
I shall remember your kindness .
- l forgot to give you your change .
- What cha- - ?
But I wanted you to keep that .
But tipping is un-American . We don 't allow it .
Here .
Here , take it .
- l can 't pretend that l- -
- When you get to the coast ... ... send a postcard with a view of the Pacific Ocean .
I like pictures of the sea .
Oh , my dear , come here .
- This is Mr ... .
- Mr .
Squier .
Mr. Squier , darling. I 've offered him a lift as far as the Phoenix Palace Hotel .
Now , he 's quite all right .
Joseph just went over him .
- How do you do , Mrs. Chisholm ?
- How do you do ?
Well , are we ready to start ?
Yes , very well .
Come along , Mr. Squier .
Well , I suppose I shall never see you again .
No .
That 's the way it is in a gas station .
They come and they go .
But somehow or another I 'll manage to repay this dollar .
Goodness knows when .
Perhaps we 'll run into each other someday in Bourges .
Yes .
- Well , goodbye , Gabrielle .
- Goodbye , Alan .
Oh , Joseph , will you turn on the radio ?
Flash , latest bulletin on Mantee Massacre in Oklahoma City .
Following is the description of Mantee 's car heading for the border .
Watch for this car :
Oklahoma license number 3T-808 .
Front right fender heavily dented .
Bullet holes in rear window of car .
The car is supplied with extra gasoline .
Three of the gangsters are believed to be accompanying Mantee , the leader .
Mantee 's description follows :
- Straight , black hair ... .
- Kill that radio , Ruby .
- Can 't you fix it , Slim ?
- No , the cylinder head 's cracked .
What are you talking about ?
Wait a minute .
Get behind that rock , Jackie .
You two , behind that car .
Keep out of sight .
Come on , step out , brother .
Hop out of that car and nobody gets hurt .
Shut up , lady .
Come on , hop out . Get over there .
Come on , hurry it up . Hurry it up .
- Friends of yours ?
- For years I 've wondered ...
... what you 'd do in this situation , and what did you do ?
Nothing .
Correct , my dear idiot wife. I did nothing because that man is Duke Mantee .
- No , really ?
- Yes .
Joseph , let us see if their car will function .
Yes , Mr. Chisholm .
Sweetheart .
Want a piece of gum ?
From the way you act , you 'd think you were crazy about that guy .
I 'm not crazy about him , but every once in a while you meet somebody ... - ... that 's a natural object of charity .
- Yeah , but he 's gone. I 'm here .
Listen , honey , let 's take a little walk around the mesa .
Sun 's going down .
How about it , sweetheart ?
- Do you know what he said , Boze ?
- What ?
That we 'd been fighting nature , and we thought we 'd licked it .
But that 's where we 're wrong .
We 've got to admit that nature can 't be beaten .
Yeah , I heard all that .
But isn 't that what I 've been telling you all along ?
I guess so , Boze .
Well , how about the walk , sweetheart ?
I 'll think about it .
I 'll get rid of them fast .
Now , just behave yourself , you two , and nobody will get hurt .
This is Duke Mantee , the world-famous killer .
And he 's hungry .
Alan !
- What are you doing here ?
- There 's bandits here .
- Yeah , so we heard .
- Yes , they made us stop and get out .
Then they drove off in Mr. Chisholm 's car .
- Their car was locked- -
- Alan , look out .
Come here .
Well , so we meet again .
Sit down , pal .
Down there .
Yeah , I 'd be delighted .
Wait a minute .
Sit down , you !
Would you mind sitting down over there , pop ?
Sure .
Sure .
Up there , Fat .
Football player , eh ?
Yeah , and you better not let me get close enough to take a sock at you .
I used to be quite a fan .
What 's your school ?
Molby Tech .
Never heard of it .
Ruby , get down by the door and keep your eyes open .
- You got Slim watching on the outside .
- Get down to the door .
Hey , Squier , that 's Duke Mantee .
Remember ?
- l showed you his picture , remember ?
- Yes , I remember .
Join us in a glass of beer ?
Thanks .
Do you mind if I have some of that whiskey instead ?
Give him a drink , sister .
Jackie , turn on that radio in back of you .
What 'd I tell you ?
Look at that chin .
He 's a killer , all right .
- We 're lucky we got ringside seats .
- He 's a gangster and a rat .
He ain 't no gangster .
He 's a real old-time desperado .
Gangsters is foreigners , and he 's an American .
Wait till the sheriff finds out he 's here . We 'll see some real killing .
Won 't we , Duke ?
The cops ain 't likely to catch up with us .
Not tonight .
So we can all be quiet and peaceable and have a few beers together ... ... and listen to the music .
And not make any wrong moves .
I may as well tell you that Ruby there with the gun ... ... he 's pretty nervous and jumpy .
And he 's got the itch between his fingers .
So let 's everybody stay where they are .
Let there be killing .
All this evening , I 've had a feeling of destiny closing in .
Do you believe in astrology ?
I couldn 't say , pal .
Well , I don 't normally .
But tonight , as I was walking along that road ... ... I began to feel the enchantment of this desert .
I looked up at the sky , and the stars seemed to be mocking me , reproving me .
They were pointing the way to that gleaming sign and saying :
" There 's the end of your tether .
You thought you could escape and skip off to the Phoenix Palace ... ... but we know better . "
That 's what the stars told me .
For perhaps they know that carnage is imminent .
And that I 'm due to be among the fallen .
Fascinating thought .
Let 's skip it .
Here 's happy days .
Yes , sir .
Certainly does feel great to have a real killer around here again .
Yes , it 's pleasant to be back again amongst the living .
Hooray .
Oh , come on , Joseph .
Hurry , please .
I 'm doing the best I can , Mrs. Chisholm .
Well , why don 't you start it ?
- Well , if you think you can do better- -
- Well , I couldn 't do worse .
Hey , good luck , Duke .
Good thing you showed up , or I wouldn 't have got this .
Well , what happened to Andy Anderson then ?
Oh , I 'll tell you .
He sneaked into the Civil War .
- Did he ?
- Yes .
He told me it was a regular paradise for killing .
He 'd stick a Johnny Reb with his bayonet and toss him over his shoulder- -
Say , pop. I wish you wouldn 't talk so much about blood while we 're eating .
What , you got it on your conscience ?
- On my what ?
- Yeah , I thought so .
A yap like you hasn 't got any more conscience than a coyote .
Listen to the halfback .
How much did you get for playing on the team ?
I worked my way through college .
Oh , how nice .
Wait a minute , smart guy . I have something to show you .
Keep your hand off your hip .
I was gonna show him a clipping that said I should 've been all-American .
Scared you , didn 't I ?
I knew it , you 're all yellow .
I 'd be a little tactful if I were you .
They 're your guests .
They 're yellow dogs .
That 's why they turned crooked .
No , no , no .
Cowardice isn 't the cause of crime , is it ?
It has to do with the glands .
They can 't face the problems of life .
They got to fight their way through with guns instead of with principles .
Step over to the other side of the room , halfback .
You gonna kill him ?
- You see ?
That 's just what I said .
- This bullet will go right through you .
And you wouldn 't want me to hurt the cute , little dame .
You 're taking this much too seriously , you know .
- l 'm not afraid to die .
- Come on , move !
Step up that radio , will you , sister .
- Sit down , Jackie Cooper .
- Come on , listen .
- You heard what he said to me .
- Sit down .
You too .
Latest bulletins on the greatest manhunt in history .
Mantee 's headed for the border .
The greatest patrol in history formed ... - ... from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific .
- Take a bow .
They escaped in two cars , one containing Mantee and three men .
The other car containing three men and one woman .
The Mantee car was seen an hour ago headed west .
The second car has been lost track of .
- How did they do it with Doris along- - ?
- Shut up .
- -New Mexico and Arizona .
You know how the officers of the law are in this region :
Shoot first , ask questions afterwards .
Watch for this car :
Oklahoma license number 3T-808 .
Stand by for further details .
Now , some football scores .
- Turn it down , sister .
- Molby Tech- -
Ruby ... ... go out to the car and tell Slim to come get his supper .
Tell him to bring in that sack of smoke and the road map .
You stay there and keep awake .
Gabrielle , there wasn 't much whiskey .
Could we have more ?
Who told you you could call her by her first name ?
Now , Boze , you and I have got to be friends , so long as they let us .
Why don 't you take a sock at him , halfback .
Hi , everybody .
It 's about time you got around to asking me in .
Here 's your map , boss .
When we gonna feed my stomach ?
Cook him some hamburger , Fat .
Go with her , Slim .
Okay , boss .
When we gonna lam out of here ?
Just as soon as Duke connects with his heavy date .
I don 't like that dame stuff .
I likes to get out of range .
- How about passing that ?
- Certainly .
- No .
You 've had all you 're gonna get .
- Sorry , Gramp .
Oh , it 's all right .
- What are you doing , Gramp ?
- l 'm gonna smoke my pipe .
Go ahead , pop .
Thanks , Duke .
How are you gonna pay for all that liquor ?
I can pay , Boze , and I will .
I have a dollar .
- Oh , you have ?
So you were holding out ?
- No , no , no. I acquired it since then .
- Where ?
- Perhaps the rich people gave it to him .
Now , lay off , Boze .
If you must know , I 'll tell you the extent of my pride .
- Gabrielle gave me the dollar .
- You did ?
It 's none of your business .
Oh , you were feeling kind of generous tonight , weren 't you ?
Would you like to know what she was gonna give me when those rats came ?
Well , speaking of rats !
Of all the low , slimy , stinking- -
No , Gabrielle , no .
You mustn 't blame Boze .
Remember , he 's a man of muscle .
He suffers from the pangs of frustration .
- l said you were a low- - - l 'm sorry. I didn 't mean it .
They got me mad with all these guns staring me in the face .
That 's all it is .
You know , I 'm in sympathy with you , Boze , I really am .
Ever read All Quiet on the Western Front ?
- No .
- Haven 't you ?
Well , all of us here tonight are under very much the same kind of tension .
- You better have a drink , old man .
- l love you , Gabby .
- Please tell me you forgive me . - Excuse me .
Would you rather I left ?
- Stay where you are .
- But I 'm intruding .
- Sit down .
- lt 's all right , Alan .
- We 've got nothing to hide .
- No . Worse luck .
You know , I 'm sorry for you , Boze , I really am .
There 's one thing I 'll say : You 're a good lovemaker when you get going .
I wasn 't turning on any act .
I told you I was full of love .
- And I was telling the truth .
- So you 're full of love , are you , halfback ?
Keep it up , kid .
I 'm rooting for you . Touchdown !
- Keep your hands on the table .
- l 'm gonna comb my hair !
You don 't know what it is to be really crazy about somebody .
For all you know , maybe I do .
Get me a cigar , will you , sister .
Say , Duke .
You fellers gonna stay here all night ?
Can 't say , pop .
Maybe we 'll decide to get buried here .
You better come with me , Duke .
I 'm planning to be buried in the Petrified Forest .
I 've formed a theory about that that would interest you .
It 's the graveyard of the civilization that 's shot from under us .
The world of outmoded ideas .
They 're all so many dead stumps in the desert .
That 's where l belong .
And so do you , Duke .
For you 're the last great apostle of rugged individualism .
Maybe you 're right , pal .
Oh , I 'm eternally right .
But what good does it do me ?
I couldn 't say .
Hey , who were you ever crazy about ?
Well , if you 've got to know , it 's him .
What ?
I was telling Boze that I 'm crazy about you .
- Who , me ?
- That panhandler ?
- Did you ever see him before ?
- No , but it really doesn 't matter .
I love him. I guess I 'll never really love anybody else .
Can I possibly be drunk ?
After you left , I felt as if something had been taken out of me .
As if I was sort of coming out of a dream .
Then I caught on and realized I was only a desert rat ... ... and that 's all I 'd ever be .
Do you know what I asked him ?
I asked him if I could go away with him .
But you wouldn 't have , even if we 'd had the money .
Would you , Alan ?
- Would you ?
- No , no , Gabrielle .
No .
You see ?
He doesn 't give a hoot in the hot place about me .
I saw that plainly enough .
It only made me love him all the more .
That 's why I was willing to go out with you in the moonlight ... ... when Duke Mantee came in .
I 'm sorry , sister. I don 't like to interfere with anybody 's fun .
It 's all right .
It was probably just for the best .
Yes .
When I look at you , I guess it was .
You know , I 'm sorry now that I came back .
I 'll take a drink of that stuff .
Are you sorry you heard the truth ?
I 've told you , I 'm the kind of person to whom the truth is always distasteful .
Your wife must have treated you terribly .
- Why do you say that ?
- She talked all the heart out of you .
I could put it back .
No , no .
Don 't delude yourself .
You better not drink any more of that rye whiskey .
It isn 't the rye. lt 's the same disease that 's afflicting Boze .
- Frustration !
- Sit down , pal .
What do you care whether I sit or stand ?
What can I do to assail your superiority ?
I got to think about my health , pal .
If I had a gun , I wouldn 't know what to do with it .
I want to talk to him .
- Me ?
- You can talk sitting down .
I heard you doing it .
Well , what 's on your mind ?
Those liberty bonds of yours buried in Santa Fe- -
What do you know about them ?
- What will you do with them ?
- Leave them there .
That 's right .
While your granddaughter stifles and suffocates in this desert .
A few of your thousands will give her a chance .
Yes , and maybe give you a chance to steal them .
- l heard what you been saying .
- That 's just a low way ... ... to justify your stinginess .
I know you were a pioneer once , but what are you now ?
A mean old miser , hanging on to your money as though it meant something .
Why don 't you die and do the world some good ?
You must be drunk .
Yeah .
Drunk or just about the lowest-grade rat I ever run across .
What do you mean talking to an old man like that ?
Well , you 're right , Duke. I was guilty of bad taste. I apologize , Mr. Maple .
You 'd better crawl , or I might have to put the lug on you .
Talking to an old man like that .
She 'll get it when she needs it , when she has a family of her own to support .
And probably a good-for-nothing , unemployed husband .
- Three people are coming up the road .
- Okay , keep quiet when they get here .
Reach for it !
I 've got you !
I 've been waiting .
I 've been watching every move that you made .
- Get that gun , Jackie .
- Are you hurt ?
- He got me in the hand .
- Frisk them .
- Get in there , or I 'll shoot you .
- Let us out of here !
We have nothing to do with this .
That sandstorm- -
Shut up .
- l won 't have that man pawing me .
- Get back to the car , Ruby .
That sand 's beginning to blow too hard .
Get back to the car .
Bandage him up , sister .
He 'll be all right .
Go with him .
And you better get a line and tie him up and leave him there .
- So you tried to be brave , did you ?
- l had my chance , and I muffed it .
- Come on , Boze .
- Tough luck , halfback .
Nice try .
Trouble is , you 're just too fast for your interference .
Come on . Get in here .
Sit down over there .
Come on , step on it !
You , down there .
Come on , sit down !
If any more people come in here , we 'll have to be sending out for recruits .
Hi , colored brother .
Good evening .
Boss , we better lam out of here .
With sand blowing , we won 't be able to see .
We go when I say so .
Finish your supper , Slim .
Okay , boss .
See you later , deacon .
Say , Duke .
Did you mean to hit him in the hand , or was that just a bad shot ?
It was a bad shot , pop , but I had to get it off fast .
I let him make a mug out of me , but don 't anybody try it again .
Keep in mind that I and the boys is candidates for hanging .
Any one of you makes a wrong move , I 'm gonna kill the whole lot of you .
Now , keep your seats .
I knew it was a mistake to take that hitchhiker in the car .
- What does he have to do with it ?
- He didn 't help very much .
No , I haven 't helped matters at all , up to now .
Duke , would you mind passing me that rucksack that 's beside you ?
- What do you want with it ?
- l want to get my life insurance policy .
If you reach in there , you 'll find it among a bundle of papers .
What do you want with your insurance papers ?
Expecting to die ?
You guessed it , Mr. Maple .
Thanks .
Now , can I take out my fountain pen ?
It 's just in here .
Say , what about my car ?
That 's a nice bus you got there .
Let 's hope it won 't be all full of bullet holes and blood .
Oh , there 's one little dressing case with some ... .
With some things I need .
May I have that , please ?
I took a look in that case .
I got a friend that likes rubies .
- You mean you 're going to steal them ?
- Yes , ma 'am .
You 're a filthy thief .
Yes , ma 'am .
Say , look here . How much will you take to let us out of here ?
- How much have you got ?
- l can let you have , say , $ 200 cash .
Bring it here .
Just put down the whole wallet .
Down there .
You got any more ?
- l have a little loose change .
- Keep it .
- Well , may we go , then , please ?
- No .
- Look here , I understood- -
- Sit down where you were .
- You 're a mean , contemptible thief .
- Quiet , Edith .
There 's nothing we can do but hope that someday the government ... ... will take measures to protect the life and property of its citizens .
Here 's your wallet , pal .
- Duke , I have a great favor to ask you .
- Yeah ?
Yes. I don 't think you 'll refuse , because you have imagination .
You 're not afraid of doing rather outlandish things .
What are you getting at ?
This insurance policy , it 's my only asset .
It 's for $ 5000 .
I 've written on the back of the policy that I want the money paid to Miss Maple .
Yes , Miss Maple .
That young lady in there .
If Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm witness my signature , it 'll be all right .
You see , what I 'm getting at , Duke , is this :
After they 've signed , I wish ... .
I 'd be much obliged if you 'd just ... ... kill me .
It couldn 't make any difference to you .
Even if they catch you , they can only hang you once .
You know better than anybody they have more than they need against you .
And you needn 't be bothered by any humane considerations .
It will be difficult to find a more suitable candidate for extermination .
I shall be mourned by nobody .
In fact , my passing will evoke sighs of relief in certain quarters .
Besides , you 'd only be carrying out the sentence of the natural law .
Survival of the fittest .
By golly , he is drunk .
Sure , and having a fine time showing off .
Of course I 'm showing off .
I 'm trying to outdo Boze in gallantry .
There 's nothing unnatural in that .
He was willing to risk his life to become an all-American. I 'm ready to do likewise .
Can 't you see that I mean this ?
I 'm afraid I 'm not interested in your whimsicalities .
I don 't blame you , but you must remember , this is a weird country .
These mesas are enchanted .
And you must be prepared for the improbable .
- All I 'm asking you to do is- - - l believe you really do mean it .
Good , Mrs. Chisholm .
You 're a kindred spirit .
I bet that you , too , have been thrilled by A Tale of Two Cities .
You 're in love with her , aren 't you ?
Yes , I suppose I am .
And not unreasonably .
She has heroic stuff in her .
She may be one of the immortal women of France .
Another Joan of Arc , George Sand , Madame Curie or Du Barry .
I want to show her that I believe in her , and how else can I do it ?
Living , I 'm worth nothing to her .
Dead , I can buy her the tallest cathedrals ... ... golden vineyards and dancing in the streets .
One well-directed bullet will accomplish all that .
And it 'll earn a measure of reflected glory ... ... for him that fired it and him that stopped it .
This document will be my ticket to immortality .
It 'll inspire people to say of me , " There was an artist who died before his time . "
Will you do it , Duke ?
I 'll be glad to .
- All right .
Can I have this signed ?
- Sure .
- Say , is he by any chance insane ?
- Don 't ask me .
He 's no friend of mine .
- Of course he 's insane , but what of it ?
- Thank you .
Just sign where l 've written " witnessed this day . "
- Mr .
Maple , I 'm entrusting this to you .
- All right .
After the Duke has obliged , take it to some good lawyer for collection .
Here , this is my passport for identification purposes .
Thanks .
Thank you .
- All right ?
- Sure .
Thank you .
Let me know when you want to be killed .
Pick your own time , Duke .
Say ... ... just before you leave .
I 'd prefer to have her think it was in cold blood .
Would you please all remember that ?
But for the time being , you better sit down .
You might get to feeling reckless .
Let 's have another drink .
Would you mind passing glasses to the Chisholms ?
- Sure .
- And bring me one too .
Come on , boss .
Let 's lam out of here .
- We got to give the others more time .
- But you oughtn 't trust a dame .
They probably got lost in the sandstorm .
They know this country like a book .
Doris knows I picked this place .
Well , I wish she 'd show .
Hey , don 't forget me .
Don 't give it to him , Slim .
The girl says he oughtn 't to have it .
- Hey , where 's that cook ?
- She 's all right. I locked her up .
Have a drink , colored brother .
- ls it all right , Mr. Chisholm ?
- Listen to him , " ls it all right ? "
Ain 't you heard about the big liberation ?
- Take your drink , weasel .
- lt 's all right , Joseph .
- Thank you , sir .
- " Mr. Chisholm . "
- Think it 's all right ?
- Yeah , I guess it 's all right .
But let me tell you one thing , Mr. Squier .
The woman don 't live or ever did live that 's worth $ 5000 .
Let me tell you something .
You 're a forgetful old fool .
Any woman 's worth everything that any man has to give .
Anguish , ecstasy , faith , jealousy , love , hatred ... ... life or death .
You see , that 's the whole excuse for our existence .
It 's what makes the whole thing possible and tolerable .
When you get to my age , you 'll learn better sense .
Did you hear that ?
Yes , I heard .
That lovely girl , your granddaughter , do you know what she is ?
- No , you haven 't the remotest idea .
- Well , what is she ?
She 's the future .
She 's the renewal of vitality and courage and aspiration .
All the strength that 's gone out of you .
I don 't know what she is , but I know she 's essential to me ... ... and the whole godforsaken country and the whole miserable world .
And please , Mrs. Chisholm , don 't look at me quizzically .
I know how I sound .
I was wondering if you really believe all that .
I mean , about women .
Of course I do .
There 's a man who agrees with me .
Don 't you , Duke ?
I don 't know , pal. I wasn 't listening .
All right , then let me speak for you .
He could be across the border by now , and safe .
But he prefers to remain here .
- Do you know why ?
- Why ?
Because he has a rendezvous here with a girl .
- lsn 't that true , Duke ?
- Yes , pal , that 's it .
I guess we 're all a lot of saps , but I wouldn 't be surprised ... ... if he was the champion .
Did you think I was kidding when I said I 'd be glad to knock you off ?
I hope neither of us was kidding .
Did you think I was ?
I just wanted to make sure .
You 're all right , pal .
You got good ideas .
I 'll try to fix it so it don 't hurt .
Well , you 're all right too , Duke .
Like to meet you again ... ... someday.
Maybe it 'll be soon .
You know , this frightful place has suddenly become quite cozy .
Do you realize that we 're going to be witnesses to a murder ?
He 's actually going to shoot him .
Hello . How 's Boze ?
Oh , he 'll be all right .
Listen , Gramp , I was just thinking .
This place will be advertised everywhere .
People will flock to see where Duke stopped .
Good. I like company .
No , I think we ought to sell out right away tomorrow .
Trimble will raise his offer , sure .
You 're still aiming to take that trip to France .
Oh , skip that .
Do it for Dad 's sake .
- Maybe I could get a job in Hollywood .
- And will you be satisfied ?
I 'm not thinking about myself .
- l don 't care what happens to me .
- You must .
You want to be a great artist ?
Then you better get used to being a colossal egotist ... ... selfish to the core .
Are you going to give me more advice ?
You and your talk about nature .
You told me not to listen to you .
- So I did , but I ... .
- That 's all the advice I 'll take from you .
Do you mind if I speak up ?
Perhaps I could tell you some things- -
- What do you know about me ?
- Nothing .
Edith- -
You haven 't the slightest conception of what 's inside me , and you never will .
I don 't know about you , my dear ... ... but I do know what it means to repress yourself , starve yourself ... ... through what you conceive to be your duty to others .
Because I 've been all through that .
When I was your age , I went to Salzburg .
I had a letter to Max Reinhardt. I could have played the nun in The Miracle .
But my family ... ... they started yapping about my obligations to them .
They whisked me back to Dayton .
And before I knew it , I was married ... ... to this pillar of the mortgage , loan and trust .
And what did he do ?
He took my soul and had it stenciled on a card and filed .
And that 's where l 've been ever since , in an odd metal cabinet .
That 's why I think I 've got a little right to advise you .
Oh , dear heaven .
Oh , you needn 't look so martyred .
I 've never complained . I 've given you everything .
At the price of my self-respect , my individuality and everything else .
At the cost of nothing .
Your insane extravagance- -
Be quiet .
Now maybe you 'll realize what I mean .
Profit by my experience .
Maybe you have got something wonderful to give the world ... ... so go to France and ... .
And find yourself .
It 's a peculiar thing about this place ... ... there seems to be something here that stimulates the autobiographical impulse .
Tell us , Duke , what kind of a life have you had ?
What do you think ?
I spent most of my time since I grew up in jail .
And it looks like I 'll spend the rest of my life dead .
Boss , for the last time , let 's lam out of here .
Duke , when you go , if you have room , will you take me with you ?
- Edith , for the love of- -
- Thanks very much , lady .
Maybe when I get settled down in Mexico ... ... I 'll send you a postcard with my address .
Duke , how 's the time getting along ?
It 's just about up , pal .
Gabrielle , I 've got to talk to you .
- Wait till all the others have gone .
- No , I can 't wait .
You see , when they go ... ... I go .
Please come sit down , Gabrielle .
You see ... ... I 've got to tell you now that I love you .
- Alan-- - l tell you solemnly ...
... you 're the first person I ever loved in my life .
He does love you . He told us so .
Please , I 'm quite capable of saying it , you know .
Alan , they 're all staring at us .
I know , but you 've got to believe and remember ... ... because , you see , this is my one chance of survival .
I told you about that major artist that 's been hidden .
Well , I 'm transferring him to you .
You 'll find a line in that poem of Villon 's that fits that . Something about :
Thus in your field My seed of harvestry will thrive
Well , I 've provided barren soil for that seed ... ... but you 'll give it fertility and growth and fruition .
Alan , you ... .
You 're kind of crazy .
And I guess so am I .
That 's why I think we 'd be terribly happy together .
No .
Don 't say that , Gabrielle .
Alan , I believe it with all my heart .
Well , perhaps you 're right .
Perhaps we will be happy together ... ... in a funny kind of way .
If you 're going away , I 'm going with you .
I 'm not going away , Gabrielle .
I told you I was looking for something to believe in , worth living for and dying for .
Well , l- - l believe I found it ... ... here in the valley of the sh- -
Alan , what have you found ?
I don 't know .
I really don 't quite know yet .
Well , Duke , what are we waiting for ?
Watch it , boys .
Get over by that door , Jackie .
Keep them covered , Slim .
Stick them up !
Turn around and keep moving .
Open that door , Jackie .
Come on , boys , walk in that door and keep them up .
Keep moving !
Get those guns , Jackie .
- Get back to the car .
- ls this a stickup ?
- What a guesser .
- l 'm the commander- -
- So what ?
- You wouldn 't shoot us in cold blood .
- Sure , we would .
- Sit down , boys .
- Where ?
- On the floor , Black Horse troops .
- Why 'd you come here ?
- We trailed you .
- And we 've caught up with you .
- Shut up .
What made you bring the regiment ?
- What made you think I 'd be here ?
- They caught your pals .
Three men and a blond .
Where was it ?
Don 't you try to get them out now .
Tell me or I 'll tear holes a yard wide in them uniforms !
- Buckhorn .
- Where 's that ?
- About 20 miles away .
- Anybody else coming ?
I don 't know. I swear I don 't .
But there 's posses all around here .
You 've got the strength of the nation after you .
That woman in that car did some talking .
Doris , she snitched .
They always do .
Shut up .
- What were you saying ?
- l 'm telling you for your own good .
They know where you were heading .
They 'll get you .
She has snitched .
Come on .
- Don 't listen .
- Come on , or we 're all dead .
- The law 's closing in .
- What 's the matter ?
Do something .
Shut up !
Shut up !
- Give me time to think .
- No , don 't you waste time thinking .
Don 't listen to what they 're telling you .
You 've got to keep going and going .
Yeah , and go fast , storm or no storm .
You 've been double-crossed .
Next , you 'll be on a marble slab .
- Where 'd they take her ?
- Maybe to Albuquerque .
- lf we go there , they 'll take us !
- You want revenge , don 't you ?
You 'll go out of your way to get that blond who snitched .
Don 't do it , Duke .
Even if she did betray you , don 't commit a worse crime .
Don 't betray yourself .
Run for the border and take your illusions with you .
- He 's right , Duke .
- Shut up .
You know they 're going to get you anyway .
You 're obsolete , like me .
You 've got to die .
Then die for freedom . That 's worth it .
Don 't give up your life for anything so cheap as revenge .
I hear a car coming down the road , Duke .
I 'm going .
You 've had a pleasant evening . I don 't want to spoil it with killing .
Stay put until we 're out of sight . We 'll be watching .
- Pick up that sack , Slim .
- Wait a minute .
You 're not forgetting me .
- That 's Ruby shooting .
- That fathead .
Tell him to hold his fire .
We don 't want them drilling our car .
Wait a minute !
Tell him to open up if they drift around that side .
You have no right to endanger innocent people .
Get behind that counter .
Cover this mob .
Okay , boss .
What they doing now ?
If they can 't see us any better than I can see them , we 're okay .
- Hey , where 's that sack ?
- The sack 's right there beside you .
Boy , I knew this place wasn 't safe .
You folks lie down , close together in the middle .
Watch them , Slim .
- Okay .
- Where 's that light switch ?
- Right over there , behind that door .
- Turn them off , Jackie .
Heading for the rear .
Get out that back door .
Hold your fire unless they rush it .
Then we 'll lam .
- How many are there ?
- Six or seven .
- Watch yourself , kid .
- Okay , Duke .
You know , this is an impressive spectacle , Gabrielle .
The United States of America versus Duke Mantee .
They 're gonna wreck that neon sign .
They 're probably all drunk .
It 's almost restored in me the will to live and love and conquer .
Listen , Edith , if I 'm killed- -
- What did you say ?
- l said , if I 'm killed ... ... and you 're not , get in touch with Jack Laverie .
He has full instructions .
Oh .
All right .
I feel as if I was sitting on the top of a mountain ... ... in the middle of Penguin Island , watching- -
- Watching the odd , little creatures .
- Boss , why ain 't Jackie shooting ?
The kid knows what he 's doing .
What 's the first thing you see when you get to France ?
- Customs offices .
- No , I mean , what 's the first real sight ?
Well , the fields and forests of Normandy .
Then ... .
- What , Alan ?
- Then Paris .
Listen , I better go tell Jackie to open fire .
- Stay where you are !
- But you asking an awful lot .
Paris .
That must be the most marvelous place in the world for love , isn 't it , Alan ?
- All places are marvelous , Gabrielle .
- Even here ?
Especially here , my darling .
As long as I live , I 'll be grateful to the Duke .
Alan .
Alan , will you please kiss me ?
Okay , Slim , we 're pulling out .
Tell Ruby to get that car started and get Jackie .
Oh , Lord . Now it 's going to be all over .
Not for us .
Never .
Go get our car started .
Jackie 's got killed .
- How 'd he do that ?
- l don 't know .
We got to leave him .
You , you , you and you are coming with us .
We gotta have shields .
- Me too ?
- No , not you , pop .
Get moving !
- Move fast .
- ln the name of heaven , don 't let- -
Turn on that light , Slim .
Let them see who 's coming out .
Get moving out that door !
You won 't get hurt if you move fast !
Keep your hands up and move out the front door !
- Come on !
- Slim , get them out of there !
- You folks stay where you are for a while .
- Alan , keep down .
- Duke , you 're forgetting something .
- Nix , pal .
Get down .
- Get away from there .
- You think I 'll let you slaughter them ?
- Cut out the act , pal .
- l won 't let you do it , Duke .
Okay , pal .
I 'll be seeing you soon .
Alan !
He did mean it .
Which way did they go ?
You can head them off through that back door .
Be careful , those are innocent people on the running boards !
- You said you wanted to live !
- l know I did .
- And I 'll live with you , I will .
- l know I did. I was blind then .
Now I can see .
Gramp ! Dad !
Somebody , come here , quick .
You know , they were right , Gabrielle .
The stars , I mean .
I had to come all this way to find a reason .
The Duke ... ... understood what it was I wanted .
I hope you ... .
I hope you ... .
What , Alan ?
What did you say ?
Alan !
Are you all right , old man ?
- l guess he 's dead . - Sure , he 's dead .
Mantee couldn 't have missed twice .
Funny thing , Gabby .
His life insurance for $ 5000 is made out to you .
It looks real too .
Said he wanted you to spend it on a trip to France to see your mother .
Funny thing about that feller .
I never could make him out .
We 'll bury him out in the Petrified Forest .
What ?
- That 's what he said he wanted .
- That 's what he said .
- Well ... .
Maybe his next of kin will have something to say about it .
I 've got to phone the sheriff at Flagstaff .
Sheriff 's office , Flagstaff .
Yeah .
Jason Maple .
Mantee was here .
What ?
They got him ?
Great work .
They got Mantee .
They never get away with that stuff long , you know .
Yeah .
Took you a long while to get him , though .
Thus in your field My seed of harvestry will thrive
For the fruit is like me that I set
God bids me tend it with good husbandry
This is the end for which We twain are meant
Gentlemen , the war is over at last .
The men are coming back .
The living are coming back .
We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers .
Idle men .
Men badly in need of work , Mr. President .
Gentlemen , we have the country to save fiirst .
But these men have saved their country . Now the country must save them .
Their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry ... by furnishing suddenly a greater supply oflabor than for which there could be a demand .
Mr. President .
Mr. Colfax .
I have read an editorial in the Terra Haute Express ... written by Mr.John Soule , in which he says , " Go west , young man . "
Where there is room for all .
Gentlemen , our land stretches from an Eastern sea to a Western sea .
Surely , in that vast territory , there is a place for men to live and work and be happy .
Right , Mr. President .
True , Mr. President .
I hope to attract our disbanded soldiers to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges ... and to the wealth that lies in the soil itself .
And to the grasslands of the Great Plains .
The fields of Illinois , the broken sod of Kansas , the long furrows of the West .
Yes , Mr. President , but if only the frontier could be made safe for the plow .
It must be made safe .
But during the war hostile Indians massacred our settlers there .
- Mr. Lincoln ?
- Yes , Mary ?
We 'll be late for the theater .
Gentlemen , I promised to take Mrs. Lincoln to Ford 's Theater tonight .
We will continue this tomorrow ... for the frontier must be made safe .
Good night , Mr. President .
Good night . Good night , Mr. President .
I have never seen him looking so well .
But the war is over , and we have on our hands order after order ... canceled by the government .
Hundreds of thousands of rifles unsold .
Once we were the saviors of our country .
Now we 're outcasts . Our money invested in an unsalable product .
But a good product , gentlemen .
A new repeating rifle would have made short work of the war ... had it been introduced earlier .
But now the subject of guns is an unpopular topic ... to those who needed them so badly a short while ago .
We 'll have to look to Providence for a market .
Providence ? Where ?
I 've been told that the Indians hunt with bow and arrow .
Still , they obtain furs , valuable buffalo hides , otter , fox and beaver .
With our new repeating rifle- -
Dearie me . Why shouldn 't we be frank ?
I have every reason to believe the Indians will pay $ 1 00 for each rifle .
A hundred dollars ? In furs .
And a dollar a piece for every cartridge .
But we can 't sell rifles to the Indians !
I think we can ... to peaceable Indians .
But how- - For hunting .
They furnish us with furs . We supply them with rifles .
Really quite simple .
Won 't they use those guns against white men ?
We 'll get the Indians to promise not to do so .
I 'm against this !
But why ?
It 's bound to make trouble on the frontier .
President Lincoln says- - We have a perfect right to do it .
Sheer nonsense . !
The army would stop us .
They control trade with the Indians .
They did , my friend .
But Indian affairs have been taken out of the hands of the army ... and given to a civilian authority .
A civilian authority ?
Yep , in which we are to have a certain participation .
Do I make myself clear ?
Perfectly .
But who sells the rifles ?
Ask Mr. Lattimer to come in .
Perhaps not the most personable gentleman ... but certainly the man for our needs .
Gentlemen , this is Mr.John Lattimer , How do you do ?
who will distribute our rifles through St. Louis ... to Hays City and all the Great Plains .
Right , Mr. Lattimer ?
I said I 'd do it .
Van Ellyn , if ever Mr. Lincoln finds out- -
It 's a legitimate business .
The Ford Theater . !
Open that window !
Lincoln shot at Ford 's Theater . !
The president is dying . !
Hear that ?
Someone has shot the president .
They say he 's dying .
Only yesterday afternoon I was talking to him at the Capitol .
Maybe it isn 't true . We must learn the facts .
A terrible thing , Mr. Lattimer .
Yes , a national calamity .
You will leave at once for St. Louis .
Dearie me . Terrible thing .
- Excuse me , soldier !
- Bull 's-eye !
I didn 't see ya .
That 's all right , son .
Come here and let me see your gun .
You haven 't got any notches on it .
What 'd I kill ?
Don 't you see that great big buffalo laying there kickin ' ?
Yeah . He 's a big one , ain 't he ?
Give me your knife , and we 'll skin ' im .
You better not .
You might find out he 's been eating potatoes .
Gee , whillikens . I 'll bet you could kill a buffalo with this knife .
You can 't kill a buffalo with a knife .
Aw . I 'll bet Buffalo Bill could .
You know what I saw him do once ?
What ? First give me back my Arkansas toothpick .
You give me back my gun .
I saw Buffalo Bill shoot at a whole herd of them once .
At first I thought he 'd missed . Then two of them started coughing and fell down dead .
He 'd killed ' em both and raised a big cloud of dust a mile and a half the other side of them .
And that isn 't all .
That little cloud of dust he raised grew into a whirlwind , turned itself into a cyclone and wiped out one-fourth ofTexas ... before they could stop it .
Jimminies !
That 's the kind of shooting ' I aim to do .
That whistle 's just a half a minute wrong .
Listen .
Don 't that beat all .
Cute , isn 't it ?
Say , you 're dressed like a scout there .
So 's your sister .
That 's not my sister . That 's CalamityJane .
Was she your best girl ?
Son , one of these days you 're gonna grow up , and you ought to know about women .
You see , the thing is this , women are , uh- -
Well , they 're , um- -
Well , son- -
I can tell you what an Indian will do to ya , but you never know what a woman will do .
Why ?
Well- -
Let 's go down and take a look at that fire engine .
If you don 't like her , what do you carry her picture around for ?
It 's the only good picture of me I ever had taken .
I can 't cut her off without cutting off my chin .
John Lattimer , 1 7 .
I see a good mark .
John Lattimer , 1 8 .
Wait . I see an easy mark .
Where ?
John Lattimer , 1 9 .
Oh , yes .
Hello , Virginia !
I 'll be around shortly .
We hate to say good-bye . When you comin ' back ?
When you come and see me .
I want you to take Hannibal .
He sings .
Oh , Will , look .
I see a good fighting man who 's been fool enough to get himself married .
What 's the matter ?
Oh , my hats !
Jiggers ! Let 's duck .
Here .
Hold on , bub . Come back here .
Hey , who do you think you 're- -
Bill !
You long-legged , fugacious old gallinipper !
What are you doin ' here ?
Well , I , uh- -
Here 's somebody who wants an introduction to you .
Boy , you wouldn 't know him in these tinhorn garments , but this is the best scout west of the Mississippi .
Shake hands with Buffalo Bill .
Buffalo Bill !
Howdy , youngster .
Son , this fellow taught me all I ever knew about scouting ' .
You mustered out yet , Bill ?
Yesterday .
Ya ain 't losing ' much time gettin ' up the Big Muddy .
He seems to have met a friend .
Yes , a rather strange friend .
How long have you been out ?
Oh , about three months .
I see she hasn 't cut your hair ... yet .
I don 't know what you mean , Bill .
You know what happened to Samson when Delilah opened her barbershop .
Has she tamed you yet ?
That ain 't fair .
She 's different .
You 're different .
Bill , she 's the finest little gal- - I know , I know .
You gotta meet her .
No , Bill . Women and me don 't agree .
All that 's goin ; get aboard . !
Come on ! You 'll like her .
All that 's goin ' , get aboard !
Don 't be nervous . He 'll be here .
Come , Will !
Hurry . !
All right , Lou .
I want you to meet the best friend- - We haven 't time .
All that 's goin ; get aboard . !
Bye , Buffalo Bill ! Bye !
Bye , Louisa . !
Good-bye !
Honey , we 're on our way .
You 're not frightened , are ya ?
I 'm not frightened of anything after these three wonderful months .
It 's a big place we 're going to- - the West- - isn 't it ?
Good-bye , Buffalo Bill ! Huh ?
What 's the matter , boy ?
Good-bye , bub .
That 's yours .
Gee !
Thanks , mister !
Don 't forget what I told ya about women .
And here 's your gun .
Good hunting !
I 'm Jack McCall , Mr. Hickok .
Tickled to death to be traveling with you .
Pleased to meet you .
Hey , your toothpick 's on fire .
This ain 't a toothpick .
" Cigareetes , " they call them back East .
Oh , I see .
Barkeep , bring me an applejack , will ya ?
Yes , sir . You want one ?
No .
I call ya .
I have ace , king , queen , jack and a ten .
Sorry , mister .
Mr. Hickok .
I 'd like to speak to you .
Good evening , ma 'am .
I 'm Louisa Cody .
Will 's told me how long you 've been friends ... and how you fought for him once .
He says you don 't trust women . Not as a rule , Mrs. Cody .
But in your case- -
Mr. Hickok , I 'm going to help Will .
Don 't you believe I can ?
Well , I don 't know , ma 'am .
I 'll open .
He killed his first Indian at 1 2 .
But he 's not- - At 1 4 , he was riding Pony Express .
He 's one of the best natural scouts on the frontier .
Will 's promised to give up scouting and killing Indians ... and all that nonsense .
The West is in his blood . You can 't change that .
But you 've been away from it so long .
It is changing , and why shouldn 't Will change with it ?
We 're going to start a little hotel .
Cody ?
Yes .
Someday you may be one of our neighbors with a wife of your own .
Excuse me , ma 'am , but the hotel keeper seems to be in trouble ... with his neighbors right now .
I 'll bet you $ 20 . Hello , Bill .
Don 't play that hand .
- Why not ?
- Maybe you can trust one woman- - authorities differ- - but three ?
Not on your life .
Your wife wants to talk to you .
She 's outside .
Well , if you don 't mind , gentlemen .
It 's all right .
How much money did you lose ?
About $ 48 .
I 'll sit in for you . Any objections , gentlemen ?
No , no objections at all .
We 've got new blood in the game .
Heinie .
Yes , sir ?
Take the gentlemen 's order .
Take the order all around .
Rye for me .
Applejack , please .
Rye .
No , thank you .
Ante .
Cut .
Heinie ?
Yes , sir .
Bring me something cool .
Well , I 'll bet you $ 50 .
I 'll see that and raise you 1 00 .
On that watch ? Yes , it 's a mighty fine watch .
Plays a tune whenever you press that little spring .
It ain 't worth $ 1 50 .
It is to me .
I 'll redeem that watch anytime for a thousand .
All right , I 'll take your word on it , and I 'll up ya 300 .
And I 'll call ya .
They 're all blue , mister .
Watch yourself . What 's the matter ?
I 'm calling the hand that 's in your hat .
Take it off !
Take a look , Mr.Jayhawker. The name is Hickok .
Hickok ?
Not Wild Bill Hickok ?
Mr. Hickok to you .
I 'm calling this hand .
And I 'm taking this pot .
Maybe I ought to shoot a couple of holes through your ears , so we 'll know you .
Men like you ought to be marked .
Maybe he 'll do it too .
Wouldn 't be no trick at all for Bill .
He 's my friend .
He can hit a dime at 30 paces .
Four times out of five .
Five times out of five .
He killed the whole McDaniels gang .
And he got ' em alone too .
Does he kill like that ?
Ain 't a corpse maker like him , honey .
Cash these in , Mr. Banker .
It 's a pleasure , Mr. Hickok .
Maybe I ought to take Mr. Cody 's losings too .
He 's got a wife to support .
Whoa there !
Lizzie 's two hours late .
Hustle your passengers off .
I 'll pick the best of them for you , Calamity .
My horses ain 't used to waiting ' .
Back up there , Joe !
Mark three !
Look out !
Don 't foul that hauser there !
Hey , there . !
Leavenworth landing !
All for Leavenworth get off .
Hey ! Aboard there !
Purser ! Watch the line .
My name 's John Lattimer .
You got a bunch of freight for me put aboard at St. Louis ?
Yeah , lots of it consigned to Hays City .
I got my own wagons here !
I want that stuff shouldered off first up !
Right away !
Hey , Tim !
Hustle that shipment forJohn Lattimer off .
Come on , boys ! Get goin ' !
Hi , Calamity .
Hi , yourself .
Keepin ' company tonight ?
Yeah , me and my six horses .
Seven 's a lucky number .
Count me in .
You sailors are all alike .
Hey , Bill !
Help me pack this outfit ashore .
Jumping Jehoshaphat !
What is this ?
Feathers ? Hats .
" Hats " ?
Lou , Bill will take you off to the stage .
I got to go see about the trunks .
This going to be the hotel orchestra , ma 'am ?
Bill , we 're not joking about that hotel .
I guess a hotel suits you after all .
Start with a birdcage and expand , huh ?
Lattimer , six .
Come on , boys . ! Get along here . !
Lattimer , seven .
Lattimer , eight .
Keep ' em on your backs there .
I 'm sorry , boss .
Powerful heavy to tote .
- Shut your lip !
John Lattimer , nine . Hey ! Take this box !
Yes , sir !
Get out , you ! John Lattimer , ten .
Lattimer , 1 1, goin 'to Hays City .
Don 't that look like- -
Farming tools .
You operate out of Hays City ?
Sure ! What of it ?
Didn 't have any use for farming tools the last time I was there .
I freight whatever they send me , and I mind my own business .
John Lattimer , 1 5 .
That 's a right good idea , a right , good way to keep out of trouble .
John Lattimer , 1 6 .
Bill ! You mangy old coyote !
John Lattimer , 1 8 .
Bill , you 're back .
Aw , you four-flushing mule .
You ain 't wiping ' it off . You 're rubbing it in .
Are you gonna stay in Leavenworth ?
Are you ?
I could . I 'm going on to Hays City .
Why didn 't you write me any letters , Bill ?
I didn 't know you could read .
I could read if you could write .
A woman who has a fellow at every stage station ... and a beau in every cavalry troop west of the Missouri- -
That woman doesn 't need any letters from me .
Those fellers didn 't mean nothin ' to me .
They did to me .
Let 's forget it . Maybe I did make a mistake .
You won 't get a chance to make that mistake again .
Bill ! You 'll have to excuse me .
I 'm keeping a lady waiting .
I 'm awfully sorry to have put you to so much trouble , Mr. Hickok .
That 's all right . I don 't know what could have happened to Will .
This is the Hays City stage , ma 'am .
I 'll fetch Will and the rest of the outfit .
Thank you .
Is that chipmunk yours ?
Did ya bring her with ya ?
What if I did ? It 's none of your business .
Ain 't it , after you run out on me ?
You slab-sided , bird-totin ' rat !
You brung that honky-tonk mopsy- - Shut up , Calamity .
Tip your hat when you speak to a lady .
I will , when I speak to a lady .
Careful , Lou . That 's a big step .
Look out for Hannibal .
I 've got you and the parasol and Hannibal ... and boxes and hats and- - Will , isn 't it exciting ?
Have you got everything ?
Hi , Calamity !
Well , Bill Cody !
What are you doin' in them buzzard feathers ?
Pretty fancy , huh ?
Calamity , I want to introduce you .
Lou , this is CalamityJane .
Everybody knows her .
Born and bred out yonder .
A dead shot , rides better than a man , drives stage .
Why , I 've seen her flick the rattles off a rattle- -
Say , is she your mopsy ?
She 's Mrs. Cody .
Your wife !
Aw . I 'm certainly glad to know ya , Mrs. Cody .
How do you do , Miss Calamity ?
Canary 's the name , ma 'am .
I beg your pardon . I didn 't know .
Not at all , ma 'am .
Four passengers for Hays City , Calamity .
Get going . Suits me .
You 'll find the backseat easy riding ' , Mrs. Cody .
Come on , Bill . Get in .
That 's no way to treat your passengers .
You ain 't a passenger .
You 're freight .
My name 's Jack McCall . I 'm goin ' to Hays City .
What are you smokin ' ?
Chalk ? Cigareete .
Well , get in anyway .
Another one for Hays City , ma 'am .
That river clipper 's sayin ' good-bye to you , ma 'am .
Now you 're gonna have three long days of this prairie clipper .
But tomorrow 's Sunday .
Do we ride on Sunday ?
There 's no Sunday west ofJunction City , no law west of Hays City and no God west of Carson City .
Hold tight , ma 'am .
I 'm holding tight .
Still traveling ' together , Mr. Hickok , huh ?
What are you doin ' up here ?
I 'm drivin ' .
Get ! Get up there !
Get up there !
You 've been driving for three days .
You 've changed horses 1 4 times .
Don 't you ever change those beads you 're wearing ?
I ain 't wearing ' ' em 'cause you give ' em to me .
I 'm wearin ' ' em 'cause I like beads .
Oh , Will , are all the roads in Kansas like this ?
No , honey !
Some of 'em are pretty bad .
What 's the matter ?
Clem ?
Take these ribbons . Yeah ?
Stranger , I wonder if you could- - Breezy !
Why , it 's Bill Hickok .
I thought you was off to the war .
The war 's over .
Yeah ?
Just beginning where I come from .
There 's 2,000 or 3,000 Sioux Indians cayoodlin ' around Fort Piney with war paint on .
Wild Bill Hickok to see General Custer .
I 'll see him .
Yes , sir .
How do you do , General ?
Oh , hello , Hickok .
I heard you were coming to town .
I know of your reputation as a killer , and I want to warn you ... that we 'll tolerate no lawlessness here at Hays City .
You better get that word through to the Indians , because they 've just wiped out half the garrison at Fort Piney .
- How do you know ?
- I was about to report to you ... before you became so interested in my accomplishments ... that we 've been pulling arrows out of Colonel Carrington 's old scout .
Breezy ?
Yes .
Colonel Carrington told him if you didn 't get ammunition to Fort Piney , they 're done for .
Find Captain Reed !
Yes , sir .
I 'll get that ammunition to Fort Piney somehow . But I can 't spare more than one troop to take it .
Here at Hays City , I 'm faced by Satanta 's Kiowas .
The whole Sioux nation 's up here .
And now Yellow Hand 's on the loose with his Cheyenne .
I can 't move from Hays City until I find out where that he-wolf s heading for .
He 's an old friend of mine .
We used to hunt buffalo together on the Cimarron .
He 's hunting men now , and I 've got to locate him .
Maybe I can find him for ya .
He ought to be just about ... there .
Hmph . Oh , Captain Reed .
Yes , sir .
Hickok reports that half of Carrington 's command at Fort Piney 's been wiped out .
I 'm sending 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition .
Have Captain Woods prepare to leave at once with a wagon train .
Mules are right handy animals , General .
What ? They can get by the Indians much better than wagons can .
Yes , he 's right .
Use mules . They 'll have to get by about a thousand Cheyenne .
Why not send them east of the trail through Deep Valley ?
Yes , and across the upper ford of the Republican , but who 's going to guide them ?
I haven 't got a scout who knows that territory .
I beg your pardon , but Buffalo Bill Cody just got in town .
Cody ?
Yes , he knows the lay of that land .
And he 's up to all Indian tricks .
He 's got himself a squaw .
You 'll probably find him knitting or washing dishes .
What do you mean ?
He 's married a ravishing little woman from points East .
I don 't care if he married an Eskimo .
Tell him to come here .
His mind 's set on starting a hotel .
There 's an Indian war starting .
Women lying on these plains with Indian arrows in them .
Get Cody here .
- Suppose I go in his place ?
- You 're going after Yellow Hand .
Don 't let him catch you .
He doesn 't treat his prisoners very well .
Tell Cody that ammunition train is leaving before sundown .
Yes , sir .
And he 'll be leaving with them .
Orderly .
Oh , Will , there 's so much dirt blowing in .
It 's got to blow someplace , honey .
Tumbleweed , Lou .
They won 't bite ya .
Oh , dear !
There 's no use fighting ' the wind , Lou .
We have to bear with this land .
Oh , I know , Will .
When are we going to move into town and take over the hotel ?
I 'm gonna see Jeb Masters tomorrow .
He wants to sell the Golden Rule House .
Here 's your grub !
Why , come in , Miss Canary .
Hiya , Bill .
What 'd you bring ?
Well , I 'll tell ya .
I got something to fry , and I got something to boil .
And a jug of whiskey !
Oh ! He never misses , Mrs. Cody .
I 'll take that .
You 've got a lot to do .
That stove smokes , and there 's no mattress on the bed .
You haven 't got the lamps filled yet .
Look at this place .
This is a grand shebang .
Oh , Calamity . You could stable the queen of Sheba .
How can you say that ?
It 's so dusty , and I haven 't got my curtains hung yet .
We 'll help ya .
Hey , you long-legged two-spot , give your wife a hand .
And here 's the bodkin .
Hey ! Put it in that window .
Say !
Look it . That would make a pretty dress , wouldn 't it ?
Calamity , do you ever wear dresses ?
I might if I had one .
You 're going to look awfully nice in one of mine .
That curtain looks right pretty .
Bodkin Bill .
Have you had any experience with a horse blanket ?
Plenty .
Lou says I 've had too much .
That 's too bad .
There 's a horse outside waiting ' for ya now .
You tryin ' to trade , Bill ?
Yes . A hotel for the lives of 48 men ... and 1 0,000 rounds of ammunition thrown in .
How do you do , Mr. Hickok ?
You and the bird feel at home yet , ma 'am ?
Won 't you sit down ?
Thank you . Is Custer sending that ammunition to Fort Piney ?
He 's hoping they 'll get through ... if 48 cavalrymen can dodge about 1 , 000 Cheyenne .
Birds do not eat beans , Mr. Hickok .
You think those swatties can make it ?
Depends which way Custer sends ' em .
Through Deep Valley .
Through the upper ford of the Republican .
Yeah . They might get through that way .
They would get through if Bill Cody showed them how .
There 's no trail .
Better no trail if they 're dodging Cheyenne .
Will 's not going .
He has nothing to do with the army now .
He 's promised .
That 's just what I told Custer .
What did you tell him ?
That you wouldn 't go .
You know that 's a lie .
Mr. Hickok , Will promised me .
You don 't understand . I can 't let him go .
There are things that have to be done , ma 'am .
Lincoln set a goal that we have to work toward .
He said the frontier must be made safe .
Oh , but Lincoln 's dead .
What right have the dead to tell the living what to do ?
His words are alive .
Bill Cody knows that as well as I do .
If he refuses to go , you 'll think he 's a coward , and you know he 's not .
The choice is his , ma 'am .
Will , I was afraid of this .
You can 't leave me .
You can 't- -
You 've never seen the Indian tribes at war .
You 've never seen men killed and mutilated and bodies of women burned ... and babies dragged from their mother 's arms and dashed against- -
That 's enough , Bill !
Why is it you aren 't going , Mr. Hickok ?
I have to pay a call on an old friend .
You 're goin ' after Yellow Hand .
Bill , you 're goin ' out alone !
You cold decker , ain 't you got no sense ?
Maybe I can get you another string of beads .
Ya ornery coot !
Good-bye , my darling .
Oh , Will , please- -
I 've got to go , dear . I know every foot of the way .
I have to do my part .
I 'll look out for you , Mrs. Cody .
He 'll be back in a few days .
He 'll be back with nary a scratch on him .
Will ! Will ! Come back !
Don 't cry , honey .
I wanted to tell him something .
Maybe if he 'd known , he wouldn 't have gone .
Oh . Well , maybe it 's just as well you didn 't tell him .
What is this , Louisy ?
It 's sort of a Russian cat .
Say .
Look at that .
I don 't know how I look , but I feel like the queen of Sheba .
You look lovely , Calamity .
I want you to keep that dress .
Ya do ?
Say , that 's the first time a woman ever gave me anything .
Why , I never even seen clothes like these .
Now , if I just had me a hat !
Here , try one of these .
Oh , say , ain 't that a pretty one .
Well , how do you do , Miss Canary ?
Appears to me your face is kind of made out of rubber .
That old coyote 's got a toad in his gullet .
Couldn 't be an Indian , could it ?
Honey , when you hear something yelling at night , it 's just some varmint .
But when you don 't hear nothin ' , it 's an Injun .
Calamity , I want you to stay here with me .
I 've never been alone before .
Now , stop worryin' about him , honey .
He 's got a whole troop of cavalry riding ' herd on him .
But my Bill plays it alone , the big mule .
I bet if he could see me in this outfit , it 'd be my weddin ' dress .
I 'd just as leave die with my boots on , but I ain 't a-gonna to get married in ' em .
Can I have some shoes ?
Louisy , don 't look at the windows .
Don 't let on anything 's different . Listen to me .
Can you ride ?
Yes .
My horse is outside .
Take that coffeepot back to the stove .
Then open that door and wait .
Make believe you 're helping me with my glove .
I 'm gonna entertain visitors .
They 're Injuns . Injuns !
Shut up . When you see them all in here , sneak to the horse .
Ride to town . Don 't stop for nothin ' .
Tell ' em there 's Injuns here with war paint on .
Make me some fresh coffee , honey .
Come in , fellows .
Come on in . Don 't be afraid .
- I got something for ya .
Look . I got some presents for ya .
See ? See the pretty feather ?
Sure .
Sure .
It 's a hat .
See ? Here .
Here , put it on .
Come on .
Go look at the pretty feather , you painted buzzard .
Here . Here , look .
Pretty ?
You don 't like it , huh ? Well , here . Take this .
I got something for all of ya .
Presents for all of you . We 've been savin ' ' em .
Look .
Presents for my brothers , the Cheyenne , you red hyenas .
Here . Look .
See ? Look . Here .
Come on in .
Look .
See ? Here .
Come on .
Look . For papoose . See ?
Papoose .
Uh , want a piece of cake ?
Soldier .
" Soldier " ?
Me no talk Cheyenne .
I 'll never tell ya where they 've gone , ya hairless coyote !
Hello there !
Hey !
Bill . !
You get outta here . !
Go back , Bill !
These are Yellow Hand 's men . !
You 're crazy . !
Shoot your way out , Bill !
You 'll get a tomahawk in your brains if you keep askin ' for it .
Indians will sell anything .
They might sell you .
Wild Bill Hickok , walkin' into the hands of a war party .
Custer sure picked himself a great scout .
Aw , Bill , not your watch .
What 's he saying , Bill ?
He wants my guns too .
Don 't give ' em to him .
Don 't give up your guns !
What 's he saying ?
He says he 's got to take us to Yellow Hand first .
He can 't let us go unless Yellow Hand 's willing .
Well , you done it , didn 't ya ?
Yes , I " done it , " all right .
How do you do , Mr. Hickok ?
You sure must remember me .
How do you like me in dresses ?
Thought you were Mrs. Cody at first , in that dress .
Oh .
Mrs. Cody give it to me .
Were you in Cody 's cabin when they caught ya ?
Yeah , celebrating on account of Bill Cody 's kid .
Bill Cody hasn 't got a kid .
He 's gonna have one . He doesn 't know it , does he ?
He would if he stayed home where he belongs .
I 'll tell him ... maybe .
Say , Bill , you give up your watch ... and your guns .
Couldn 't have been on account of me , could it ?
I wanted him to take me to Yellow Hand , so I can find out what he 's up to .
What do you think they 'll do to us ?
We 'll soon find out .
You Hickok .
I know you .
Speak your own language , Yellow Hand .
I 'll understand you .
You , me , speak white man tongue .
I must know you know what I say .
Remember what I told you last time we met ?
I said one of us will lift the other 's scalp .
Which one ?
It looks like it 's up to you to say .
What started you on the warpath , Yellow Hand ?
Where sun rise , white man 's land .
Where sun set , Indian land .
White man come , take our land .
Kill buffalo , our food .
White man promise us food .
White man lie .
Now Cheyenne buy white man 's thunder stick .
Soon war drums sound in all Indian land .
All tribes ride with Yellow Hand .
We drive white man , like buffalo , away , back to rising sun .
Yellow Hand has spoken .
Yellow Hand has spoken .
And you may be right .
But you can 't drive the white man away .
Yellow Hand know .
White man send bullet .
Many , many bullet .
Where ?
Somebody 's romancing Yellow Hand .
You tell where .
I don 't know .
You tell where !
He 's your friend , Bill .
Why don 't you tell him they 're heading east toward Leavenworth ?
Yes , that 's right . To Leavenworth .
- Now I know soldier take bullet .
- They won 't fit your guns .
Hickok , my friend , speak with straight tongue .
Hickok , white man friend , speak with forked tongue .
Now , you tell , which way soldier take bullet ?
Bill , what 's in that watch ?
Bill ! Bill , you got my picture .
You kept it .
I couldn 't get it out without scratching the case .
You 've been actin' like you didn 't care , and all the time- -
Tie up that tongue of yours .
Look at their faces .
Let her go .
She doesn 't know anything .
You too quick to say she not know .
Hickok will not tell , but Yellow Hand will know .
Now is hour of Great Bear rising .
When moon in sky here , Yellow Hand will know .
What 's he talking about the moon for ?
What does he mean ? What are you thinking about ?
I 'm thinking about John Lattimer 's farming tools ... that came up on the boat .
Oh , rifles .
Better rifles than we have .
Seven shot repeaters , and each shot may mean the life of a white man .
But what do you think they 're fixin ' to do to us ?
I think maybe you gave them an idea what to do .
Hear them drums ?
That 's taps for us , ain 't it , Bill ?
Won 't be so hard , goin ' out together .
It 'll be harder than you know .
Calamity , there are only two of us .
Two lives against all those men on the ammunition train .
But I don 't want to die !
I don 't want you to die !
Hang onto yourself .
You 'll have to help me .
Just like you did the first time I saw you , remember ?
I was just a kid and no more sense than I got now , heading ' down the grade with no brakes on .
I loved you then , Bill , just like I do now .
Looks like that moon 's gettin ' ready to show .
You never even gave me a picture , but you kept mine .
I know you care for me a little .
Couldn 't you say it just once ?
Maybe they 'll let us go after all .
Bill Hickok ! You ornery son of a mule !
You wouldn 't give a bad dime to a sick kid , would ya ?
You may be right , Calamity .
No , I ain 't .
I know it . I ain 't worth a bad dime .
Bill- - Bill , every night I talk to ya .
Wantin ' ya .
I know you feel the same .
Won 't you tell me ?
What difference would that make now ?
If only I could hear ya say it once . It would give me somethin ' to keep ... like it was kind of holy , like I could keep it forever .
Yellow Hand find out now which way soldier go .
Yes , Calamity , I do .
I- -
You wait .
Yellow Hand no want to kill Hickok ... but must know which way soldier go with bullet .
When he know , you go free .
Hickok go free .
Don 't talk to him , Calamity !
Don 't trust him !
Bill ! If you no tell which way soldier go with bullet ,
Hickok soon be dead .
Bill Cody 's with that ammunition train !
Forty-eight men are there , Calamity !
Oh , Bill !
I can 't ! You tell ?
No .
Which way ?
Oh , no !
No ! Don 't ! Don 't let them do it !
Don 't !
Please !
Oh ! Which way ?
Don 't forget Cody- - And all those men !
Remember what I told you !
They 're burning him !
They 're killing him !
Put out the fire !
Put out the fire !
Oh . !
Put out the fire ! Which way soldier go with bullet ?
Deep Valley through the upper ford .
Squaw no lie . Yellow Hand no lie .
You free .
I couldn 't help it , Bill .
Won 't you look at me ?
I hope I 'll never have to look at you again .
Look out , Bill !
Look out !
Thing ain 't right here , Captain Wood .
See anything ?
No , but I feel it .
Things ain 't right here .
We can halt over there while you take a look around .
They 're caught , like rats in a trap .
They 're all around us , on both sides of the river !
- We 'll hold this island !
Get those ammunition packs off . Get them out of the line of fire !
I can 't see nothin' to shoot at but smoke .
Where are they ?
They 'll never get out now .
I gotta go down there .
You ain 't goin ' down there .
Get behind this tree and wait .
You 've got to reach General Custer .
I 'll get there , somehow .
Head down Prairie Dog Creek .
Get a fresh mount tomorrow from the Pony Express at Simpson 's .
And if Custer finds out you told Yellow Hand , he 'll give you the firing squad .
He won 't find out .
I 'm gonna tell him .
Tell him you brought a thousand Cheyenne against his 48 men !
Set up that barricade with those saddles !
Those saddles on those barricades , and hurry !
Don 't go too deep with that hole or you 'll get that ammunition in water !
All right , sir .
Burned through the legs .
It feels like it broke the bone .
Your knife , Bill . Give me that scabbard for the splint .
Watch ' em , men !
They may rush us !
Never saw such rifle-fire from Indians !
They haven 't let up for a minute .
There 's either a million of 'em , or they 're using those new repeating rifles .
Look out !
They 're firing ' powerful fast .
It ain 't like what we had at Gettysburg .
Were you at Gettysburg ? I was on the other side in that .
Then you must 've been- -
- Stop talkin ' , you two !
- Get down there ! Aim well and fire slowly .
Hold your fire , men !
That 's a white man !
Cover him , McGinnis !
Cover him !
What would a white man be doin ' out there ?
Holy mackerel !
He hasn 't got a chance !
He 's still ridin ' .
Drop some of them Injuns back of him !
That fellow must have nine lives !
He 'll need every one of 'em .
They got him !
No , they haven 't !
Come on , Bill . ! Run for it . !
Keep those long legs goin ' !
Hi , Bill .
Sufferin ' cats !
Wild Bill !
I 'll tell the captain you 're here .
Tell him I expect to be here for a long time .
Hi , Bill .
You guidin' for Yellow Hand ?
Where 's your feathers ?
Captain Wood , Wild Bill Hickok .
Touch ' em up in those trees .
Range about 200 yards !
Hickok ?
Wild Bill Hickok ?
Yes , sir .
He just dropped in from Yellow Hand .
I thought Custer sent you to locate Yellow Hand .
I located him , didn 't I ? Him and a few Cheyenne .
You sure did a good job .
I notice you 're using his equipment .
You 'll notice it 's better than yours too .
Where did you get that mark on your wrist ?
Bracelet ? Ha . Squaw bracelet .
Takin ' Bill Hickok prisoner just don 't sound right to me .
No ?
What about Bill Cody following his nose into a Cheyenne ambush ?
Looky here .
These Injuns were waitin' for us .
They knew we was comin ' to this ford .
You didn 't tell ' em , Bill ?
Then who did tell ' em ?
I said , who did tell ' em ?
I 've something more important than that to tell you .
You 're gonna be a father .
Huh ?
A daddy .
Well , but , uh- - How did you know ?
Mrs. Cody told Calamity .
Calamity told me .
Well , somebody mighta told me .
Well , uh ... the news didn 't leak out till after we left .
Oh , well then how- - Where did you see Calamity ?
Oh , uh ... around .
Has she got rawhide marks on her wrist too ?
What 's your guess it 'll be , a boy or a girl ?
It 's bound to be one or the other , isn 't it ?
That 's customary .
From what I 've seen of you lately , my guess is a girl .
Girls are all right . If it 's a boy , I suppose he 'll be a bellboy in that hotel of yours .
If it 's a girl , we 'll keep her out of Yellow Hand 's camp .
Hey , Bill .
Hey , soldier .
Wait till I knock the tail feathers off of that turkey .
Help me over to the wagon with him .
They got Buffalo Bill , Captain .
Where 's the doctor , Captain ?
They got him in the first volley .
Bandages are in the box there .
Here 's a fresh one .
Sort of parted your hair , Bill .
Flesh wound . Looks like that little stranger 's gonna have a papa .
Never mind that .
We got plenty of water in the river .
Hickok .
Yes , sir ?
It 's gonna be a siege . Days of it .
After dark , I 'll call for volunteers to try to get back to General Custer .
I 've already sent word to Custer .
Who 'd you send ?
Who 'd you send ? - CalamityJane .
Calamity ?
She oughta get through .
She 'd better get through .
There you are .
I oughta have you stood up and shot .
Why don 't you ? If I had the authority to do it , I 'd like nothing better , but I haven 't .
I can 't make you pay for what you 've done .
You won 't have to .
Ten hut . !
Captain Wood .
Lieutenant Burke .
Sergeant Higgins .
Corporal Brannigan .
Here today and gone tomorrow .
- Bugler Corry .
- Here , but not for long .
Seven days you been calling that roll .
Tomorrow there won 't be anyone left to answer it .
Then I 'll answer ' em all myself .
Private Adams .
Anderson .
Here , and I wish I wasn 't .
I wish I had two more like you .
Bingham .
Six nights I 've been listenin' to the wild talk of the wounded .
'Tis a sad lullaby .
Bronson .
Yo .
What 's left of me .
Cody . - Here .
- He 's up in his hotel .
Coleman .
Still here .
- Three days now since the mule meat went bad .
- It 's six , I tell ya ! Why tell the Indians ?
They know about it . Keep quiet , you baboons ! Seven .
Do you think you 're the only one hearing ' Rankin in sick bay ... talkin 'half the time about that hole through his lung and the rest about his kid ?
He 's so scared he can 't count . It 's six nights .
This paper says they 're expectin ' trouble with the Indians .
Huh ?
- No ?
- Dalrymple ?
Here , and hungry .
Try chewing ' saddle leather .
That 'll ease your stomach .
Aw .
Daniels .
Dowden .
Yo . Easton .
Evans .
Hickok . No hits .
- They 're savin ' him for a hangin ' .
- Houston .
Yo .
Hadley .
Hillman .
What are you makin' that for ?
Holliston .
Sure , and all the Indians won 't be makin' no headstone for me .
Jenkins .
Seven days you been doin ' this .
They don 't answer anymore .
He 's roll calling the dead !
It 's six days ! What difference does it make ?
" What difference does it make " ?
Makes a difference to Gillon , Harry Ketcham and Bailey .
Ray Todd must think it makes a difference where he lies out there .
They might be alive !
Alive ! Easy , son .
Easy .
They might be .
You never can tell what 'll happen .
I knew a fellow lived on the Kaw River by the bridge .
He used to feed a fish , a big catfish , by hand .
- What 's that got to do with it ?
- Now wait a minute .
That catfish got to followin' that fellow out of water for his dinner .
Every day he 'd follow him more .
And one night when the man was walkin 'home across the bridge , not noticing 'the catfiish was followin 'him .
Now that fiish had never seen a bridge before .
He fell off ...
and he drowned .
- Ah , fish can 't drown .
- That must 've been a narrow bridge .
Holy thunder . !
Look at them Injuns . !
Every man up this way !
Hurry , men , hurry !
- Get the wounded out to load the guns !
- Don 't shoot till I give the command .
- Hand me up another rifle .
- Keep your heads down if you wanna keep them on .
Look like buffalo , don 't they ?
A volley 'll stop buffalo .
Volley fire .
Ready ! Not yet .
But , Bill !
Hold your fire , men . Wait for the command .
- They 're riding us down !
- Don 't wait . !
Let ' em have it . !
Not yet !
Now !
Fire !
Load faster . ! Gimme that . !
I 'm doing the best I can .
Fire at the center !
Split that charge !
Fire !
- Who was that ?
- Keep your barrels red hot !
This one 's mine !
- We 've turned ' em !
- Now they 're goin ' down both sides !
Houston !
Jack ! Cover the left flank !
Where are you going , you idiot ?
Hey , Bill , come back here !
Are you crazy ? - Hey , Dave , help me cover him .
- Cover the right flank !
Load your guns , men !
Load your guns ! Remember , you 're still in the army .
Gimme some water .
I gotta have water .
What 's the matter ? Can 't you hear me ?
Load your guns . !
- What 's the use ? We can 't stand another charge .
- We may have to .
No . ! We can 't .
The dead can 't flight anymore .
Why don 't you call roll now ?
You 're afraid ? I 'll call it for you .
Private Dowden . !
- You load your guns !
- Corporal Brannigan .
Load your guns . !
Why don 't you tell Brannigan to load his gun ?
- I 'm telling you . !
Get up . ! - I won 't !
Save that fighting for the Indians !
You 'll see .
Hold onto yourself , fella .
There 's nobody left .
You 'll see .
Why don 't you tell your bugler to sound assembly ?
Stop blubbering and reload your gun !
He can 't answer . Look at him . !
Look at him . !
Saints above .
He 's answering to his name .
Yes , it 's the dead calling .
- Stop it , men !
It 's Bugler Corry .
He 's sounding the charge !
Come on , men , it 's a charge !
No , you fools !
No ! What are you waiting for ?
The dead want us .
McGinnis , hold ' em back .
Fall in men !
- It 's the charge .
Don 't ya hear it ?
- Yes , I hear it .
Come on , follow me !
The boy 's right .
They 're charging .
Get ready , men !
We 'll go down fightin ' !
Come on . !
There they are , over there !
You can see ' em !
- Holy saints !
They know we 're alive .
We 're okay .
Well , Yellow Hand didn 't get that ammunition he was hankering ' for .
He would have , if Calamity hadn 't gotten through to Custer .
She did a good job , all right .
- She must 've told Yellow Hand .
- Let her alone .
She never was good .
Why don 't somebody do somethin 'about it ?
Only 1 8 come back out of 48 .
The Cheyenne must 've paid her plenty to tell ' em .
Paid this woman in money , but our soldiers paid in blood .
What are you gonna do ?
I 'll show you what we 're gonna do .
Talk 's cheap , ya loudmouthed liar .
Hey , you .
Let me out !
All right , you dirty mule-skinner .
If you want it-
- Ow !
If she was a man , we 'd know what to do with her .
Go ahead , you crossbred rat ! If you was a man , you wouldn 't be here !
Run her out of town !
Get some tar . !
Tar and feathers is too good for her .
That 's the way to talk !
Get a rail . !
Here .
Here 's a rail .
Gimme that hammer . Why don 't somebody get behind her and get that whip ?
- Why don 't you ?
- Get the feathers and tar .
There 's a rail . What do you want with a rail , Jack ?
- We 're gonna run her out of town .
Why ? You know what she done ?
She told Indians- -
Well , she 's a woman , isn 't she ? Keep out of this , Bill Hickok .
And women talk a little too much sometimes .
This woman is gonna get what 's coming to her .
Let 's ride her out of town . And men talk a little too much sometimes too !
Those men had wives .
I know what 's on your minds !
Yes , there were soldiers killed .
I was there .
I saw them .
Huh ?
And they were killed with bullets- - bullets from repeating rifles .
Who 'd sell rifles to Indians ?
Lincoln said this country 's got to be made safe .
Those are his words . And I 'm on my way to settle this matter with the man who sold those rifles .
It wouldn 't please me to be the man Bill Hickok 's goin ' after .
Me neither ! I knew there was monkey business goin 'on .
You 're right . And there 's liable to be bullets flyin ' around this way any minute , so I 'd advise you to get inside , off the street .
Well- - I was goin ' home anyway .
- I 'll go with you , Jack .
- I got a long ways to go myself .
Lattimer 's " crookeder " than a rattlesnake .
You can 't go after him alone . His men- - I started this alone and I 'll finish it alone .
Why should I stake you to go diggin ' for gold ?
They found gold and plenty of it right there in the Black Hills .
That 's Sioux country .
That don 't matter . There 's gold there at the grass roots .
So , you 're goin' on the dodge , deserting ' after gold .
You know what Custer does to deserters .
I know what he 'd like to do to you .
He just got back and he 's boiling ' mad about Cheyenne Indians and repeating ' rifles .
He can 't do nothin ' .
Let him make his complaint to Washington and he 'll find that out !
The army 's gettin ' riled- - The army can 't stop me !
There 's bigger men than the army in this with me .
Mr. Lattimer .
I 'm busy , McCall .
I want to do you a big favor , Lattimer .
What 's on your mind ?
Hickok 's after you .
Wild Bill . He says you 're the cause of all these Indian massacres .
He 's comin ' in here now .
All right .
You better get out .
You won 't forget that I warned you ?
Get in there , you three .
Maybe I 'll have a job for you .
Hello , Hickok .
That 's the name , ain 't it ?
Met you in Leavenworth .
Hear you been doin' a little scouting ' for Custer .
Did you see anything ?
Yellow Hand 's been farming with your farming tools .
You know what this is ?
Skunk . Yes .
I 'm not armed , Mr. Hickok .
I 'm not armed . I 'll give you three minutes to fix that .
I 'll be waiting outside .
- I 'm just leaving town .
- You 're not leaving town unless dead men can walk .
Come in here , you fellows .
Now .
I 'm gonna stake ya , all three of you .
I 'm gonna stake you to 50 Double Eagles .
I 've got a wagon train leaving for the Black Hills tonight .
I 'm gonna get you away from Custer and safe out of town .
That 's great , Mr. Lattimer . But first , there 's that little job I want you boys to do for me .
You 're crazy .
Lattimer won 't fight you fair .
You ain 't got the sense you was born with .
Ah , Bill , don 't our love mean nothin ' to ya ?
Our love- - if that 's what you want to call it- - all that died back on that island where everything else was dying .
No , Bill , no !
I 'll go get Cody . Maybe he can talk some sense into you , ya big mule !
Get off the street .
You better take cover for a few minutes .
You think you own this town .
I 'm just walkin' through it .
And us fellas can get out of your way , can 't we , just like we was dirt ?
Suit yourself .
All right , Mr. Long Hair .
You 're too durn friendly with Injuns to suit me .
You shouldn 't have said that , soldier .
What are you gonna do about it , ya gun-totin ' windbag ?
Oh , substituting for Lattimer .
I can 't shoot at that uniform . If you want action , take it off .
Yeah , and get a slug while I 'm doin ' it .
Take it off . I 'll give you that much time .
I never draw on a man who isn 't ready .
Come on , Bill , let 's get out of here .
Sit here , Bill , out of sight .
Close that door , Lou .
Easy , Bill .
That bullet went clean through , but it 's bleedin ' bad .
Get some water , Lou , quick .
And some clean linen .
You brought this man to our house ; a murderer .
When is this going to stop ?
When will it ever stop ?
This killing and killing !
Why don 't they kill him too ?
Then you can be next and then me and- -
Lou , he 's my friend .
I didn 't mean to bother you , ma 'am .
I 'll be going .
Can I take your horse , Bill ?
You can have everything I 've got , Bill , but- -
You sit right down again , Mr. Hickok .
You can 't go bleeding like that , whatever you 've done .
He 's done plenty .
Those men were soldiers .
He 'll have every trooper of the Seventh after him now .
Get some towels , Will . I 'll be as quick as I can , Mr. Hickok .
Thank you , ma 'am .
Here you are , Lou .
There 's hot water on the stove . Hold this , Mr. Hickok .
I never was a murderer .
I never did fight unless put upon .
Thou shalt not kill .
No ghosts ever come bothering me .
It was always the other man or me ... in a fair fight .
What right have you to judge who is to live or to die ?
Put away your guns , Mr. Hickok .
I can 't do that , ma 'am , not till I find John Lattimer .
Hey , Jake , gimme some more light .
Ready , boys ? Yeah .
Which way , Mr. Lattimer ?
South , until we get out of town , then we head north .
Say , where are them three soldiers we 're takin ' ?
They 're staying in Hays City , but I 'm goin ' .
Get on your wagon .
It 's dark enough now , Bill .
You oughta head up north .
Hide out in the Black Hills .
That 's bad Indian country , but it 'll be safer for you than here .
I 'm going into town first .
You 're crazy , Bill !
I 'd be crazier if I didn 't do what I think I ought to .
Bill , open up . It 's me .
Did they hurt you much , Bill ?
I 'm all right .
I couldn 't come till it got dark .
I was scared they 'd be watchin ' me .
I know you don 't want to see me , but I gotta tell you somethin ' , Bill .
Custer 's ordered you brought in dead or alive .
The troopers have combed every hiding ' down by the river and they 're headin ' this way .
He 's goin 'to fiind Lattimer . Lattimer 's gone .
He pulled out with his wagons .
Where ?
Nobody knows .
I 'll find him .
Of course you will .
Someday you 're bound to , only don 't try to find his trail now .
Just try to save yourself from Custer 's men .
There 's no tellin ' what they 'll do .
If Lattimer 's pulled out with his wagons , those wagons are loaded .
And I know what I 've got to do .
That 's a trooper .
Hear his saber ?
Get in there , Bill , quick .
You might set the table for three , Mrs. Cody .
Who 's there ?
Courier from General Custer .
General Custer 's compliments .
How do you do , ma 'am ?
Howdy , soldier .
Hi .
What 's up ?
Custer 's been ordered to move against Sitting Bull and the Sioux up in Big Horn country .
What does General Custer want Will for ?
The General doesn 't let me in on all his secrets .
Come on , get a move on . Go ahead . I 'll be right behind you .
Grub 's ready .
Hustle them dishes .
I 'm caving ' in all over .
Light out , Bill . I 've got a pack all fixed for you and I brought a horse .
Good-bye , ma 'am , and thank you for everything .
Thanks for the coat , Bill Cody . I 'll take good care of it .
Take care of what 's inside of it , you old bushwhacker .
Will , what does General Custer want of you ?
Bill , you ain 't fit to ride far .
Why don 't you lay up someplace and take care of that arm ?
That 's what I 'll do .
I 'll need this arm when I find Lattimer .
Ah , forget it .
You ain 't got a chance against Lattimer 's men .
I 've got nothing to lose .
Nothin ' but your life !
When you talk like that , I could bounce a rock off n your bean .
Why don 't you try it next time you see me ?
When 'll that be , Bill ? Where ?
Oh , up around Deadwood someplace .
You can never tell .
I gotta get out of here too after what I done .
Well , I guess this is good-bye , eh , Bill ?
Where are you going ?
Oh , up around Deadwood someplace , I guess .
I don 't give a hoot where I go .
You 're well-named .
A child of calamity .
Always gettin ' yourself into trouble .
Bill , I reckon maybe you don 't hate me .
Do you ?
Maybe you 're just bein' nice to me because you think you won 't ever see me again .
Sure , I 'll see ya again .
This is a big country , and trails cross ... sometimes .
Thought these Big Horn Mountains was full of Indians .
Well , I ain 't seen any Indians yet , but I 'll swear to Moses there 's somethin ' followin ' us .
Git !
Want your coat back , Bill ? No .
I want some grub .
Well , how do you like your eggs ?
I like ' em very much .
You got any ?
No .
I got some jerky and a little bacon and a little coffee .
You must 've been mighty frugal over the last six weeks since you been gone .
I haven 't any grub left .
Well , you 're welcome to anything I got , Will .
I know that , Bill .
Build up a little fire and we 'll have coffee .
Given up riding ' a horse ?
Indians got it .
Mine too .
I see you got holes in your boots .
That 's from followin' a long-legged man .
Me ?
You .
What were you following ' me for ?
Did you have something you wanted to tell me ?
I reckon I did .
I thought you were off with Custer .
Custer sent me to bring you back .
Slice up some of that bacon , Bill .
Have a piece of jerky .
Thanks , Bill .
Well , I guess we got a few coffee beans left .
Enough for about two cups if we make it weak .
I ain 't seen her , Bill , for weeks .
She went home to St. Louis the day after you left .
She wanted to be with her mother when- -
And what have you decided to call it ?
I guess Lou will decide that .
Yeah . She 's a fine woman , Bill .
She fixed my arm , so I can pull a gun as quick with my left as I can with my right .
Well , that 's fine , Bill .
It might come in handy for you .
This is a hostile country .
If you get some water , we 'll get this coffee goin ' quick .
Can 't understand why Custer sent you .
He says I 'm the only man you wouldn 't kill .
Seems to me Custer 's takin' a whole lot for granted .
Well , there it is .
I have an order from the United States Army to bring you back .
So I gather .
Dead or alive .
Which way do you aim to do it ?
Alive .
No , Bill .
It 's too bad they had to send you .
I 'm sorry .
But they did , Bill .
Did you hear that ?
What 's that Indian doing with that Seventh Cavalry stuff ?
That flag 's shot to pieces .
- Where 'd you get that flag ?
That 's an officer 's coat , and there 's a bullet hole through it .
Do you understand him ?
He says Custer 's dead !
Wiped out with his whole battalion .
He says Yellow Hand 's comin ' up from the south with his Cheyenne ... to join Sitting Bull .
He says there 'll be no more white man .
If the Cheyenne reach Sitting Bull , he 's right .
Where 's the nearest regiment ?
Merritt . He 's moving up to join Crook .
You know his line of march ?
He 's coming up through Deadwood .
He says the white man friend is bringing rifles to Sitting Bull .
- That 's Lattimer .
To the new village in the canyon . That 's Deadwood .
You go for Merritt and tell him to get between Sitting Bull and the Cheyenne .
Remember , Bill , you 're my prisoner .
I 'll see ya in Deadwood .
We 'll settle it there .
- I seen it myself .
- One nugget ?
Yes , sir . !
Twenty-three ounces .
The biggest nugget I seen in Deadwood yet .
Dave , the biggest liar I 've seen in Deadwood yet is you .
I ain 't tryin' to sell you the claim .
I 'm caught .
Now , Calamity , what did you wanna do that for ?
Drinks ain 't free , Dave .
If you was a man , Calamity- - I ain 't , so plunk down four bits .
You 're a good barkeep , Calamity , but you 're awful ornery .
Hello , Calamity .
Sherry and egg .
Eggs are a dollar apiece .
I said egg and sherry .
You 'll get whiskey and egg .
Would you like to try running ' me out of this town too , Jack ?
No , Calamity .
I don 't bear you a bit of hard feeling anymore .
Well , that 's just fine .
'Cause I bear you a-plenty .
Now , say , Calamity .
You oughta be makin ' up to me .
I 'm gonna be a big man in this country .
You 'll have to grow about a foot , won 't ya ?
When I get hold of a pile of money- - which I aim to , and soon- - you 'll be treatin 'me right .
So , you staked a claim ?
Nah , not me .
Those fellas are lookin' for gold in the ground . I aim to find it on top .
If it ain 't in the ground , where is it ?
I ain 't sayin ' !
[ In Normal Voice ] I ain 't sayin ' .
All I 'm sayin ' is I 'm gonna be a big man in this Black Hills country .
Yes , sirree , a big man , like Wild Bill Hickok .
Say , whatever become of Bill ?
I couldn 't tell ya .
For all I know , he may be dead .
[ Whistling ] The man that killed him must be ridin ' high .
The man don 't live that could kill him .
Though you done your best .
You told Lattimer , Bill was looking for him in Hays City .
Hickok don 't know that , does he ?
It ain 't true .
There ain 't a word of truth in it .
Lucky for you Bill ain 't here .
You can throw this old outfit away or burn it .
I don 't think they 'll burn .
Hey . You like-a the haircut ?
No , no haircut .
Have you seen any freighting or hauling around here ?
No , no freighting . No hauling .
Everybody got a mine .
Everybody dig and a-dig .
Nobody got-a time for Tony no more .
Nobody take a bath no more !
Hey , don 't you ever put tobacco in that pipe ?
Smells like an octopus .
Hello , Jack .
What 's that army horse doin ' here ?
There ain 't been any soldiers around here in weeks , Mr. Lattimer , but the Fifth Cavalry 's comin ' in .
We 'll be gone before they get in .
My wagons oughta be here in a few minutes .
I need some barberin ' .
I ain 't seen no Indian guide .
Give him time .
Sitting Bull said he 'd send him .
Take it easy .
Mr. Lattimer .
I 'm gettin ' kinda jumpy about those wagons .
I 'll buy ya one .
That 's nice of you , Mr. Lattimer .
A drop of rye will set me up just fine .
You don 't happen to have seen any wagons going through ... loaded with farming tools ?
Now what does anybody want-a with-a farming tools ?
They got no time to farm .
Hey . Why don 't you want to get the haircut ?
Short hair makes the Indians mad , and they 're mad enough already .
Thank-a you too much .
He 's-a fine fellow .
Hello , Calamity . Ah , Bill .
Gee , you 're back .
I been watchin ' and askin' and nobody 's seen ya . Nobody 's heard .
I haven 't been out in what you call society .
I had one caller , though .
Bill Cody .
He found you , then .
Say , Bill , you didn 't- - No .
No , he 's all right .
I 'm meetin ' him here .
I 'm sure glad of that .
Wasn 't your fault , them three soldiers gettin ' killed .
Say , Bill . You won 't have to move on , will ya ?
No , I got a hunch this is gonna be my last camp .
You 're settling ' down ?
You 're gonna stay here ?
I got a feelin' I 'm gonna stay here .
Bill , you need a drink .
I been thinkin ' .
The West is gettin ' to be a new kind of place .
Bill Cody 's done the right thing . He 's changed .
What room is there gonna be for a two-gun plainsman ?
You 're talkin ' crazy .
You 're the best man in this country .
I don 't know who thinks so .
I think so , Bill .
If you think Cody done right settling ' down and all , maybe that 's what you 'd like to do .
I mean , have a home and things ... and have somebody to cook your meals for ya and- -
Doesn 't sound so bad . Oh , Bill- -
Calamity , now you gotta listen to me .
I didn 't do nothin ' , Mr. Hickok .
- I didn 't do nothin ' .
- What 's he talkin ' about ?
He sneaked and told Lattimer you was lookin ' for him back in Hays City .
She 's lying , Mr. Hickok .
She 's lying .
McCall , a year ago I 'd have shot you dead on sight .
But now- - Go buy yourself a drink .
You 're the luckiest rat alive .
I 'm beginnin ' to think Mrs. Cody was right .
Who am I to decide whether a man 's to live or die ?
You feelin' all right , Bill ?
No Injun guide yet , Jake .
No ?
Well , if you don 't mind , then I 'll go put down a drink .
All right .
Go ahead , boys . Wet your whistles .
Mr. Lattimer .
Hickok is in town .
Hickok ?
Where ?
In the Bella Union .
Get the boys back , quick .
Hey , Jake !
Mr. Lattimer wants you- - Shut up , you fool !
Lattimer . Stay in here , Calamity . Oh , Bill .
This is the only thing I have worth keeping .
If you got a wrong hunch , don 't go out there .
Don 't forget to wind it .
You 're a mule-headed man , Bill Hickok !
Get on your wagons , boys .
Just a minute . !
I wanna talk to you .
Any objections , gentlemen ?
Where you goin' with the wagons ?
Goin ' out of town .
What you got ' em loaded with ?
Buffalo hides .
You can see , can 't ya ?
Your wagons are headed north , Lattimer .
You 're not selling buffalo hides to Sitting Bull 's Indians ?
Take off the top hides .
I wanna see what 's under ' em .
NotJake .
You .
Oh . All right .
I don 't know what you 're lookin ' fer , but if you want it , you 're gonna get it .
Keep your hands off your guns , or there 'll be more dead men than this town can afford to bury .
You gentlemen also sell farming tools ?
Get on ahead of me , inside the Bella Union .
Wait a minute .
Don 't you belong to this outfit , Jack ?
Huh ?
Oh , no , Mr. Hickok .
I just know Mr. Lattimer .
You knew Mr. Lattimer , Jack .
Better get inside too .
Oh , sure .
Sure , Mr. Hickok .
Whatever you say .
- Who was that fella he shot ? - Never saw him before .
He oughta know better than to pull a gun on Bill Hickok .
Cody and the Fifth Cavalry are on their way .
Keep an eye out for ' em .
The rest of you , keep out !
[ Man ] I 'm not going to go in there .
Gentlemen , we 're gonna stay right here for a while .
What 'll it be ? Name your poison .
Jack , how about tending bar ?
We may be here for quite a long wait .
What are we waitin ' for ?
Jake , don 't reach for anything but your glass .
That goes for the rest of you .
Keep your hands away from your guns unless you want ... fiive cheap funerals in Deadwood instead of one .
We 're waiting till General Merritt gets here with the Fifth Cavalry ... and takes over Sitting Bull 's rifles .
Any objection ?
May be an hour , may be a day .
When I have to wait , I believe in entertainment .
Furthermore , I 'm short of funds .
Cards , bartender .
Find some fresh ones and some chips .
Proceed , gentlemen , over there .
You first , if it 's all the same to you .
I 'll take the one without arms .
Keep your hands on the table , all of you .
You bank .
I don 't hear no shooting ' .
It 's powerful quiet in there .
Wonder what they 're doin ' .
Best way to find out is to- -
You keep out of this !
Let Bill Hickok play his own hand .
That 's-a just what he 's a-doin ' .
He 's a-playin ' cards . Playin ' cards ?
Tony must be crazy .
- Let 's go in and find out .
- No , no . I see him so plain .
He 's a-sittin 'down with his back-a this way .
His back ?
Cut for deal .
Looks like we 're being played for suckers .
Your deal .
Any sign of the cavalry yet , Calamity ?
Not yet , Bill .
I hope my prisoner hasn 't escaped .
General Merritt , if he 's done the job he set out to do , do you think the government would be a little lenient with him ?
Mr. Cody , in matters where its sympathies are concerned , the government has been known to bend a little .
- You better not go in there .
- Bill , there 's an Injun comin ' in the door .
Hello , Charlie .
Come in .
- Charlie 's a friendly Injun .
- Yes , I know Charlie .
How many ?
Gimme two .
Three to me .
Sit over here , Charlie , where I can keep an eye on you .
Charlie took a shot at me once .
I was too far away .
Too bad you wasn 't closer .
He got my horse .
Charlie 'd been the biggest man in the West if he 'd have killed you , Hickok .
Injuns understand things like that .
Kill a big man and that makes you a big man .
Killin 'you , Hickok , is an honorjust waitin' for somebody .
You , Jake ?
Not me , Bill , not me .
I 'm facing you .
Only way to down a man like you is from the back .
Raise ya five .
Seein ' that and up five .
Get your foot off my chair , Calamity . It 's bad luck .
Don 't go against your luck , Bill .
Your say , Jake .
The soldiers ! That means a rope necktie for us !
Sit down !
We 'll play out this hand .
- All right .
- This game ain 't over yet .
It 's almost over .
Calamity , find Cody and General Merritt . Bring ' em here .
- Play your hand .
- I 'm callin 'ya , Hickok . !
Black aces and eights .
Your luck 's changed . Three queens .
I 'm afraid you lose , Hickok .
A man 's bound to lose , sooner or later .
Bill ! Let 's get outta here !
Those fellas just shot Bill Hickok !
Arrest those men !
Come on , you . Get up .
Where is he ? Where 's Bill ?
There 's your prisoner , General Merritt .
We won 't forget what Bill Hickok has done , Cody .
We 'll remember .
All of us will .
All of us .
That 's one kiss you won 't wipe off .

Team , move . Monster , stay left .
Coming out .
LIZZY : All right , who dropped ass ?
( LIZZY LAUGHING ) GRINDER :
Holy shit ! ( MEN COUGHING ) Fuck !
SUGAR : Stop splashing !
TRIPOD : Here we go .
LIZZY :
Come on , boys . GRINDER : This better be worth it !
TRIPOD : Fucking nasty . ( MEN COUGHING )
Fuck .
Shit . GRINDER :
What ? LIZZY : Where 's the fucking money ?
NECK :
Are you fucking kidding me right now ?
TRIPOD : We should check in the water .
SUGAR : What 'd she say ? TRIPOD :
Check in the water . LIZZY :
The fucking money 's gone . SUGAR : What the fuck you mean , check the water ?
TRIPOD :
Right behind you . SUGAR :
What happened with the money ?
NECK :
What do you mean there 's no fucking money ? LIZZY : Look at the rope .
MONSTER :
It 's been cut . TRIPOD :
Just check down there .
Check down here . GRINDER :
Oh , fucking shit . NECK :
Who the fuck else knew about this shit ?
MONSTER : Come on . GRINDER :
It 's not in the fucking water , man !
It 's not in the fucking water !
MONSTER : No fucking way ! GRINDER :
Who fucking cut the rope ? SUGAR : Why don 't you all just shut the fuck up and let 's go ?
Hold up , you guys .
What the fuck is that ?
Bullet . We just wasted our whole fucking career for this shit and there 's nothing here ?
SUGAR : This ain 't good . Let 's walk .
Check the water . We sold ourselves out for this .
LOU : We got a little problem .
$ 10 million is missing .
STAN : Now listen . You all did a fine job in there .
We 're not arguing that you 've got a good record with the DEA .
None of that matters right now , 'cause all we need to do is find out where that $ 10 million is .
And that 's why you 're here .
It was a big , giant fucking stack of money .
How do you know , exactly down to the dollar , how much was in that room ?
LOU : Well , the FBI was carrying on a parallel investigation .
Did you ever see the $ 200 million ?
Did you guys hear me say I want my lawyer ?
LOU : You know what would clear your ass ?
If you 'd take a polygraph .
No poly .
No poly ? That 's weak .
That 's sad .
Your ass is going to prison .
When money is supposed to be there and it goes away , and it looks like to us , it was a setup .
It may not be , and we 're going to find out .
And I know you had a friend who died .
And that 's awful , and it 's going to be more awful if it was because of money .
My friend did not die for fucking $ 10 million .
We lost a man , we lost a brother .
And you don 't give a shit about that .
LOU :
It was Wharton 's idea , wasn 't it ? You were just following the lead of a respected supervisor .
I mean , John is like your daddy .
You were doing what you had to do .
Fuck you . You don 't know my daddy .
This agency saved your ass .
You were going nowhere . You were a question mark coming in here .
And you have been better than any of us ever dreamed .
And you 've always outperformed .
We 're trying to save that career .
STAN : This is your family , Joe .
This is your family .
See , I 'm not a thief .
If that cartel finds out that you took $ 10 million , they 're going to slit your throat from ear to ear .
I gotta pee , man .
Say what ?
I gotta piss .
Then go pee . Man , he got cameras all over .
There 's no way I can go .
Oh , dude , really ?
Piss , man . What the hell ?
What you think ? I 'm not going to stick my dick where your dick been sticking in , man .
I ain 't putting it in there . Yeah , the problem is , your shit probably fit in there .
My shit don 't fit in there .
I need a thermos or some shit .
Look at this . AGENT 1 :
You threw a bottle of piss in my lap . AGENT 2 :
Man , it 's got a cap on it .
Morning , Breach .
Morning .
Hey , good morning . Oh , man , thanks , Breach !
Breakfast of champions , huh ?
Here 's your DVD , man .
Appreciate it .
And don 't piss in my bushes anymore , okay ?
I have a surveillance camera .
I see it all .
No , that was him . I 've got a bottle .
I 'm not using that bottle . I ain 't sticking my dick nowhere your dick has been , damn that .
You didn 't say that about Rebecca .
When you fuck Rebecca ?
I fuck them all .
Bro . Just follow that truck .
AGENT 2 :
So you think he did it ? AGENT 1 : I don 't know if he did it .
I just know I hear stuff , that 's all I 'm saying . They 're looking for something .
But they haven 't found anything , or else we wouldn 't be following him around like this .
Why don 't you just pull the pin on this ?
You 're never going to be able to spend that blood money anyway .
Do it for your team .
Do it for your country .
Do it for yourself .
Retire .
End it . End the pain .
Fuck you , Breacher .
I hate it as much as you do , sir .
Tactical god .
Why don 't you wash your fucking hands ?
That 's a new suit ?
Why do you rock that off-the-rack , cheap-ass JCPenney shit when you can afford Armani ?
In fact , why aren 't you on a yacht in the Caymans ?
I know what you 're trying to do .
The jabs , the jokes .
But tell them I 'm not going to bite .
What 'd you tell Smoke Jennings ' wife ?
That he died for a good cause , making you rich ?
Tell them you let me disarm you .
Give me the fucking gun .
( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Come in .
Have a seat , John .
It 's over .
I 'll go and clean out my desk .
I 'm not firing you .
The investigation is over .
No one 's been exonerated . DC just lost their appetite .
Who do you know in Washington , John ?
Got a picture of a senator fucking a goat , maybe ?
The only thing anyone in law enforcement has is their credibility .
It 's like virginity . Once it 's gone , it 's gone forever .
When did you lose yours ?
What if I gave you your team back ?
Don 't fuck with me .
No one wants you , John .
I 've got nowhere else to stick you .
Mind showing some leadership this time ?
Gun . Badge . Creds .
There you go .
You 're back in the game .
They don 't fucking let us train . They don 't let us shoot . I mean , I can 't even carry a fucking gun in here , dude .
We 're sitting on our asses , rotting .
It 's punishment , bro .
Don 't let it get in your head .
Just deal with it .
I am . Who 's winning ?
Get down .
Get the fuck out of the way !
SUGAR : In the middle of my goddamn game ! MONSTER :
Fuck me ! Country-ass motherfucker !
Why you acting all Jethro on that shit ?
You gonna play ? PYRO : We 're reduced to a fucking rubber gun squad , bro ,
I feel like a fucking parolee . Why is he tattooing a dick on your back , Pyro ?
You know what , bro , this is a fallen soldier .
Fuck you , man .
Will you fucking dial it down ? I just lost a buddy down range !
NECK : Easy , easy , killer .
( LAUGHING ) ( WHISPERS ) It does kind of look like a dick .
( ALL LAUGH ) The expert has spoken .
Bro , if I turn around and see a fucking dick in the mirror , you 're dead .
It doesn 't look like a dick .
LIZZY : Get off my ass , man !
MONSTER : You might wanna listen to this .
( GUNFIRE ON TELEVISION ) GRINDER :
It 's a fucking piece of shit . LIZZY : Fuck you .
'Cause all the company she keeps is rubbing off on her .
All the fucking piece-of-shit-ness ... Man , you need a Xanax or something .
( LAUGHS ) SUGAR : Why don 't you go home and fuck your mama again ?
( SUGAR AND MONSTER LAUGH ) Come on , man . You were slightly amusing in the field .
Here , you just suck . I will out-fight , out-fuck and out-work you on my worst day .
PYRO : See , I don 't wanna fuck you , Lizzy .
Crack whores are not my thing .
Hey ! That 's my wife , yeah ?
Bro , you bought a fucking cow when the milk was free .
Let 's do it , pussy .
Come on , let 's go bareback .
Wear a mouthpiece and head guard if you want . I 'll still fucking dismantle you !
Okay , now I want to fuck her .
Out cold , bitch !
SUGAR : She got you .
( ALL STOP TALKING ) What the fuck is going on here ?
This place looks like a fucking crack house !
You shouldn 't be here .
What are you doing here ?
The investigation is over .
We 're back in business ! NECK :
No shit ?
MONSTER :
Yes ! Whoo ! BREACHER :
Here are your credentials . Fucking finally !
LIZZY : Whoo ! Gimme !
( MONSTER LAUGHS ) SUGAR : How 'd you manage this , boss ?
NECK : Ain 't that pretty ?
( ALL CHEERING ) SUGAR : I told you !
I told you motherfuckers !
And you , put a shirt on .
NECK : Here we go .
You 're just jealous . NECK : Good to have you back , boss .
Is that a dick ?
( ALL LAUGH ) Dude !
LIZZY : It 's a self-portrait !
Where 's the fucking mirror ? GRINDER :
MONSTER :
Morning , boss .
Morning !
Boss !
MONSTER :
Morning , Daddy . Good to be back .
What took you so fucking long ?
NECK : I 'm embarrassed you don 't have decent shit .
SUGAR : Who 's got coffee ?
NECK : Knock the dust off !
Are you fucking kidding me ?
You promised you 'd use the down time to work on yourself .
I 'm fine .
( SIGHS ) Give me the weapon .
No .
I can train ... Lizzy .
Breacher . I 'm training .
Why don 't you go play daddy somewhere else , huh ?
Come on .
Slow the fuck down ! MONSTER :
Shut the fuck up !
GRINDER : Hurry the fuck up ! LIZZY :
You 're moving too fast . PYRO :
Sweetheart , shut up ! NECK :
So slow . NECK :
You need to skinny up , motherfucker . MONSTER :
Get that chicken wing out of the way .
Fucking get in your own lane .
SUGAR : Y 'all seriously taking giant-ass steps .
Give me room .
Little room . Little room !
Contact right !
SUGAR :
Hi ! We 're home !
Thank you !
SUGAR : Fuck , y 'all didn 't even stutter , man !
Slowest fucking pie I 've ever seen in my life . Whenever you 're ready !
NECK : Come on , open the door , let 's go !
Make a decision !
MONSTER : All fucking day .
Let me pie this fucking door . If there 's pussy in there , you 'd already be in there .
GRINDER :
Dead . MONSTER : It won 't kick itself .
Punch it ! GRINDER : Breaching the fucking door !
MONSTER :
What the fuck are you doing ? LIZZY :
Seriously !
Fuck you ! First in the room ? That 's the way to wait for the team there .
Very nice . Very nice .
That 's not how you fucking do it .
You going to get in my fucking way every time ?
All right , secure from exercise !
This one is down .
Yeah , I got him .
What about him ?
Fuck ! GRINDER : And who is that ?
Somebody 's got to dig that fucking corner .
MONSTER : No shit ! GRINDER :
Yeah , second guy in the room .
PYRO : It was you ! I was number three !
That 's your fucking corner ! BREACHER : Be quiet .
He 's dead ! GRINDER :
I was third one through ! Guys , shut up !
You should have dug the corner . BREACHER :
Shut up ! Shut up .
Grinder .
You have to take that corner .
You breached . You immediately turn and you go for it .
That 's your responsibility , and you cover that corner .
There 's no argument here , so let 's run it again .
Fucking asshole .
LIZZY : Told you .
BREACHER : Come on , guys .
( OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS )
PYRO : Fuck it ! Why don 't I run it by myself ?
I 'll show you fuckers how to do it ! MONSTER : Oh , fuck off !
So what happened ?
You used to be good at this .
Yeah , well , six months of finger pointing and recrimination happened .
You weren 't around . You didn 't have our backs .
Well , not by choice .
That 's your fucking excuse ?
When did you ever listen to the rules ?
We 're not a team anymore .
Just a gang .
And there is no trust .
There is no trust .
We 're going to get it back .
I know .
We 're still a family .
Yeah , I wish I could believe you .
BREACHER : So now we don 't trust each other ?
In what we do , there is only trust .
I trust you !
Each and every one of you .
With my life .
And I 'll prove it to you .
Kick the door . Kill the bad guys . Don 't kill me .
What the fuck did you say to him ?
Target !
How did we do , boss ?
Good .
Good job . I guess we don 't suck .
( SIGHS ) It 's time to do the Lord 's work .
( ALL CHEERING )
Shots !
Beers !
Come on ! All right , who 's gonna get this round ?
( ALL SHOUTING )
I 'll get the fucking round !
Why they call you Pyro , honey ? 'Cause I hooked a flashbang in a meth lab , burned down the whole fucking apartment building .
( ALL LAUGHING ) NECK : That 's why we don 't let him have the bangs no more .
You about burned my ass up , you bastard .
We call him Pyro 'cause his ass burns .
Yeah , whatever , asshole .
NECK : Get of here .
Get out of here . I would hit that .
Fuck yeah !
To Lizzy , my favorite evil bitch .
( LAUGHS ) Evil bitch !
No , fuck that !
Let 's drink to Smoke Jennings .
That motherfucker died for our sins .
Fuck yeah .
Smoke Jennings ! Smoke !
Smoke ! Smoke !
Yeah !
Smoke ! SUGAR :
This is one for the homie that can 't be here .
Smoke Jennings .
You know , we missed you .
You 're the heart and soul of us .
Don 't ever forget that .
They almost won .
It 's fucking bullshit and you know it .
We 're here , aren 't we ?
We held out as a team .
It 's just that , that thing that we did was for nothing .
Let it go .
You hear me ?
Let it go .
Okay .
You know what ? I can do this shit better than all y 'all .
( ALL CHEERING ) BOUNCER : Get the fuck off the stage !
Get the fuck off the stage !
Relax !
Let 's go , motherfucker !
( ALL SHOUTING ) PYRO :
Good night , motherfucker . NECK :
All right , let 's go . We gotta roll , we gotta roll !
Whoo ! NECK : Sorry about your bouncer , man !
LIZZY : Thanks for the lap dance ! ( GLASS SMASHES )
Fuck !
What the fuck ?
What the fuck ? No !
What the fuck ?
Fuck !
Fuck !
Miss .
Hi .
Tom worked for me .
John Wharton .
Caroline Brentwood .
Homicide . Can you help me with next of kin ?
There 's some ex-wives .
So , what happened here ?
Train versus Winnebago .
Train won .
So why is Homicide involved ?
Well , some sucker 's got to write it up .
Guess that 's me .
Anything else I can do ?
Start sweeping for body parts .
JACKSON :
Caroline , hey , I found the torso . CAROLINE :
Coming to you !
Oh , geez .
JACKSON : Look at this .
You can smell the alcohol from here .
Yeah , right .
Your man 's been drinking .
We did have a team celebration .
As soon as I get this place locked down , I need a statement from you .
You know who that is , right ?
Some Fed who thinks his shit don 't stink .
That 's John Wharton .
He 's a drug war god .
What ... He looks a little down , Darius .
Why don 't you go suck his dick ?
That ain 't right .
Well , you 're making cow eyes at him . That ain 't right .
Stripper 's here ! GRINDER : Whoo !
Ooh , yeah !
Aren 't you a little old for this shit ?
Investigator Caroline Brentwood .
I 'm looking for Eddie Jordan .
LIZZY :
Neck ! Yo !
I brought you a present .
GRINDER : Oh , shit .
( SIGHS ) Look at the water .
No , thank you .
Have a fucking drink for my friend . We buried him today .
That 's why I 'm here .
You wanna go somewhere private ?
Private ?
( ALL LAUGH ) Fuck that . This is family time .
You just get the fuck over here and make it clap for Uncle Daddy .
Look at you , got the whole FBI getup .
You got your badge .
You dumb fuck , that 's the lead investigator in Pyro 's accident . Am I right ?
It 's a fucking stripper !
LIZZY : She 's not the stripper . She 's an APD investigator .
NECK : Damn . MONSTER :
But I just want to know what the fuck you doing here right now . Well , I 'm sorry to rain on your bro down .
I just need to get a quick statement .
Neck , lawyer the fuck up !
Don 't say shit !
You know it , Sugar !
Neck hates cops because the Columbian police beat the living shit out of him for not paying a tranny .
Dude , you fucking gotta bring that up every fucking time !
I got worse PTSD from a dude in heels than anything I got in that fucking place .
LIZZY : I 'll strip for you , honey bear .
NECK : Get her , Grinder .
I 'm good , thank you .
Pull your fucking panties out of your ass , sweetheart , and take the beer .
It 's a party .
( ALL LAUGHING ) Well , since you put it like that .
I like the way you play .
Now lick it off . One step closer , I rip your fucking balls off . Whoo !
NECK : Get her , baby bird ! Get her !
Hey ! Shut the fuck up !
MONSTER :
Boss , come on !
Come on , settle down , shut up .
This is my fucking house , okay ?
She 's a guest !
MONSTER :
Guest , my ass . Come on .
Let 's go inside .
Hit that , Breach , get some !
Investigate the shit out of that .
Whose round it is ? ALL :
Pyro 's !
( LAUGHS ) I 've been chasing your man three days for a five-minute interview .
Can you do something about that ?
You some kind of a big deal ?
Yeah .
I 've been around .
I speak to him tomorrow , or I go over your head .
I will make it happen .
Your friend 's here .
I wouldn 't bother .
Tips are lousy .
CAROLINE : Liquor store 's cleared by arrest .
We present to Nichols on Tuesday . JACKSON :
No .
Suspect has taken a plea .
Who says ?
Nichols ' office .
Funny how they do that when they 're on video .
( INHALES SHARPLY ) Train versus RV . It 's ruled accidental , so I 'm thinking this is not our problem .
I just have one interview to do on that .
I 'll knock it out tonight . It 's accidental . Who cares ?
Right , so no one should interview the last guy who saw him alive ?
Perfectionist .
Breacher .
Gotta go .
Breacher .
He 's sexting me .
( CHUCKLES ) All right , man , just go .
Go ahead . Want to see ? Get out of my face with that , man .
He 's a natural blond , you know .
Get out of my face .
Oh , yeah . I don 't want to hear nothing about that .
You are dirty . Jezebel .
I 've known some cops in my time , but your people don 't seem like cops .
Good .
They 're the best undercover agents in the DEA .
Work hard , play hard , right ?
( CHUCKLES ) Look who 's talking .
You enjoy your cups .
Why do you say that ?
Your skin .
( LAUGHS ) Wow .
Wow .
Neck !
It 's me !
( FLICKS LIGHT SWITCH ) Shit , no light .
Come on .
You don 't need that .
I 'm a cautious girl .
Neck !
Wake up , you drunk fuck !
BREACHER : You got right .
Move .
CAROLINE : Clear .
BREACHER : Clear .
CAROLINE : Sorry .
BREACHER : ( WHISPERS ) Let me clear this .
BREACHER : Move .
CAROLINE : Clear . BREACHER :
Okay .
BREACHER : Where the fuck is he ?
CAROLINE : Oh , fuck !
Would you help me up , please ?
Thank you very much .
Well , we found him .
You smoke ?
Only when I find my witnesses nailed to the ceiling .
Right .
I 'm gonna leave .
No , you 're not . You 're not fucking leaving !
You 're in this now .
What are you talking about ?
I 'm a Fed .
See you .
( WHISPERS ) You 're an asshole .
FIREFIGHTER :
All right , let 's cut him down .
From a preliminary investigation , I have a cause of death . Massive hemothorax .
From a right ventricular stab wound .
This , where my finger is ...
Uh-huh . That 's how far the knife went inside his chest .
CAROLINE :
Okay . CORONER : And they gutted him like a pig .
Hey , Doc , this guy 's a trained guy . Who could walk up on a trained guy like that ?
Somebody that had better skills than he had .
He knew exactly where he was stabbing .
Boo-yah !
Got some hairs .
Not the victim 's .
Show me .
Right here .
And here 's some more .
Here . Can you bag those ?
Sure .
I 'll take them to the lab myself .
Okay .
Thanks , guys .
CORONER :
Sure .
Thanks . ASSISTANT :
You got it .
You know , in Northern Ireland , the IRA nailed snitches to the kitchen floor .
How do you know shit like that ?
Some research I was doing .
Okay , so you put out a BOLO for Lucky Charms guy . ( LAUGHS )
Hey , take a criminalist and sweep the RV 's cab .
For what ?
What am I looking for ?
Linkage .
They 're dead and we 're not .
What are we doing ? We D-up and present a hard target .
Like taking showers with full body armor .
Well , we need fucking intel .
Who 'd they send up ?
Well , who do you think , sweetheart ?
Check the board !
Could be Soto !
Could be fucking Romero !
It could be fucking ...
They could be ... ( STAMMERING ) They may be ... Fucking ...
Any of this a surprise to you ?
Just let it go , huh ?
Surprise to you , Sugar ?
I don 't really know what you 're talking about .
Guess I 'm the only one with any fucking balls here .
It 's the goddamn money .
MONSTER : Just let it go , all right ?
No !
We had to go fingering the devil 's pussy .
It 's an occupational hazard when you fight the cartels .
Oh , really ?
You see any other Feds getting smoked ?
It could happen to anyone .
Bullshit !
You believe that , chief ?
Or is that just some shit you 're spitting in case this place is bugged ?
Always assume that someone is listening .
So shut the fuck up .
I ain 't gonna fight you , boss .
Where the fuck are you going ?
Out .
I 'm bored .
You 're not going out .
It 's not safe .
They 're hunting us .
I can take care of myself .
Give me that fucking ... No !
Give that back to me .
Give that back to me ! Monster !
What 's this , huh ?
Is this chewing gum ?
Huh ? Yeah .
What the fuck you need this for ?
What the fuck do you need this for ?
( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Get out of my way .
No , Lizzy .
( LIZZY LAUGHS ) It 's the stripper .
CAROLINE : Can we talk inside ?
LIZZY : What the fuck do you want ?
Just some background information on your unit . So I can develop some suspects .
You know what we do , right ?
This special operations team ?
Well , to be honest , I have no idea . Why don 't you tell me ?
We covertly penetrate drug organizations .
I guess that would make you some enemies , huh ?
Any one come to mind ? ( BOTH LAUGH )
Any particular guy that might nail Special Agent Jordan to a ceiling ?
Are you really this stupid ?
( LAUGHS )
Ma 'am , I 'm not your friend , and I 'm not your colleague .
So don 't bully me .
Or I 'll slap you with a 48-hour jail hold . And by the looks of things , you can 't hack a day without your favorite controlled substance . So let 's keep it nice , shall we ?
And yes , assume I 'm stupid .
Paint me a picture .
Please .
I took these in Juarez .
They 're friends of mine .
And this is what the Rios-Garza cartel does to indicate that you 've pissed them off .
Sweetheart , you 're so in over your fucking head .
You need more than a Glock and sensible shoes .
MONSTER : Walk away .
Walk away .
I 'll show myself out .
Thank you for your time .
It 's our pleasure .
We 're gonna have to each get two jobs just to put him through school .
CAROLINE : Have you considered prostitution ?
Hey , what 's up ?
More black hairs .
And look . A beautiful thumbprint we got off the steering column of the RV .
It 's not the vic 's .
Boo-yeah !
Linkage .
You just said " boo-yeah . " That 's my thing .
Don 't jack my thing .
I heard the lab tech say it . ( LAUGHS )
I didn 't hear it .
Bullshit , you heard it .
Well , if she said it , she got it from me .
Due to the staging of Special Agent Jordan 's body , we believe there 's a connection to the Rios-Garza cartel .
DTO .
Rios-Garza Drug Trafficking Organization .
We don 't use the term " cartel . "
Thank you , sir .
It seems that Special Agent Roberts ' death was not an accident .
We have recovered physical evidence linking the two crime scenes .
I would like to have a copy of those files , if you could make those available for me .
Yes , sir .
Today , would that be all right ?
Yes , sir .
Thank you .
Investigator Brentwood , what exactly do you want from us ?
Well , learning about the victims helps me find the suspects .
Maybe these murders are blowback from cases they worked on .
You want access to DEA case files ?
It would help .
Are you asking for investigatory support or access to our records ?
Both .
Look , maybe there 's someone I can liaise with , someone who ...
Investigator Brentwood , your agency needs to draft a formal letter requesting assistance .
Any documents you want access to will need to be specifically cited .
Specifically cited .
What information do you need ?
Incident report numbers . File numbers .
Right .
And how are we going to know those numbers if we don 't know those numbers ?
If you don 't know really what you want , what are you doing here ?
Two murders of DEA agents have happened on my watch .
And it 's my job to investigate them , and I 'm asking for your help .
Just have the chief fire off a letter , and we 'll see what we can do .
Thank you for coming in . CAROLINE :
Have a nice day , y 'all .
Fucking US Attorney and their own general counsel ?
These guys are scared .
Hey .
You 're Brentwood , you 're Jackson , right ? BOTH :
Yeah .
You working the agent nailed to the ceiling ?
What do you know about that ?
The DEA is a dysfunctional family , all right ? No one 's going to talk family business with you .
Who are you ?
Got a card ?
Ask yourself why it happened .
Everything happens for a reason .
Think about that .
Stop leaving your shit on my seat .
That 's not mine .
It 's not some porn you 're hiding from your wife ?
That 's not mine .
It 's not mine .
You 're out here saving these adrenaline junkies that mean absolutely nothing to this department .
BREACHER : I would take a bullet for those guys .
Hmm . You 'd take a bullet . Would you take 10 million bucks ?
Would you take $ 10 million ?
Where 's the money ?
Don 't fucking scream at me !
Where 's the money ?
You dumb fuck , you !
Look at you ! With your fucking 48 % body fat . And , you , scrawny little bastard !
Fuck you guys !
LOU : Go to the gym , John .
Fucking liar .
Fucking liar !
He 's a fucking liar .
What ?
Caroline , where you going ?
Why the fuck didn 't you tell me you were under investigation for stealing from the Rios-Garza cartel ?
Get in .
I need a drink .
I need you to be straight with me , John .
No , you be straight with me .
Why do I have to find out through the grapevine that you linked the deaths of my people ?
They 're linked , I 'm sorry .
My turn . Did you steal the money ?
No .
And fuck you for asking . Don 't be such a girl .
Your agency thinks you did . So does the Rios-Garza cartel .
Why do you think they 're killing your guys ?
Spend enough time on the job , the job bites back . That 's bullshit .
You going somewhere ?
One of my guys quit the team .
He 's off the grid .
I gotta warn him .
Okay , grab your stuff and I 'll drive .
They 're going to continue to fucking kill people , and kill fucking innocent people and women and children in Mexico and the United States unless you have guys like me !
That 's a fact . Son !
Motherfucker , I quit .
Last fall , an 8-year-old girl vanished from her bed .
No leads . Only her daddy 's bullshit about hearing black voices .
And he 's a drinker .
Joins AA the week after she disappears .
He profiles , too .
Domestic abuser , all that .
And I can 't find enough for the DA to file .
Do you see where this is going ?
Just because you 're not in jail doesn 't mean you didn 't do it .
You 're awesome on a road trip , you know that ?
Yeah , I 've heard that before .
BREACHER :
That 's it , right there .
It 's beautiful .
Watch out for booby traps .
CAROLINE : Bullshit .
BREACHER : I 'm serious .
This could take your leg right off .
Here 's the trip wire .
Why is he so paranoid ?
Maybe he doesn 't want to get nailed to a ceiling .
Tripod !
McNeely ?
It 's John !
There 's something off .
Fuck .
Unit 2150 .
Send me two units and an ME to my location .
AK brass .
The guy hit the trip wire .
Right there .
Looks like he bled out .
Here , hold this .
CAROLINE :
What 's that ? BREACHER : They 're world-class assholes .
Give me the weapon .
I don 't trust you .
Well , you know , it was getting heavy anyway .
( KNOCKING ) Hey ! ( GASPS )
How you feeling ?
I 'm sorry ?
Well , now that you got sucked into our world .
They 're Kaibiles .
Kaibiles ?
Guatemalan Special Forces . Okay .
Rios-Garza Organization loves to use them for high-power hits .
You know , McNeely was a fucking Navy SEAL .
He was 10 times the operator that I 'll ever be .
What chance do you think I got ?
See , they 're the best assassins that money can buy .
Honey , I worked gangs for eight years .
Streets have rules , okay ? You steal money , doesn 't matter who you are , you can be a cop , you could be God , they will get you .
I came here to help you .
No , you did not . To help you understand .
You came here ' cause you think you 're gonna be next .
You came here to steer me , okay ?
If you want to help me , and if you don 't want to get nailed to a ceiling or run over by a train , you need to break free from your buddies and tell me something I don 't know about John Wharton .
Because I can 't read him .
Tell me something I don 't know .
Two years ago , we arrested Edgar Rios in Juarez .
He was an old-school drug lord , ran all their operations .
It was a big deal .
We 're handing him over to the Mexicans when some broad pulls her shit and dumps him .
Cartel didn 't want him debriefed by our intel people .
Problem solved .
But they had a bigger problem .
They wanted the man who can get the man that nobody can get .
John gets a call from the bad guys .
They snatched his wife and kid right out of his house on Lake Lanier .
They 're holding them in Juarez .
They make him an offer .
" Surrender yourself to the cartel and your family lives . "
John 's family is everything .
John was married forever .
His son Jacob was his best friend .
Love you , Dad .
They tortured Karen and Jacob to death .
There 's video .
Evil shit . No !
MONSTER : They mailed pieces of them to his home for weeks .
( SCREAMING ) Oh , my God !
MONSTER : So John went down there . Alone .
Hunting the man who killed his wife .
TRIPOD :
John , we 're coming in !
MONSTER : He didn 't find him .
We 're here to bring you back home .
This isn 't going to bring them back .
TRIPOD : Come on .
Let 's go home .
MONSTER : John is obsessed with finding his wife 's killer .
It 's like a cancer in his soul .
Caroline , we lost John when they died .
Go home .
Go home now .
I was just trying to help .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm so sorry .
John .
Wait up .
I didn 't know about your family .
John , I 'm sorry , I ...
Now you know .
They sent me her face .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry .
So this isn 't creepy .
Someone else get killed ?
I brought a peace offering .
Let me show you something .
Your shooters . They 're Guatemalan Special Forces .
They came in through Juarez with stolen visas .
ICE alerted , ran surveillance .
But lost them outside of Atlanta .
Now , you said you had prints . Yeah .
We got one at the RV , and one outside McNeely 's cabin . But no NCIC hits .
See if these match .
Pretty please .
ICE took them off some beer cans inside their hotel room .
Should I have these ? No .
Then why 'd you give them to me ?
I don 't want anything to happen to you .
Holy shit .
No way .
Don 't say a word .
What happened to " I 'll never date a cop " ?
Who said anything about a date ?
Evil harlot .
I can 't believe you said that .
You dirty , dirty girl .
So I got a present for you . Check that out .
Bad guys .
Dude looks like Mario from Donkey Kong . Mmm-hmm .
Who 's the metrosexual with the ... You 've got ...
Prints , records , everything .
Did he leave it on your night stand ? You don 't want to know .
( SIGHS )
Get in the car . You all right ?
'Cause you walking funny .
You 're just jealous .
Is he a big dude ?
Like , is he big ?
That 's inappropriate .
Was it good ?
Shut up .
Shut up . Is he ripped , like a six-pack ?
Shut up .
Just wondering . 'Cause he 's , like , a legend .
You 're good to go .
It 's a match .
Thank you , Tish .
Okay , I 'm going to write out a warrant-affidavit .
You put out a BOLO , armed and dangerous .
Yeah , and what you gonna tell the judge ?
That we got slipped some Secret Squirrel ICE file ?
That 's exactly what I 'm going to tell him . Once they 're in custody , we can get as many print cards as we want .
Doesn 't matter how we get there , as long as we get there .
Do we know where they are ?
Negative .
So we still got no target ?
GRINDER : What the hell are we doing sitting here ? We could be drinking beers , throwing dollars at something naked .
We 're standing by .
For what ?
Apparently , the boss got that investigator lady working for us now .
Ain 't that right , boss ?
Is that true ?
Hey . Grab a vest .
What 's up , partner ?
That ICE file your boyfriend gave you had a credit card .
I linked it to a cell phone . That cell phone is live in an apartment building .
That apartment building , Narco knows about it .
It 's a Rios-Garza safe house .
Okay , enough energy drinks , partner .
While you 've been saving mankind , I drafted an affidavit .
I sent it to the clerk , judge signed it . You 'll be needing that .
Yes , you 're right . I need that . Okay .
I 'm sorry . I was excited . Try and arrest him without it , huh ?
I got excited about it , but we gotta go kick some doors , baby .
Multi-level residential . Four units .
Brick and masonry . Fortified with barred windows .
Steel security doors .
You got an iron fence around three sides .
All right , what 's the plan , boss ?
BREACHER : ( OVER RADIO ) We blue angel up the back .
Single point dynamic entry .
Explosive breach .
We don 't know what unit they 're in , so we clear the whole structure .
All right , let 's smoke these motherfuckers and get us some dinner then .
Two mikes out .
SUGAR :
Two out , copy .
We 're at the rail road tracks .
Here we go , stand by . LIZZY :
Roger that .
We 're not here to make arrests , right ?
BREACHER : Breach !
They killed two federal agents already . They 're not fucking around !
No matter what , we all go home tonight at the end of this mission .
You know what you 're doing with that thing ?
I was in the Army .
It 's the wrong way up .
It 's not the wrong way up .
You got to rack it all the way back .
Come on .
I know how to rack a gun .
MONSTER : Heading right .
BREACHER : Keep your hands up .
Let me see your hands .
Stay right there . ( BABY CRYING )
GRINDER :
Stay on the bed , kid .
Shitty closet !
Clear !
GRINDER :
Clear ! Good !
Let 's go !
MONSTER :
Ready to go ! ( WOMAN SHUSHING )
BREACHER : Don 't stop ! GRINDER :
Going left ! LIZZY :
Right !
GRINDER : Got your back .
SUGAR :
Got a bathroom ! Clear !
All clear !
Clear .
We 're all set , boss ! BREACHER : Keep moving !
LIZZY :
Stay tight !
GRINDER : One on the couch ! LIZZY :
I got left . Put your hands up !
MONSTER : Going left , boss !
SUGAR : Closet , clear ! BREACHER :
Let me see your hands !
Anyone else in here ?
SUGAR : Coming around .
Anyone else in here ?
Just my kids .
Kids in the back !
LIZZY : There are kids . SUGAR :
Door !
LIZZY : Stay right where you are !
BREACHER : Just keep them up .
GRINDER : I got high .
Get low ! BREACHER :
Don 't move .
LIZZY : Clear . GRINDER :
Checking for mice .
Clear !
We 're clear !
Moving .
Just stay on the bed .
Stay on the bed .
SUGAR : We 're clear ! BREACHER :
Keep moving .
BREACHER : Stack up !
Okay .
Ready ?
Yup .
Door .
SUGAR : You get him !
Go , go , go . Let 's roll .
Okay , move it !
Fuck ! MONSTER : We 're tight , pop it !
LIZZY : Asshole down !
We 're clear !
LIZZY : Fuck !
BREACHER : Go ! Go !
LIZZY : Target down .
Move ! Move ! Move !
Clear !
Clear ! LIZZY :
Clear !
Sugar , let 's go .
Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Whoa ! Cálmate !
Easy ! Easy !
( SCREAMS ) LIZZY : Good kill , baby .
MONSTER : Come on !
I got the hostage . Clear !
Going right !
Clear !
LIZZY : Clear !
We 're clear ! SUGAR :
Clear !
Good fucking gunfight !
God damn !
Hello . SUGAR :
Hey , boss !
You might want to get in here !
What ?
You got your kit , babe ? MONSTER :
Right , we 're secure .
I 'm gonna ID these guys .
So which asshole are you ?
Lizzy , don 't fucking do that !
( LAUGHS ) Liquid meth ! Hell yeah !
GRINDER : You 're one fucked up bitch ! ( LAUGHS )
Yeah , it 's meth .
LIZZY : This is one for the books .
MONSTER : Breach .
It 's not them .
GRINDER : It 's not the Kaibiles ! LIZZY :
What do you mean ?
What are you talking about ? You mean we killed six motherfuckers and it ain 't them ?
Well , check again !
Okay .
No !
Still not them !
Dead man walking !
Fuck me !
Fucking shit .
Stay tight .
Behind you , brother .
All right , it 's clear .
Get EMS in here .
There 's a lot of bodies .
What the fuck are you doing here ?
It 's my job .
You used me .
SWAT TEAM LEAD : Breacher , God damn it ! What the fuck is going on here ?
Clean up , aisle three .
( LAUGHS )
God almighty !
What 's wrong ?
Son of a bitch is snagged !
Gimme a knife . I 'm gonna cut the son of a bitch .
The hell you are .
That 's a new anchor .
Damn , it is heavy , though .
Yeah , it is ! All right , keep pulling .
What the hell ?
Jesus Christ !
Stay back , son ! Turn around .
Don 't look .
CAROLINE : How 'd they die ? DOCTOR :
Looks like a gun fight .
Can you give me race and sex ?
Male Hispanics , all three . CAROLINE :
Why the chicken wire ?
As their bodies bloat , the wire cuts them , releasing the decomp gas .
They never float to the surface . JACKSON :
Yeah , great tip . I gotta remember that one .
Okay , how long they been dead ?
A week .
You sure ?
A what ?
At least a week .
If it 's the guys that we think ... They 've been dead more than a week ...
Wait , are these the ... The military guys from the cartel ?
Yeah .
You think this is them ?
The Guatemalans .
I think it 's them .
He said they 've been dead for a week .
It can 't be the Guatemalans .
CAROLINE : That 's why we need to find these tattoos .
The guy at the cabin had a tattoo on his left shoulder .
And if we have a match , then they 're part of the same gang , right ?
The killers are the victims ?
It just can 't be that , Caroline . CAROLINE :
Tattoo , left shoulder . Have we got anything ?
Ah , nice !
We got it .
Darius , come see this . This is our guy .
JACKSON : That 's it ?
Mmm-hmm .
Who the hell killed them ?
Nice .
DOCTOR : Here we go .
CAROLINE : What you got ?
Thumb 's missing . Right here .
Right .
Okay , so that explains how we got thumbprints in Roberts ' RV , huh ?
JACKSON : Looks like we 're working late .
Look , if they 've been dead a week already , right ?
They sure as hell didn 't nail Jordan to that ceiling .
Or drive Roberts over the train tracks . CAROLINE :
The Guatemalans killed Tripod McNeely , okay ?
Then somebody kills them , uses them for cover .
Come on , Darius , think about it .
Who killed the cartel hit men , sprinkles their DNA over two separate crime scenes , wants us to think they 're alive ?
Who do we like for this ? Everybody !
We like everybody for this one !
KAREN : ( ON TAPE ) John , please ! John !
BRUJO : Tell John to come for you ! John !
Tell him come for you !
John ! Come find me !
John !
Please !
Oh , no !
We had a good time , didn 't we ?
I love you , John ! ( GUNSHOT )
Who the fuck is hunting us ? LIZZY :
Who do you think , Breach ?
It 's one of us .
It 's you ! Or it 's Grinder ! Or Sugar !
Is it you , bitch ? LIZZY :
No , I keep track of the people I whack .
Neck and Pyro ain 't on the list .
See , I think that she 's right !
I think she 's fucking right . Nailed it .
So which fucker is it , huh ?
Fucking crazy ! I mean , why ?
You know why , Breach .
It was the fucking money . SUGAR :
Amen .
'Cause some of us are getting paid , and the rest of us are just getting dead .
Oh , bullshit !
Keep your hands where we can see them .
This has been fun , but I 'm out of here .
I see any of your fucking faces and I 'll kill you !
Ammo 's cheap . My life ain 't !
It 's over . LIZZY :
Where 'd you bury it , Grinder ? ( MOTORCYCLE REVS )
BREACHER : Now we fall apart ?
We scatter to the wind ? LIZZY :
Yeah , I like that idea .
Honey .
Yes , sweetheart ?
I 've been fucking Sugar .
SUGAR : What the fuck are you doing ?
That 's not what we talked about !
Look , man . Look , it is what it is , dude .
What do you want me to say ?
You want me to say I 'm sorry ?
Is it gonna make it any better ?
You fucker !
I 'm going to kill you !
Monster ! No !
I thought you were my fucking friend !
Boss , I 'm gonna kill him !
I 'm gonna fucking kill him !
Get the fuck out of here !
Why the fuck would you do that shit ?
Get the fuck out of here !
Fucking have a nice life , you fucking cunt !
You deserve each other !
I warned you .
We fucked up .
We fucked up , didn 't we ?
( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ON RADIO )
What do you want ?
Can we talk ?
We stole the money .
It was Breacher 's idea .
We thought it would make him happy .
It was $ 10 million in cash .
Went back for it that night , but when we got there , it was gone .
DEA , they wanted to throw us in a hole and throw away the hole .
Crawled up our asses with a microscope for six months .
Nobody broke .
So who has the money ?
It 's Lizzy . Or Monster or Sugar .
She 's playing one against the other .
What do you want to do ?
Fuck them all .
Let them hang .
After I lost my family , I asked myself what was I fighting for .
The answer was simple . My team .
I wanted them to get something out of all of this .
But instead , I destroyed them .
Agent Phillips is going to the DEA .
I 'm not telling you it 's gonna be okay .
Because it 's not .
Not for you .
Hey , John . Hey .
I 'm sorry .
Don 't apologize .
I would have stepped up if you didn 't .
You 're doing the right thing .
I ride this ship down .
I ride it down .
But you , you could still have a life after this .
Doing what , John ?
Where ?
This is all I do .
And it 's over .
We can protect you .
Get down !
BREACHER : Stay down .
Tell me again .
We were up the block , heard gunfire .
We made contact with a female DEA agent .
Female DEA agent ?
She left in a vehicle with a black male .
JACKSON : A DEA agent .
You heard gunfire !
Sir , she badged us . She was legit .
JACKSON : She left .
Is this the woman you saw ? Yeah .
That 's her .
You said " black male " ? Yes , sir .
A red vehicle .
Sugar .
That 's your guy , too ?
BREACHER : Clear .
What 's all this ? She 's bailing .
She 'll never make it . Every cop in Georgia 's looking for her .
She won 't get far . Yes , she will .
MONSTER : Do you think that he loves you ?
What do you think the plan is ? To just go run off and make babies ?
Well , you 're gonna be needing this .
Just give me my shit and quit fucking around .
Don 't do it ! Monster !
( GARBAGE DISPOSAL WHIRRING )
Fuck you !
Oh , fuck .
Baby , I 'm sorry !
( GROANING )
( SCREAMS ) Baby .
Oh , God .
Lay down .
I 'm sorry , Monster . I 'm sorry . ( SHUSHING )
Oh , Jesus !
Jesus !
I 'm going to kill her .
Yeah ?
LIZZY : Hey .
I fucked up .
I didn 't mean for this to happen . I don 't know what to do .
Where are you ?
Midtown .
Are you alone ? Yeah , I 'm alone .
Who would I be with ?
Can I see you ?
Meet me inside the parking structure on 4th .
Thanks , Breach .
I 'll see you soon .
That motherfucker !
Parking garage ? Mmm .
This ain 't his first rodeo .
Since he wants to be a hero , let 's give him somebody to save .
Federal agent ! Get out of the fucking car !
Did you hear me ?
Open the fucking door ! Open the fucking door !
LIZZY : Get out of the fucking car !
There she is .
Get down .
He 's down ! He 's down !
Who the fuck is that in the car ?
Shit ! ( CAR ALARM BLARING )
It 's that bitch !
BREACHER : Go , go , go !
Hold your ass , sweetie !
Here we go !
Jesus Christ !
Take the vest ! Put it on the dash and stay down !
Fuck me !
Lizzy , handle that motherfucker !
Oh , fuck !
Oh , baby , I fucked that bitch up !
Jesus Christ !
Fuck !
Get the fuck out of the way !
LIZZY : We lost them , Sug !
Oh , shit .
We 're gonna make it , baby . We 're gonna make it !
Fuck , he 's still coming !
Let 's give him a 180 !
Turn around ! Turn around ! CAROLINE :
I can 't make it !
SUGAR :
Baby , kill that motherfucker !
Fuck !
Shoot the fucking engine !
Fucking die !
Watch out !
Now , get us the fuck out of here !
I got no eyes !
I can 't see shit !
( SCREAMING ) ( BRAKES SQUEAL )
CAROLINE : Drop the weapon , Lizzy !
Okay . Okay .
Hey , Breach .
BREACHER : You killed my team .
Why , Lizzy ? Why ?
Because they stole my money !
They fucking robbed me !
After everything I put up with !
It was my money and they took it , and I couldn 't find it !
I said , " Fuck them . " ( LAUGHS )
I took the money .
I took it . You took the money ?
What does that mean ? Why ?
Mexico .
This is about fucking Mexico ?
Your family is never coming home !
What is she talking about ?
And nothing you do will ever change that ! You hear me ?
What the fuck was that ? ( SIRENS APPROACHING )
Just be a good girl and walk away .
Hey ! Hey !
( SOBBING ) What the fuck ...
I can 't .
Pull it together . You okay ? CAROLINE :
Yeah .
Okay , you hurt ?
Anything ? No , I 'm okay . All right , just take it easy .
Where 's Breacher ?
He 's right there .
Where the fuck is he ?
He was right there .
We 've got three vics .
We 've got to find him . JACKSON :
Shit !
Find Breacher ! OFFICER 1 :
You heard her , spread out !
Check the truck ! OFFICER 2 : On it .
Nothing ! I don 't see him .
I don 't see him .
What the fuck happened , Caroline ?
What the fuck did you do ?
( BREACHER SPEAKING SPANISH )
( SPEAKING SPANISH )
( SPEAKING SPANISH )
( BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH )
( SNIFFS )
( WOMAN LAUGHS ) ( BRUJO SPEAKING SPANISH )
( SPEAKING SPANISH ) ( GROANING )
You 're mine .
Your wife . I was the last to have her .
You can 't take that back .
I can take your family .
But I 'm not like you .
Hello !
Yeah , I 'm listening . But I know just exactly what you 're going to say .
What ?
Well , that 's just too bad , Mrs. Moffat .
But I happen to be running this paper and I think it was fit to print .
Good day to you .
Mrs. Moffat that time .
Stand by , Henry , for full returns .
Fifty other Lynnfield hens will be heard from yet .
This hen says , " Not fit to print . "
Yes , siree .
Hello , who is it and what ...
Yes , yes , I know , Mrs. Perry , I know .
I know you don 't like that Caroline Adams novel I 'm running serially in the Bugle .
Yeah , unmoral and not fit to print . Yes .
Yes , Mrs. Perry .
That is right .
Yes .
Now look here , Mrs. Perry , let me tell you something. I apologize .
I apologize for breaking my neck trying to buy the serial rights to the best - selling novel of the day .
I apologize for waking the town of Lynnfield out of a 20 - year sleep to show it how people live and learn and love in the wide - awake world . I apologize .
The buzzards are swooping down on us , Henry .
Yes , siree .
Hot diggety .
Say , get your nose out of that paper and answer the phone once in a while .
I want to eat some lunch .
Hello .
Yeah .
- Yeah .
Who is it ?
- Who is it ?
- Miss Lynn .
- Here , give me that .
Hello , Theodora .
No , don 't tell me you called up about that Caroline Adams story .
I 'm afraid that 's it , Jed .
Well , you 'll have to admit Caroline Adams doesn 't exactly write bedtime stories .
- Tell him it 's shocking .
- And scandalous .
Aunt Mary and Aunt Elsie simply can 't approve , Jed .
So the two Lynn oracles have spoken ?
Well , well , now , wouldn 't you think after five generations the Lynn family would be tired running this town ?
But the point is , Jed , the Literary Circle is up in arms against this book .
They 're having a meeting tonight to discuss it .
- He better be there .
- Aunt Mary said you 'd better be there .
So it 's come to that , has it ?
Yes , Jed , it 's come to that .
8 : 00 , the public library .
All right , I 'll be there .
" ' l 'd better be going home , ' Pamela said .
'lt 's late . ' Spencer smiled .
" lt seemed minutes before he answered .
" ' Home , Pamela ?
Why , it 's very early , my dear .
The night has just begun . '
" With these words uttered like caresses , he started slowly toward her .
" Pamela stood rigid , frightened , watching him advance .
" His steps were slow , deliberate .
Pamela felt imprisoned , helpless .
" She wanted to run past him out of this strange apartment down to the street .
" But her brain was reeling with drink . " Oh , my .
" She was robbed of all purpose .
" ' You 're very beautiful tonight , Pamela , ' he said .
" The words mingled with the plaintive music that filled the room .
" He was close to her . He reached out violently .
" His hands fastened on her arms and pinned them to her sides . " She was suddenly pressed tightly against him .
" He spoke in low rapid tones , words she did not hear .
" She fought desperately to break out of his grasp . " ' Let me go !
Let me go !
' " She could feel his breath on her cheek " and then his lips on hers with a shocking , terrible suddenness .
" The room suddenly went dark . "
That 's enough , Rebecca .
I think we 've heard plenty .
Well , I should think so .
If you don 't mind , I haven 't been taking the Bugle regularly and I 'd like to hear the rest of it .
You certainly don 't have to hear more than that to make up your mind about it .
Don 't worry , Miss Jenkins . You 'll get a copy .
I printed 100 extra today .
Jed Waterbury .
Well , I knew they 'd be in great demand with the womenfolk .
Well , I guess we 've agreed about one thing .
This Literary Circle isn 't going to let sexy trash like this come right into our homes and corrupt us . Now , just a second .
Just a second .
As long as I can remember , this community has had its head in the sand saying ,
" There ain 't no evil . "
Well , then that may be all right for you old people .
You 're practically dead anyhow with one foot in the grave .
The impudence . But your youngsters ought to be told what it 's all about .
You can 't keep civilization out of Lynnfield forever .
Jed Waterbury , if civilization is like Caroline Adams writes about , then it 's best that our children get along without civilization .
All right .
Theodora , what 's the Lynn family got to say about this ?
Aunt Mary and Aunt Elsie told me to tell you they want the story stopped . And if it isn 't , the Lynnfield Bugle is going to find itself without subscribers .
- l 'm sorry , Jed .
- There you are .
All in favor , say " aye . "
Aye .
Well , is that plain enough , Mr. Jed Waterbury ?
Yep , that 's plain enough .
I guess I know a righteous spanking when I get one .
All right , I 'll quit printing the thing .
Yes .
By the way , about those extra copies of the paper , come early and avoid the rush .
Well , now , one thing more .
I think it no more than right that the Lynnfield Literary Circle should go on record and tell whoever is publishing the book that this community condemns it lock , stock and barrel .
Absolutely .
In fact , I make a resolution to that effect .
- All in favor , say " aye . " - Aye .
Well , that will hold Mr. Jed Waterbury for a while .
Surely ought to .
I 'm going to New York tomorrow to visit Uncle John .
- l 'll probably see Adelaide .
- Give the lamb my love . I 'll never be done thanking you , Theodora , for getting her to New York for a change of scenery .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- lt was just too sweet of you to take such an interest in my only child .
- Good night .
- Good night .
I declare to goodness , you 're a Lynn clear through .
Just downright fine .
I 'll give you a batch of cookies to take in to Adelaide .
- All right .
- The soft ginger kind .
They won 't be all crumbs by the time they get to her .
Come to think of it , I won 't send a letter to that Stevenson publisher . I 'm going to send a telegram .
" Fewer and stronger words , " l always say .
Something like this ...
" Gentlemen , so to speak . " No .
" ln the name of decency and good morals . " No .
" This brazen filth ... "
" ... published by you is a disgrace to American morals " and a sin against American youth . "
Signed , " Rebecca Perry , President , Lynnfield Literary Circle . "
Nice going , Rebecca .
Miss Adams will just love this .
See that those contracts are ready for her to sign on the movie purchase of her book .
Yes , Mr. Stevenson .
And let me have an up - to - the - minute statement - on the sales to date . - Yes , sir .
Show her in , please , the moment she arrives .
Yes , sir .
Miss Adams .
How do you do , Miss Adams ?
- Hello .
- Well , come in , come in .
I 'm awfully glad to see you .
Seems years between visits .
Come sit down . Sit down , Miss Lynn .
- Adams .
- l 'm sorry .
But how much time do I get today ?
Well , the usual hour .
Uncle John 's expecting me .
Well , let 's sit down .
Say , I got a wire this morning that might amuse you .
Signed Rebecca Perry .
Why did you sell those serial rights to the Lynnfield Bugle ?
Have you got an aspirin ?
Well , I haven 't even heard about the Bugle .
An aspirin for Miss Adams .
But I think it 's very funny .
Very funny . Maybe you do , but I had to sit and listen to it read out loud , and I give you my word , you have no idea how indecent the stuff sounded .
- Well , shall we make it two aspirins ?
- No . Really . I suddenly realized I was a writer of wide reputation and most of it bad .
I could see Lynnfield finding out the truth .
Aunt Mary and Aunt Elsie dying of shame .
The name of Lynn disgraced forever and ...
- Your aspiring .
- Thank you. lt won 't help .
Here .
Now will you please sit down and stop worrying and let me talk to you ?
Mr. Stevenson , do you have to advertise Caroline Adams in letters that size ?
Couldn 't you make them just a little bit ...
That 's what makes the size of your bank account .
Would you like to have a look at your balance ?
Well , it couldn 't possibly interest me .
I can 't use any of it without telling where l got it .
Will you please stop worrying ?
Now , the identity of Caroline Adams will never be known .
Miss Baldwin and I will carry the secret to our graves .
Now , that ought to take care of everything , oughtn 't it ?
Everything except my own conscience .
My dear Miss Adams , don 't tell me you care what the Lynnfield Literary Circle thinks ?
I can 't help it. I 'm part of it .
I 'm part of everything in Lynnfield .
Were you raised in a small town by two maiden aunts ?
No !
Have you taught Sunday school for the past 10 years ? No !
Have you played the organ in church since you were 15 ?
No !
Well , I have .
And right now , I ask myself , where did Caroline Adams come from ?
How did all this start ?
You walked in here one day with a very promising manuscript .
Yes , I thought it was just romantic .
I must have been out of my mind .
What ? To write a book that 's sweeping the country ?
But not a clean sweep .
Heaven forbid .
What 's this ?
The first chapter of the new book ?
No .
Come on , now .
What 's in that package ?
- Cookies .
- Cookies ?
Rebecca made them .
You know Rebecca .
She loves to write telegrams .
" Fewer and stronger words , " she always says . - Will you have one ?
- No , no , no , no .
- Well , they 're awfully good .
- No .
The soft ginger kind with no crumbs .
No , no , no .
Now , where 's that chapter ?
It just won 't write , Mr. Stevenson .
I 've tried , honest I have . I still stuff rags under my door at night in case my aunts are prowling around .
But it 's no use. I 'm too upset .
The way I feel now , I 'll never write again .
Now look here . Sooner or later you 've got to be sensible and take my advice .
Have it out with Lynnfield .
Tell them all about it . Come to New York .
Get yourself an apartment and write me six more books .
- Bye - bye , Mr. Stevenson .
- Now wait a minute , we 've got some business to discuss .
- Not today. I 'm not in the mood .
- All right , all right .
But there 's one thing more , and this is very important .
I promised my wife the first time you came in , she could see you .
- You what ?
- Well , I simply had to .
- l thought we said nobody .
- Well , you see , it 's this way .
Now , she 's a rabid fan of yours .
She just wants to look at you .
First it 's a look . Then it 's questions .
Then anything could happen . No , no , no .
I swear she 'll know nothing about you .
Now look , she 's been making life miserable for me , - and you don 't know Ethel .
- l 'm sorry .
Hello .
- Well , I 'd never believe it .
- This is Ethel .
I heard you .
Don 't tell me you 're Caroline Adams ?
Well , I 've been dying to meet you .
Who 's this ? Get out of here , Michael , and shut that door .
You see , first it 's one person , then it 's two .
One thing about Michael , he only goes where he 's not invited .
- What do you want ?
- So you 're Caroline Adams ?
Say , you ought to meet me .
I 'm the man that did the cover for your book and that glorious woman on the poster .
Well , she may be glorious , but she 's certainly underdressed .
Well , that 's the way I found her in your book , lady .
Say , are you sure you 're Caroline Adams ?
What do you mean , is she sure she 's Caroline Adams ?
Well , I don 't know .
Caroline Adams ought to look as though she 'd lived . Forgive me , perhaps you 've got a terrific constitution and it doesn 't show .
All right , that 's enough , Michael .
Now , either get out or go sit down .
I 'll go sit down .
Well , there is a certain bloom of innocence in your face that surprised me , too .
What did you expect to see , the tattooed woman ?
Don 't be silly , lamb .
You know , I can 't get a word out of Arthur about you .
And I 'm just dying to know things .
- Miss Adams has to go , pet .
- Yes , Uncle John 's waiting for me .
- Whose Uncle John ?
- Her Uncle John .
- Yes , my uncle .
- l see . You 've an uncle .
Well , what about later ?
Why not take dinner with us ?
No , thank you. I couldn 't .
You see , I have to catch the first train back to ... Back home .
- Where 's that ?
- Out west .
Way out west on the range .
Come now , there are trains leaving all night long for way out west on the range .
You must take dinner with us , dear .
We 'll meet you here at 6 : 00 .
Well , I couldn 't . I didn 't bring a change of clothes .
That 's all right , we won 't dress .
Arthur , make her stay .
Well , that 's that , Miss Adams .
But we 'll put you on the earliest possible train after dinner .
- May I come to dinner , too ?
- No .
All right , but I 'll have to run now .
Goodbye , dear .
Don 't forget , 6 : 00 .
My cookies .
I 'm sorry , they 're very good .
A total of $ 3,296.33 .
Well , there 's your aunts ' income for the quarter .
Any special instructions from those two plaster saints ?
No . Just the usual check for $ 300, Uncle John .
- And put the rest away .
- Such virtue .
Tell me , dear , when are you coming to stay with me for a couple of days
- and let me show you the town ?
- Sometime soon . Not today , though .
That means never .
Still don 't approve of me , do you ?
No . Think I 'm wicked .
Believe everything those two charming sisters of mine tell you about me , don 't you ?
Confidentially , Uncle John , are you really wicked ?
Confidentially , honey , I 'm just a little short of terrific . Here .
There 's the evidence .
My gallery of playmates .
Put them all together and you have one of the most delightful careers that a man has ever carved out for himself .
Now , meet Annabelle , 1896, right down to and including Margie , 1936 .
Shocked to death , aren 't you ?
That pained expression of yours is just like Mary 's .
They 're making a fine job of you , all right .
Listen , baby .
Anyone ever call you baby ?
- No .
- Pity .
And they never will in Lynnfield .
Theodora .
Adelaide .
- How are you , darling ?
- l 'm fine .
- Mother isn 't worried or suspicious ?
- No , not a bit .
She thinks you 're working for Mrs. Jamison and that you 're so happy .
- Have you heard from Roger ?
- No .
You still don 't want to tell him ?
If his mother has frightened him away from me , I don 't want to bring him back because of this .
Of course , at the same time , I can 't let you and Uncle John go on keeping me .
Who said so ?
Why , I wouldn 't let you go .
Why , young chickens like you are a tonic to me .
Do you see ?
Run along now , take off your coat and we 'll have some tea .
By the way , your mother sent some cookies for you , but I met a hungry man and he ate them up .
You run along , dear .
You know , Theodora , this low trick you 're playing on Lynnfield tells me that there 's hope for you yet .
Of course , not much , but just a little .
- But there 's nothing low about it .
- No ? You 're only hoping to conceal it from Rebecca Perry the fact that her daughter is going to have a baby .
You lie about finding her work in New York , and you hide her away with your sinful old uncle .
Adelaide 's married .
Of course , that makes all the difference in the world , doesn 't it ?
Well , I had to do something about it .
The poor girl was frantic .
Their parents don 't know anything about her being married and that baby husband of hers going back to school .
That 's the old spirit .
And I love you for it .
And I 'm going to be proud of you yet .
Not if I can help it , Uncle .
Well , this is fine .
Here we are . Cute little place , isn 't it ?
Good evening .
Did you ever see so many hors d 'oeuvres in all your life ?
You can take all you want .
That 's the nice part about it .
Yes .
Ethel always comes here after one of her 18 - day diets .
Well , it 's a quaint little place .
Yeah , little Swedish restaurant not many people know .
I thought you 'd like it .
It 's quiet and out of the way .
- You 'd never meet a soul here you 'd know .
- That 's good .
- What was that , Arthur ?
- l was just saying that we carry the hors d 'oeuvres to the table and the rest of the meal will be served there . You were ?
I doubt that very much .
Mystery , mystery .
All I get is mystery .
I 'm dying to know something about Miss Adams , and all I get is talk behind my back .
Will you lead the way , dear ?
I must admit , you 've got me running in circles .
I thought you were a woman of 50 .
With your hair dyed , your face lifted , and ...
Cocktails , ladies ?
What 'll it be ?
Martini .
And here you are , an adorable young thing .
And your modesty , my dear .
Your girlish sweetness. I 'm baffled .
- Cocktail , Miss Adams ?
- No , thank you . None for me .
- Why not ?
- Don 't pester her , Ethel .
If she doesn 't want one , she doesn 't want one .
Two martinis , please .
Yes , sir .
They 'll be at your table .
Now , before I pass out with curiosity , tell me , don 't you ever ...
- Please , angel , please .
- Writers ' lives are very dull , Mrs. Stevenson .
Very dull. I 'm sure you 'd be disappointed .
All right , I won 't be a pest .
But you do make people curious .
- Now , Michael said ...
- He 's apt to say most anything , that fellow .
Or do anything , for that matter .
I like him , but he certainly can be most annoying .
He 's a trifle mad , isn 't he ?
Try some of this. lt 's very good .
How in the world did you know that we were here ?
Well , I said to myself , " lf l were Stevenson , and wanted to avoid Michael , " what would be the most out - of - the - way place to which I 'd go ? "
And , boom , I hit it .
First crack out of the box .
How 's everybody ?
Glad you 're on time , because I 'm pretty hungry .
And I 'm so glad you came here . I love hors d 'oeuvres .
Anybody ask you to have dinner with us ? - Not formally .
- Or informally ?
Well , in a way , no .
Well , this is the end of the line .
I guess we may as well sit down .
Lead the way to our table , Ethel .
Miss Adams .
Arthur .
- Now , let 's see .
- Wonderful food here .
It 's a wonder you can eat anything after all those cookies .
You know how it is with growing boys .
No , I don 't .
How is it with growing boys ?
You 've got me , pal .
Waiter , here and here , please .
Concoct another one of those for me , bartender .
Very well , sir .
- Wait a minute .
Not drinking ?
- No , thank you . Not drinking .
- You mean you never drink ?
- Did I say I never drink ?
But you look as though you never drank .
And for Caroline Adams , that 's very interesting .
Tell me , do you ...
That 'll do for you , Mr. Grant .
It 's no use , Michael .
I 've been working on Miss Adams half an hour .
She won 't let down her back hair .
That 's all there is to it .
I see .
But the point is , has she got any back hair ?
All this talk about drinking has made me a little thirsty , though .
- Waiter ?
- Yes , ma 'am .
Straight whiskey .
Ethel , you 're not keeping up with us .
Little Ethie feels like she 's had a drop too much .
You and Michael seem to have been drinking your dinner .
I was just showing the gentleman my back hair .
Would you say it was down now , Mr. Grant ?
Well , I wouldn 't say it wasn 't .
Hadn 't we better start thinking about your train now , Caroline ?
That 's right , Arthur .
You keep me posted now . Keep me posted .
- Check , please .
- Yes , sir .
Say , did I hear you say you never danced ?
Who , me ?
Well , you certainly didn 't .
I know a hot little night spot that 's just opened uptown .
- You do ?
- That is if you go to that sort of place .
- Well , I write about them , don 't I ?
- That 's right , you do .
In fact , when I hear about a new hot spot , I 'm like an old fire horse and the bell .
No .
You know , talking about fire horses , I haven 't seen a fire horse since I was a kid .
Well , my dear fellow , you 're missing something .
- We still have them up in our town . - Where 's that ?
Wouldn 't he like to know ?
It 's train time now , Caroline .
Let 's go .
There is another train in about two hours .
Let 's just take a peek at this night spot .
Come on , Arthur .
Come on , Ethel , make him .
Well , I 'm not feeling my best , but I started all this and I 'm going to finish it .
Here you go .
- Let 's go . Come on .
- Pure accident .
Come on , let 's go .
How are you doing , Caroline ?
I 'm flying .
I 'm floating on a breeze .
Pure accident .
That was no accident , lady , that was my foot .
Michael was right .
She 's got a terrific constitution and it doesn 't show .
Little Goldilocks drank me right under the table .
- l 'm passing out , lamb .
- Here , here , dear .
Now , don 't do anything like that .
We 've got to put Caroline on that train .
Mama 's big boy better get little Ethie out of here right now .
Now , be sensible , pet .
We can 't leave Caroline here like this .
We 've got to put her on that train .
I know , way out west somewhere .
Michael will put her on the range .
Ducky , better get little Ethie out of here while she can still walk .
Here , take my arm .
I wish I knew what started all this .
Come on , dear .
Now be careful , be careful .
You 're one of those clever fellows , aren 't you ?
That 's what they all say .
Had your mind all made up about me , didn 't you ?
Thought I didn 't drink .
Thought I didn 't dance , too .
Pure accident .
Here we are , my dear .
My own little nest .
Aren 't you coming in ?
Naturally .
What a lovely place , Michael .
It 's so inspiring .
Coming from an expert , that 's something .
You mean me ?
Yes. I was referring to the apartment you wrote about .
You know , what 's - his - name 's place where Pamela was lured .
Yes .
Poor little Pamela .
Are these your etchings ?
Poor things , but my own .
Here 's my latest , most ambitious work .
Almost finished .
Eve and the serpent .
Charming .
Perfectly charming .
Shall I take your coat ?
Aren 't you going to stay for a while ?
Naturally .
- Perhaps you don 't want to stay ?
I don 't know .
This hour of the night , bachelor apartment .
You 're still full of peculiar notions about me , aren 't you ?
Some soft music would be nice , don 't you think ?
As a matter of fact , it 's been playing the whole time .
Well , it 's charming .
Perfectly charming .
Drink ?
Yes. I was just going to suggest that .
Scotch ?
Scotch .
I thought you were going to get the drink ?
Maybe I 'd better go .
I guess it is getting pretty late .
Late ?
Why the evening 's just begun , darling .
Did I tell you how beautiful you look tonight , Caroline ? No .
Well , you do .
You 're adorable .
Don 't you dare .
Don 't you dare !
You stay right where you are .
If you come one more step , I 'll scream .
I 'll scream .
Do you hear me ? You keep away from me .
Let me get my things and my ticket home .
You keep away from me .
I 'll get a policeman after you .
I will. I 'll get a policeman .
You stay where you are .
You stay where you are .
Want to stop in for a snack , Rebecca ?
Why , I don 't mind if I do .
I hope Adelaide ain 't keeping late hours or traipsing around the city all by herself .
No . She 's at home with her work most of the time .
Reading to Mrs. Jamison .
She never goes out , except when ...
Except what ?
- What ?
- She never goes out , except ...
Except when she goes out .
That don 't make sense , Theodora .
He looks like a stranger to me .
Nice day of the week to be whistling a jig on the streets .
Looks a lot too happy for Sunday , if you ask me .
Of course , now and then she takes a ride in the park with Mrs. Jamison .
- Who does ?
- Adelaide .
Yes , Adelaide .
I wonder if she hears from Roger Taylor .
Or did she get all that nonsense out of her head ?
Brazen - looking , isn 't he ?
About time we were discussing this year 's charity bazaar , Rebecca .
I was going to say .
If it 's going to be a success , I guess it 's kind of up to the Lynns again .
- lt usually is .
- Well , we haven 't shirked any duty yet .
Look out , child . You 're going to drop that cup .
What 's gotten ...
Him again ?
- Yes .
- Walking by ?
No , just sort of resting on the gate .
I 'll phone Captain O 'Donnell and have him put that good - for - nothing loafer in jail , where he can whistle to his heart 's content .
No , don 't bother , Aunt Mary .
I 'll tell him to go away .
Don 't get too close to him .
How do you do , lady ? Right smart weather we 're having .
You get away from here and leave town as fast as you can .
is that the way to greet an old friend ?
An old drinking companion ?
You listen to me . My two aunts and the worst gossip in town are watching us .
As far as they 're concerned , I don 't know a soul outside of Lynnfield .
And if they suspected what you know about me , they 'd have fits .
Now , be a nice man , tip your hat politely and get away from here . Marvelous .
This beats my first guess by a mile .
Will you please go ?
Yep .
That 's a mighty fine homestead you got there , lady .
Of course , your lawn looks a bit seedy . And that vine needs training .
You know what you need , lady ?
A gardener .
- Don 't be absurd .
We never had one .
- Lady , you 've got one .
Now listen to me. lt simply can 't be done .
I can start right now .
What 's this all about ?
Why don 't he go along ?
What does he want ?
I 'm looking for work , ma 'am .
Work !
He 's a gardener , Auntie .
He says he needs work .
Not interested .
Well , you ought to be , ma 'am .
Your garden looks pretty bad to me .
I don 't care how it looks to you .
Don 't stand there arguing at the top of your voice , young man. lt 's Sunday .
Just go along about your business .
Yes , go along .
Go along .
I 'm a very willing worker , ma 'am !
Quiet !
I just said we don 't want the garden touched , and if we did , we wouldn 't hire a stranger we found loafing on our doorstep .
You got me all wrong , ma 'am . I ain 't no loafer at heart .
I was just telling the little lady here something of my life 's story .
Well , you can 't shout your life 's story out there on the street .
You 're quite right , ma 'am. I 'll come in .
- Here , here , doggie .
- No , no .
That 's a friend of mine . I just picked him up .
Nice character .
A little down on his luck , so we decided to throw in together .
- l suppose he gardens , too .
- Yeah , just with his front feet .
- My name is Theodora Lynn .
- Yes , ma 'am .
- And wipe your feet .
- lt ain 't raining .
Wipe them anyway .
It 's always done in Lynnfield .
Yes , ma 'am .
- Now look here , young man .
- Keep your dog out of here .
If he as much as growls at Sylvia ...
Come here , Jake .
Get him away from here .
Sit down .
My name 's Dewberry , ma 'am .
Young man , you 're wasting your time .
I see , so you 're refusing work to a man who needs it , who 's willing to work .
A man who wants a chance to get back his self - respect .
That isn 't very charitable - minded , is it ?
We 're as charitable - minded as the rest , young man .
Our acts speak for themselves , Elsie .
That isn 't the point .
Well , it seems to me it is .
But don 't worry , I 'll find work .
I 'll find it in this town , too .
And I 'll have a lot to say about how people are treated in this house .
In fact , I 'll have a lot to say about a lot of things .
I suppose it 's our fault that we can 't find work for anybody who comes to the door .
- There is some work to do , Aunt Mary .
- What work ?
Well , cleaning up and sort of straightening around the garden .
Exactly . Thank you , lady .
That 's what I call intelligent charity .
I 'll just give him that room in the tool house .
This way , please .
Come on , Jake .
This way .
Well , if that don 't beat all .
Elsie , we can 't leave Theodora alone with a man like that .
Well , of all the brassy , young no - accounts .
Why , I don 't know what Theodora can be thinking about giving him work .
He 'll be out of here before we can say Jack Robinson .
So I don 't see any reason to mention this around town , Rebecca .
Me ?
Lands , no .
Why , there 's nothing to mention .
I guess Theodora was just sorry for him . That 's all .
Of course , he was sort of good - looking and young .
Lands , I wouldn 't say a word .
Say , this is fine .
I 'm going to be very happy here .
I 'll just sweep up , Aunt Elsie , while you get some sheets and a blanket from the house .
We 'll get those things later .
I 'll wait while you sweep up .
Yes , sir , this is what I call surroundings .
The kind of a place that moves people to write .
Suppose you do your own sweeping .
It might save time , Aunt Elsie , if you got the things now .
- There 's no hurry .
- Go ahead and get whatever it is , Elsie .
- Aunt Mary .
- Go with your aunt .
- Say , this place is crawling with aunts .
- Where ?
Sorry , lady . My mistake .
Come here , Jake .
Come on .
There , with the compliments of Sylvia .
- There , he just put his light out .
- l wish he 'd put his whistle out .
I guess we can all go to sleep now .
You can go to sleep if you like .
I 'm going to sit right down here all this blessed night .
If I 'm going to be robbed , at least I 've got the right to know about it .
I can 't think whatever possessed you , Theodora .
Well , he looked so pathetic .
Nothing pathetic about a strange loafer .
Now , you just let him putter around tomorrow and then he goes right on his way .
He 'd better stop that infernal tooting .
If he doesn 't , it 'll drive me crazy .
Want some coffee , Auntie ?
No , thank you .
You haven 't eaten a thing .
Isn 't your head any better , Aunt Mary ?
Worse .
That lawn mower never made so much noise before .
Well , I guess nobody ever pushed it so fast before .
You have to admit he 's a very willing worker .
He ought to do something after the breakfast he ate .
Two helpings of oatmeal , four eggs , and a rasher of bacon , coffee .
And then he says , " What ?
No waffles , Elsie ? "
" Elsie " he calls me !
And I call him too altogether downright familiar .
Any more of his sass ...
Get along , little doggie , get along , get along
Get along , little doggie , get along
Get along , little doggie
Good morning , neighbors .
Good morning . Morning , ma 'am .
Get along , little doggie , get along
Howdy , squire .
Howdy .
Howdy . Morning , ma 'am .
My , my , well , dog my cats , that 's a mighty pretty hat you got on .
Looks like an heirloom . Get along , little doggie , get along
Turn around , little doggie Turn around , turn around
This is the end .
Half of Lynnfield 's marching by to see that lunatic .
No , Rebecca wasn 't going to say a word .
- Well , I 'll settle him .
- l 'll go , Aunt Mary. I 'll go .
I think maybe I can manage him .
Get along , get along , get along , little ...
- Morning , miss .
- What do you think you 're doing ?
You can 't stage a circus out here in this front yard .
Well , I can 't disappoint all these people who 've walked blocks just to look me over , can I ?
Well , you 've given them more now than they expected .
So unhitch that barking horse and stop this nonsense .
I hope you 've learned your lesson , Jake .
It 's a disgrace to have a little fun in Lynnfield and don 't you forget it .
- Good morning , Mrs. Cobb .
- Good morning , Mrs. Cobb .
My , my , you 've put on weight .
That 's about enough from you , Mr. Dewberry .
You and I are going in the back and trim the rose bushes , understand ?
Okay , lady .
Giddyup , Jake .
Giddyup .
Keep your hands busy and your eyes on your work .
And tell me , how did you track me to Lynnfield ?
- Homing instinct , like a pigeon .
- Tell me .
You left some papers on the floor in your wild flight from my apartment .
- Pure accident .
- l see .
Well , now that you know everything and you 've had your little laugh , why don 't you get along ?
It fascinates me .
Why don 't you get away from this burg and lead a natural life ?
I 'm happy right where l am .
No quaking rabbit was every happy .
And for a lovely woman with talent , it 's a sin .
Don 't worry , lady , I 'm going to break you out of this jail and give you to the world .
You wouldn 't be so low as to tell my aunts and Lynnfield about me ?
- No , you 're going to do that yourself .
- Never .
That 's the old Lynnfield spirit .
And tell me , what kind of berries are ripe this time of year ? Blackberries .
Why ?
That 's what you and I are going to pick tomorrow .
Don 't be silly. I can 't go skipping off to the woods with you .
It 's the berries tomorrow .
What are you doing ?
Who told you to take up that rose bush ?
You 're a gardener , are you ?
Well , you 're dismissed .
You 've got your notice right now .
Now , Aunt Mary , you can 't do that .
I told him to dig it up .
- Why ?
- Well , I thought maybe ...
Well , she was just saying it ought to be transplanted .
And I was just saying as how transplanting is very important .
You see , it 's this way , Aunt Maria .
If you keep a rose bush in one place too long , it uses up all the nourishment in that one little spot of ground .
And what happens ?
It stops growing .
Settles down to a dull existence .
And it 's the same way with most people .
What they need occasionally is new soil with new life in it .
- Hey , Jake !
- Sylvia !
Sylvia !
I thought you said you were a berry - picker ?
And no cracks , you .
I 'm just not used to bending over , that 's all .
You 're a wreck , Mr. Dewberry .
- You know what you need ? - No , what ?
You need nourishment , new soil , transplanting .
You 're a nasty character .
Excuse me , I 'm tired .
Well , what about some berries ?
Well , they 're right at your head .
Dig in . Drop them in my mouth .
Well , who 's going to chew them for you ?
Drop them way back so they 'll just slide down .
Sorry I have to trouble you to swallow .
That 's all right .
- More .
- Want some more ?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself laughing like that , right out loud and everything .
What would Lynnfield say ?
Say , has anybody ever been known to laugh in Lynnfield ?
I think there is a case or two on record .
Well , then somebody must have been tickling them .
You know , you 're a strange , sad case , girlie .
Do you know that ?
No .
No , tell me , doctor .
Well , to begin with , you 're really a nice gal .
Full of normal desires , but I can tell you what 's happening to them .
- What ?
- They 're being slowly strangled to death .
- Why , that 's murder .
- No , suicide .
Everything Lynnfield doesn 't want you to feel you write about .
Love , laughter , all the things you want to experience and can 't .
Go on .
There 's a happy world out yonder , girlie .
Break loose , be yourself .
Tell Lynnfield to go take a jump .
Can you imagine Aunt Mary taking a jump ?
Well , it 's the only way you 'll ever be a free happy soul .
Mind the old doctor. I know .
I had to go through the same thing .
Sure is tough to break away from your family , your background and be yourself .
They had it all fixed for me to settle down in Papa 's footsteps .
To be a banker and a statesman , but I wanted to paint . It was the battle of the century , but I won it .
I knew you would .
Yeah ?
Well , at least I can call my soul my own .
Do you ? No .
No , I don 't. I really don 't .
But I could with a little help from you , doctor .
Just say the word , girlie .
What do you want me to do ?
I want you to get out of Lynnfield and stay out .
Then I 'd be free and happy .
You see , Dr. Dewberry , - my real life is right here .
- Yeah ?
Caroline Adams was just an accident .
Pure accident .
She won 't write any more .
But , if anything should go wrong , I 'd be glad to call on you , doctor .
Your bedside manner is so charming .
I do appreciate it .
Listen , it 's getting late and I have to help with dinner .
Come on , grandpop , we 've got to go .
Wipe off your face .
Come on , Jake .
- Goodbye . - Now , wait a minute . You may win as a berry - picker , but wait until we go fishing and then I 'll show you a thing or two .
Wait till who goes fishing ?
I thought I told you to leave .
Sure , sure , I 'll leave .
Now , let 's see , the best time to go fishing is about 5 : 00 in the morning .
What we catch , we 'll eat for breakfast .
Listen , I 'll have a hard enough time explaining this berry - picking .
You 'd have a harder time explaining about Caroline Adams , wouldn 't you ?
Shall we make it 4 : 30 ?
Now , then , just relax .
You 'll never catch trout if you 're too anxious .
They can tell an amateur a mile off .
Now then , casting is an art .
You want your bait to describe a wide arc and settle down gently on the water .
If you make a splash , you scare them away .
Well , here goes .
Now then , you watch closely .
You didn 't catch anything .
Well , you don 't catch a trout every time you cast , little girl . Have a try .
You mean like that ?
That makes five for me .
You haven 't caught any yet , have you , Michael ?
You know darn well l haven 't .
Why didn 't you tell me you were a crack fisherman ?
Well , you didn 't give me a chance .
You were so busy telling me how good you were .
I don 't think we ought to catch any more than we can eat , do you ?
- Want to have breakfast now ?
- lf you 'll invite me .
They 're your fish .
Come on .
You 're invited .
Come on , Jake .
- Come on , boy , get your breakfast .
- Hello , Jake . Hello , boy .
Do you like fish , Jake ?
Come on , boy .
When are you leaving town , Michael ?
You know , I can really relax on fish .
It sits just right .
Not too heavy and not too light .
That rhymes . Not too heavy , not too light .
Eat more fish .
Sits just right .
When are you leaving town ?
- You said that .
- But you didn 't answer me .
Well , to be serious about it , I don 't know .
Well , when do you think ?
Can 't think on fish .
I inherit that from my grandpa .
Michael , stop poking at that fire .
Hey , what do you think you 're doing ?
I 'm the Boy Scout here .
My eyes .
- Here , you goop .
- l 'm blind .
Well , it serves you right . Don 't you know any better
- than to go playing with fire ?
- Keep still , it hurts .
So would your finger if you stuck it in a buzz saw . It hurts something awful .
All right , all right .
Don 't cry now . Don 't cry .
Papa will make it all better for you .
Now , wait a minute . Wait a minute .
See ? All better ?
Michael , I forgot it was Sunday .
Miss Wilson , you look after the sale of tickets .
Mrs. Moffat will have charge of the refreshments .
And Mrs. Cobb will take charge of the clothing booth .
I 'll manage the raffle .
- Rebecca , you will ...
- l know .
Well , I guess there is only one more thing to discuss .
That 's what day we 'll have our bazaar .
But before we go into that , I think we 'll have our tea and cake .
- Theodora .
- Yes , Aunt Mary .
Well , if you ask me , Mary , there 's just one thing to discuss at this meeting .
That is the conduct of Theodora .
Rebecca , and all of you ,
Theodora might make a few little mistakes out of a generous impulse , but she couldn 't do anything sinful .
You know that , because you 've known her since she was a child .
So I won 't have any aspersions cast .
is that plain ?
That isn 't a true hexagon .
By the way , our gardener is leaving in the morning .
- Michael .
- Well , come in .
I 'm washing out my only shirt .
Come in .
No , I can 't. I 've got to get back .
I just came over to say that ...
What 's he doing ?
Who , Jake ?
He 's after the cheese in the mousetrap .
You came over to say what ?
That you 've got to leave , Michael .
I promised you 'd go in the morning .
There was a quarrel about it yesterday . It 's really serious .
We can 't joke about it anymore . You 've simply got to go .
- Hey , Jake .
Jake . Come here , you fool .
- Jake .
Come here .
Come here , and let me take your foot out .
Come here , Jake .
Come here .
Oh , Jake .
Come here and let me take your foot out .
Haven 't you got any more sense than to go stick your foot in a mousetrap ?
I don 't think it 's broken any . There .
Shall we go on with the meeting ?
We 're waiting for the tea , Theodora .
Theodora .
Well , why don 't you ask me what you want to know and get it over with ?
Did I go out there because I heard the dog yipping ?
Or did I go out in the first place to see the gardener ?
The tea , Theodora .
You 've all made up your minds about it anyhow , so I may as well tell you the truth .
I went out there to see him .
To tell him that I don 't want him to go .
But he 's got to go because you want him to . - Theodora .
- lt doesn 't matter what I want .
You 're telling me what 's good for me , what 's proper , what isn 't proper .
You have been telling me that since I was three years old and I 'm sick of it .
You 've glared and scolded and frightened me all I 'll stand for .
And now I 'll tell you something .
I 'll tell you something you 'll never forget .
There 's no law that can put that gardener off these premises .
And he 's going to stay right here .
This is a free country , I said .
I 'm over 21 , and what I choose to do is none of Lynnfield 's business .
I invite the whole town to take a jump in the lake .
Swell .
That gardener 's going to stay here as long as I want him to , I said .
And that 's forever , because I love him .
What 's Lynnfield going to do about that ?
I love him. I always will .
And there 's nobody in this town who 's going to stop me .
Swell .
That 's what I said , Michael .
It was the truth .
Swell .
I was thrilled to hear myself say it .
Right then I knew I never could have sent you away .
Well , when you finally did let go , you certainly rocked the world , didn 't you ?
I guess you and I have a lot of things to talk about .
Yes , I guess we have .
We 'd better not start tonight , though .
Are you proud of me , Michael ?
I 'll tell the world , baby .
Baby ?
And Uncle John said nobody in Lynnfield would ever call me baby .
Good night , darling .
Michael .
Michael .
What ?
What ?
- 10 : 00 , Mr. Grant .
- 10 : 00 ?
Well , what of it ?
You know I didn 't get to bed until 4 : 00 .
Get out of here .
Your father telephone .
Say he be here at 10 : 00 .
My father ?
Well , why didn 't you wake me up ?
I wake you , but you don 't wake .
- Did you straighten up the living room ?
- All fixed . There he is now .
Always on the dot .
Let him in , Toki .
Hello .
- Theodora .
- Hello , Michael .
Hello , Jake .
Well , here , let 's do something about this .
Toki .
Toki , take him out in the kitchen and give him a bone .
Have you got a bone ?
No bone , but got nice lemon pie .
You forgot Jake. I thought you 'd want him .
Why , yes , of course I want him .
Thanks very much .
And you want to know why I left that note and ran away .
Theodora , writing that note was the most difficult thing I ever did .
Oh , yes , the note .
I know you 've got an explanation coming .
I ran away , because ...
Because I threw myself at your head and you were frightened .
No . Because I felt the same way about you .
You didn 't know that , did you ?
I didn 't know it , either , until that night .
Until you stood there in my arms .
Then I knew I loved you .
If I 'd had any idea that it was ever going to be as serious as this , I never would have gone to Lynnfield .
In view of my circumstances , I had no right to go playing at hearts with a swell person like you .
What circumstances , Michael ?
Mr. Grant ?
Yes , you can come right up .
There he is now . Please , I 'd rather you didn 't stay .
He can be a little difficult about some things .
Be a good girl now , run along to the Ritz and I 'll meet you there at 1 : 00 for lunch .
The Ritz ?
Where 's the Ritz ?
You mean to say you don 't know where the Ritz is ?
Well , now , if you came to Lynnfield and I said to meet me in Willoughby 's Meadow for berry - picking , you 'd be a little confused , wouldn 't you ?
Theodora , you 're stalling .
Why , Michael Grant , I 'm not stalling .
Listen , do you know what avenue you 're on now ?
No , I don 't . Tell me about it .
Well , you 're on Park Avenue ...
How 'd you get here if you didn 't know ?
Oh , homing instinct . Like a pigeon .
Now , please listen , Theodora .
You go right down Park Avenue , then you turn to the right until you come to Madison .
Oh , never mind. lt 's too late .
Will you please go in another room or go sit down some place ?
I 'll go sit down some place .
- Hello , Father .
- Michael .
- Hello .
- Agnes .
Hello. I wasn 't expecting you .
You disappoint me , Michael .
Running out of town without telling your family anything about it .
Where were you ?
Who 's this ?
Miss Lynn from the Stevenson Office .
She 's brought material for drawings that I 'm to make .
My father , Miss Lynn .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do , Mr. Grant ?
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
I 'm Mrs. Grant .
Oh , yes .
My wife , Miss Lynn .
Where did you say you were ?
- ln the country , sketching .
- Very pretty .
He will sketch .
Did you drift back to town accidentally , or did you remember that I 'm giving a reception for the governor on the 20th ?
Of course I remembered .
And of course you 'll be there with Agnes .
- With Agnes ?
- With Agnes . Now , look here , Father , this pretense of a happy marriage has gone on long enough .
It 's been washed up for five years , and I 'm sure Agnes is just as sick of it as I am .
If not sicker .
I thought it was agreed there would be no divorce as long as I held public office .
If Agnes is agreeable , I don 't know what you 're kicking about . - Yes , I appreciate ...
- You gave me your word .
And that 's the way it 's going to be .
You owe that much to the name of Grant .
Especially after your choice of a profession .
Now , you know what 's expected of you , Michael .
Come , Agnes .
- Good day , miss .
- Oh , goodbye .
I can scarcely wait for the governor 's reception , dear .
- Toki , bring me some coffee , black .
- Got some nice lemon pie .
Well , it 's all clear now , isn 't it ?
You know something , Michael ?
What you need is an artist 's model .
- A what ? - An artist 's model .
Why , I haven 't the slightest use for a model .
Well , the right one might be a great help to you .
- l don 't want a model .
- Don 't struggle , Michael , you 've got one .
- Who ?
- Me .
- What in heaven 's name for ?
- What for ?
Certainly what for ?
Well , to mow the lawn , transplant things , a little plain and fancy whistling , you know ...
Oh , I see. lt 's a joke .
That 's very funny .
You mean I did some gardening for you and so you 're ...
Yes , I 'm going to return the favor and do a little modeling for you .
- That 's very funny .
- You see , you 're living in a jail , too .
- You can 't call your soul your own .
- Oh , come now .
Why , it 's true .
Why , you 're a clear sad case , my boy .
Tied to a woman you don 't love .
And so afraid of Papa you can 't do anything about it . Now , wait a minute .
If you are trying to find any similarity between your situation and mine , oh , no , you couldn 't mean that , really .
- Finally , your whole outlook was wrong .
- And yours ? Mine ?
Well , I 'm simply in a position where ...
Well , I was brought up with pride of family , that 's all , - to respect the old boy . - l see .
And you love me , Michael ?
You know I do. I meant every word I said .
And when I 'm free , darling , the world is ours .
And when will the world be ours , about ?
Well , just give Pop time to serve his term as Lieutenant Governor .
He won 't run for office again , I 'm sure . That means that within two years ...
Michael !
Two years for people of our age is a lifetime .
Oh , no. lt may seem that way , Theodora ...
Why , it 's true. lt 's right .
Why , if you had any courage , if your outlook were right , why , you could ...
My , how you need a model .
Here , wait a minute , Theodora .
Will you please discuss this with me like a normal human being ?
- Well , just a moment , please .
- What are you going to do ?
Hello , those boxes and things that were left in the foyer downstairs .
Will you please send them up to Mr. Michael Grant 's apartment ?
What boxes ?
What things ?
Some new outfits I just bought .
Wait till you see them . I 've got hats .
They sit on an angle like this , I 'm telling you .
And dresses , I 'm an open secret down to there .
Where 's your tool house ?
Theodora , exactly what do you think you 're going to do ?
I 'm just returning a favor , darling .
How ?
By moving in here and breaking a scandal around my ears ?
Oh , a scandal is all in the life of a model .
Theodora , either you 're mad , or you 're fooling .
Listen to me . I 'm going to handle this in my own way .
If it takes two years , it 'll take two years .
You 're not going to force a situation between me and my father and Agnes by moving into this apartment .
Oh , I 'm in .
Oh , come in , boys , come right in .
Come right in , boys .
Put them down any place .
Any place at all .
My , my ! I didn 't ...
Oh , it 's nice of you to come up .
Would you put it down there ?
Oh , you 're in , huh ?
You 're going to have things your own way ?
Well , we 'll see about that .
Toki , Miss Lynn is in .
Pack up my things. I 'm out .
Why ...
- Yes ?
- Miss Adams .
Miss Caroline Adams .
Yes , yes , of course .
How are you , my dear ?
Fine .
Your mouth 's open , Arthur .
Oh , I 'm fine , too , thanks .
You might say , " ln the pink . "
You can tell that , can 't you ?
It cost enough .
But I didn 't come here to have a friendly visit . I came here to have a fight .
I 'm dissatisfied with the treatment I 'm getting from my publisher. I mean you .
In short , why don 't I get any publicity around here ?
- Why , my dear Miss Adams ...
- My dear Miss Adams .
My dear Miss Adams .
Yes , you sit there and call me Miss Adams .
But who else knows I 'm Caroline Adams ?
Nobody .
The widest - selling author in the country and nobody knows anything about me .
Has it never occurred to you that the sale of my books might jump enormously if it were known that I 'm fairly young and modern and halfway respectable ?
And if the facts were broadcast about my life in Lynnfield , don 't you realize what a story that would make ? - Well ...
- No .
No , obviously not .
It seems publishers don 't care anything about increasing the sale of their books .
Well , authors do . We 've got to live .
A thing like this is darn expensive .
Now , I 'll give you one more chance , Mr. Stevenson Publishing Company .
I want publicity. I want a lot of it .
I want my picture on every jacket of every book of mine that 's sold .
And I want the story of Theodora Lynn and Caroline Adams splattered over every paper in every town in the Union .
Will you come in , please , Miss Baldwin ?
And bring your book .
And , oh , one aspirin for Mr. Stevenson .
Or shall we make it two ?
Holy smoke !
Hello .
Hello . Bertha .
Get me the Bugle .
Hurry up .
Jed ? Jed , listen .
Associated Press dispatch to Lynnfield Bugle .
Wait a minute , Clarence .
Yes . Yeah .
Yeah .
No .
Yeah . Clarence , just a moment until I catch my breath .
Boys , boys , now don 't get excited .
Take it easy , take it easy .
Yes , hello , Clarence .
Yes , go ahead . Yeah .
Yeah .
No .
No .
Yeah. ls that all ?
Boys , do you remember that type we used when war was declared ?
Dust it off , boys .
Dust it off. lt 's war .
War , I 'm telling you , it 's war .
Mary .
Mary !
Mary !
It 's war !
Civilization is marching on Lynnfield .
Oh , Theodora , I thank you .
I thank you. I thank you .
On every front page in New York she 's giving your address , your apartment .
How long before they 'll know it 's your apartment ?
Call the police and have her thrown out .
With all New York looking on ?
That will be nice publicity for the governor 's reception .
You 're marvelous , Michael .
Here is a notorious woman .
Did you read what she says about herself ?
" Hidden away in a hamlet , her soul enslaved . "
- A woman leading a double life .
- lf not triple . Yes . And you have to go up in the country and get in the middle of it .
He was sketching it .
If this gets out , the governor will have fits .
Not to mention the disgrace to the name of Grant .
You know , if this woman 's really out to break up our marriage , Michael , maybe you and I ought to root for her .
You sit tight , Agnes , and do as you 're told .
That 'll be splendid , but let me say this .
If this woman really starts after Michael and it 's talked about all over town and I 'm made to look like a foolish deceived wife , I 'll have to do something to save my face .
And I 'll most certainly bring divorce action against Michael immediately .
Did you hear that , Michael ?
Yes .
- Pardon me .
- Pardon me .
- Pardon me .
- Pardon me .
- Pardon me .
- Pardon me .
- l beg your pardon .
- l beg yours , sir .
I have this to say to the modern young girl , gentlemen , be free , express yourself .
Take your life in your own hands and mold it .
The world will try to rob you of your freedom , but fight for it .
It 's all you have to live for .
- Miss Adams .
- Just relax .
That 's all for the modern girl , gentlemen .
What else ? Ask me anything .
Have you started a new book , Miss Adams ?
Well , no , I haven 't .
But I have it pretty well in mind .
Well , would you care to say something about it ?
I 'd love to. lt 's about how love came to a girl in a small New England town .
Outwardly , she seemed to belong to that narrow benighted little community , but in her heart , she longed to be called baby .
Out of the great big city , there came to this little hamlet the man who did call her baby .
From there on , gentlemen , the story warms up .
- Oh , Miss Adams .
- Just relax , sister .
I haven 't quite finished it yet , but I guarantee it for interest , if you know what I mean .
Would that be the story of your life , Miss Adams ?
- Oh , well , I shouldn 't wonder .
- And who would the man be ?
The man ?
Oh , now , come now , gentlemen .
A lady is entitled to one secret .
- Miss Adams .
- Just relax , and by the way , Miss Adams , is this Michael Grant 's apartment ?
Michael Grant , did you ...
Well , yes , this is Michael Grant 's apartment .
I was just getting to that . It 's a very interesting story , gentlemen .
Uncle John , Uncle John , come in .
Mr. John Lynn , the gentlemen of the press .
Uncle limps a little with the gout . Brought it on himself .
The only Lynn I 'm proud of .
Theodora , may I have a word in private with you ?
Oh , certainly .
I 'm afraid that 's all for today , gentlemen .
But what about Grant and this apartment ?
You were going to tell us the story about that .
Has Grant anything to do with the big bad man from the city who called you baby ?
Well , now , couldn 't we save that until tomorrow ?
But don 't be far off , will you ?
Goodbye , goodbye , goodbye .
Now , if you please , Miss Adams .
Didn 't you hear me say that I wanted to have a private word with my niece ?
- l beg your pardon .
- l beg yours .
How 's tricks , Uncle ?
Come on , snooksie .
Get up .
Go on , run along , boy .
Sit down .
Theodora , you 're terrific .
It 's just about what you 'd planned for me , isn 't it , darling ?
You exceed my wildest hopes .
Do you know what your aunts wired ?
Those two delightful old relics ?
No .
What ?
" Theodora 's gone wild . "
- Tut , tut , I haven 't started .
- Now just tell me this .
- ls everything all right ?
- Feet on the ground ?
- Both feet .
I knew it . A Lynn may go wild , but never silly .
Now , do you mind telling your nosey old uncle what made all this happen ?
What makes the world go round , darling ?
Say no more. I think I just saw the rascal .
That 's the guy that banged the door on the way out .
Oh , he 'll come back .
How 's Adelaide ?
It 's about time to send her up to that home .
Oh , then she 's going this week .
And I 'm going to tell that funny little old husband of hers that he 's going to be a papa .
Good .
Now , how about us going out and painting the town red ?
I 'm ready and raring to go . When do we start ?
That 's the next thing on the program .
It 's true that at present Miss Adams is residing in my apartment .
But in case you 're tempted to publish any conclusion regarding my relationship with Miss Adams , let me warn you ...
Please be advised .
Please be advised that I have never had the pleasure of meeting the lady . Having never been in Lynnfield in my life .
I think that 's smart in case they try to tie me up with that
- " man who came and called her baby " story .
- Very good .
And furthermore , the only thing I have in common with Miss Adams is our friendship with Mr. Arthur Stevenson .
During a recent fishing trip , Mr. Stevenson wired me and asked if Miss Adams could have the use of my apartment while she was in New York . I was more than glad to accommodate .
Paragraph .
The above facts can be verified by telephoning Mr. Arthur Stevenson .
All right , Miss Baldwin .
Get that out to the papers and all the news services as fast as you can . Yes , sir .
I could kill that woman with my two bare hands .
Excuse my laughing , Michael .
I know this is very tragic to you and your magnificent family . But it 's awfully funny to me .
- What 's awfully funny ?
- Yes , what 's so funny about it ?
Why , here 's this carefree rollicking spirit who 's been going around for years sticking his nose in everybody 's business and now he 's finally got it caught in a meat grinder .
Yeah . Very funny .
See that your nose doesn 't get caught in it , my pet .
Who , me ?
Why , what are you talking about ? It 's all perfectly clear to me .
That adorable young thing is an unholy terror on wheels .
There 's nothing in the world more deadly than innocence on the manhunt .
Why , sweetheart , you don 't think for one minute ...
No , I 'm telling you , my love .
You get on guard and stay on guard .
On account of little Ethie won 't stand for any fancy steps from her ducky - wucky .
You get funnier by the minute , darling .
- Hello .
- Hello , Arthur angel .
I 've got full steam up and you 're my only hope for the evening .
Uncle caved in and Michael is off moping somewhere .
Hello , Mr. Green .
There 's someone there .
That 's right , dear , don 't give us away .
Shall we say 7 : 30 for dinner ?
Why , I haven 't had a chance to read that contract yet , Mr. Green .
I 'm afraid I couldn 't discuss it with you tonight .
Well , I might suggest tomorrow sometime during the day .
Oh , but it 's got to be tonight , sugarfoot .
Because otherwise I 'll find myself another publisher and then you might lose your very best little writer .
Yes , yes , goodbye , Mr. Green .
Yes .
That was Mr. Green .
Theo , you wouldn 't leave me and go to another publisher , would you ?
No . No , Arthur . No , I wouldn 't dream of it .
I wouldn 't leave you .
Come on . - Here 's your house .
- No , this is your house .
No , it 's your house .
But I want to see that you get upstairs all right .
- Can I help you , lady ?
- No , I think I can manage somehow .
Say , you can 't take her away from me .
I 'm a better publisher than you are .
I don 't know what you 're talking about , mister .
If you 'll just put your arm around my shoulder and lean on me .
That 's right .
Don 't dream of it .
If some other publisher comes to you and tries to take you away from me , makes you a big offer , you just come to me .
I 'll do better , see ?
Yes , I will. I will .
If you leave me , Theo , the House of Stevenson would just fall to pieces .
- Arthur , I wouldn 't .
- You can 't leave me , Theo .
You gotta reconsider .
That 's the thanks I get. I discover you , I make you famous , you leave me flat .
- l 'll stay with you forever , Arthur .
- l know . The old knife in the back stuff .
Listen , listen , how much did he offer you ?
I 'll double it . Tell me ?
Tomorrow .
Tomorrow .
Where 's your key , Arthur ?
- Where 's your key , Arthur ?
- Where 's your key ?
- Oh , this is ...
- ls this it ?
805 ? - No. 805 .
- All right , all right .
Now , look . You let me get to the elevator , then you press the bell .
Okay .
- Good night , Arthur .
Listen , Theo , ask me whatever you want and it 's yours , only don 't leave me . - No , Theo , you can 't do that to me .
- You 've gotta stay with me .
- No , no .
No .
Oh , good evening .
Oh , hello , Ethie .
Cheese and crackers .
I got it , Clarence. I got it .
Sam .
Henry .
Clear the whole front page .
Okay , Clarence , I got it .
" Theodora named in divorce action . "
Disgusting .
" Theodora , the other woman , in suit brought by wife of publisher . "
" Charges misconduct
" between Theodora Lynn and publisher of Adams ' books . "
Her publisher .
Did you see this brazen picture of her ?
Lynnfield 's daughter is burning up the big town .
Small - town girl in big - time scandal .
How long is this kind of sinfulness going to make up the principal reading matter for our children and the whole community ?
- How long ?
- Yes , how long ?
Ask Theodora .
If you aren 't satisfied with the answer , stop Jed Waterbury from printing it .
But you wouldn 't do that , because this community is too all - fired nosey .
You couldn 't stand not knowing what 's going on .
It 's making us just a little sick of Lynnfield .
As long as I can remember , this town 's always wanted to know what 's cooking in the Lynn pot .
I think that 's about all , Rebecca .
Well , I hope you 're satisfied .
You 've blasted Ethel 's life to bits .
Don 't be silly , sweetheart .
Ethel understands .
She telephoned this morning and said the divorce action would be withdrawn .
- Come on in , and make yourself at home .
- No , Theodora .
Do you realize that you 're getting yourself the worst possible kind of a reputation ?
- Oh , then you do care , Michael ?
- Stay right where you are .
Go on . Keep your hands busy . Keep on playing the piano .
Theodora , listen to me , if you make any scandal before the governor 's reception ...
Theodora , please get out of town until that reception 's over .
That 's all I ask of you .
If you do , I 'll do anything .
I 'll come up to Lynnfield and talk to you within a month , only please get out .
You 're making my life miserable .
That 's the struggle that 's going on within you , Michael .
But don 't you worry .
The light breaks suddenly .
And then you 'll rise up and tell Papa what I told Lynnfield .
And then you 'll be so happy .
I 'll be happy when I 'm darn good and ready to be happy and not a minute sooner .
- Michael .
Michael . - Stay right where you are .
All right , Michael , look at me .
Tell me , do we still have to wait two years ?
Theodora , why can 't you be just a little reasonable ?
- Who 's that ?
- l don 't know .
- Oh , yes , the reporters .
- The reporters ?
Yes . Come on , Michael .
Now is your chance to make a declaration of independence . And tell them all about us right now .
- Never. lf you tell them my name ...
- ls Miss Adams in ?
- Hello . How are you , Miss Adams ?
- Hello .
Who 's this ?
The name 's Brown , you snoops .
Montmorency Brown .
Undertaker .
His Excellency , Governor Wyatt , and Mrs. Wyatt .
- Good evening , Mrs. Wyatt .
- How do you do ?
- Good evening , Governor . - How do you do , Michael ?
- Governor .
- Still painting , eh ?
- l 'm afraid so .
Pity he isn 't a statesman isn 't it , Governor ?
Painter ? Statesman ? Same thing .
Get your hands dirty at both .
Seems to me Michael Grant figured in the papers lately somehow .
I can 't for the life of me recall the incident .
Oh , you don 't mean in the story about that terrible woman , do you , Mrs. Wyatt ?
Yes , that 's it .
Didn 't she have your apartment ?
- What woman 's that ?
- Oh , some awful woman novelist .
With quite a private reputation , Governor .
Well , well . Of course , I 've never had the pleasure of meeting the lady .
You see , while I was on a fishing trip , I received a wire from Mr. Arthur Stevenson , my publisher , asking if she could have the use of my apartment during her visit to New York .
Of course , I was more than glad to accommodate .
And then , well , you know the newspapers .
I hope steps were taken to clear this up , Jonathan .
Certainly , Stephen , certainly .
Your father and I have been very careful to keep this administration clean , my boy .
Yes , yes , I 'm sure of that , sir .
- May I have this dance , Mrs. Wyatt ?
- Oh , delighted .
Oh , Stephen , may I remind you that there are 100 women just palpitating to dance with you ?
Well , if I must , I must .
Shall we ?
Thank you .
Very starchy party .
Well , I guess now we start following glad - hand Steve around and recording the governor 's moments of play .
Boys will be boys .
Couldn 't you smile just once for the sake of appearance ?
Charming .
Suppose you try it .
Angelic .
Isn 't this a lovely party , Jonathan ?
Oh , you dance divinely , Governor .
- Thank you , Miss ...
- Adams .
- lt can 't be .
- And she snagged the governor .
You 're a splendid dancer , too , Miss Adams .
- Oh , Governor .
- Yes , indeed .
Pardon me , Governor .
Do you mind , Governor ?
Smile . Thank you .
Thanks .
- Pardon me , please .
Hold it .
- Thank you , Governor .
Thank you . Thank you .
- Charming , Governor , perfectly charming .
- Why , thank you , thank you .
- Tell me quick , is that the woman ?
- ln person . This is terrible .
Michael , in five minutes , everybody in this house will know who she is .
They 've already got a picture of her with the governor .
I 'll take care of that .
You see that she gets out of this house .
Take her out into the garden or on the terrace , anywhere , and keep her there for the rest of the evening .
Hush , Jonathan .
Well , well . A delightful party .
I have just had the most fascinating dance .
Allow me to present Miss ...
- Adams .
- Yes , yes , Miss Adams .
Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Grant .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- And the Michael Grants .
- How do you do ?
- So nice , Miss Adams .
How do you do ?
It is a delightful party , isn 't it ?
I don 't know when I 've enjoyed myself so much .
- And the governor dances divinely .
- Thank you .
Thank you .
Give me a charming lady to dance with and , well , I 'm young again .
Well , there we are again , Miss Adams .
May I have the pleasure of this dance , Miss Adams ?
Young blood trying to force an old boy on the sidelines ?
You may not have this dance , my boy .
It 's mine . Miss Adams is my discovery and I am going to keep her .
Keep an eye out for my wife , please .
- Well ?
- Leave it to me .
- Oh , I 'm sorry .
- Oh , it 's quite all right . Quite all right .
- Governor , you are very cruel .
- How so ? Well , I 'm simply expiring to dance with you and you 've no use for me whatever .
The next one is yours , my dear .
Well , I 'm afraid I can 't wait , Governor .
Would you mind very much ?
Well , naturally I would , but then of course I know just how you feel .
Oh , thank you .
Do you remember this tune , Mr. Grant ?
Shall I sing it and you whistle ?
If you so much as open your mouth ...
How did you get in here ?
Well , now , if that isn 't the funniest thing .
You know , I said to myself ,
" l bet Michael is going to ask me how I got in here . "
How did you get in here ?
Michael , dear , this is hardly the place .
Will you tell me ?
Well , the Stevensons had invitations and decided not to come .
- So I just said to myself ...
- Come on out here .
- That 's my elbow .
- lt 's too bad it isn 't your neck .
- Would you mind , Mr. Grant ?
- No , no .
I 'd be delighted. ls this all right ?
I 'm sorry. I 've just met the lady with whom I 've been connected so much in the papers and I 'd like to make her acquaintance .
I 'd also like the privacy of the garden for a few moments , if you don 't mind . - Go right ahead .
- lt 's your garden . Go ahead .
Don 't catch cold .
You 're here to start something .
What are you here to do ?
- Do ? - Don 't tell me .
Wherever you are these days , something happens .
Why , Michael .
Now listen to me , Theodora , if you cause any scandal here tonight , I 'll never speak to you again in this lifetime .
That also goes if you aren 't out of this house in two minutes .
It also goes if you aren 't out of my apartment and outside of New York in two days . is that clear ?
- Do you mean all that big speech ?
- l mean every word of it .
- That I 'm to go back to Lynnfield ?
- To Lynnfield .
- And wait ?
- And wait .
Then this is goodbye , Michael ?
Yes , but there 's no need to go to pieces , especially here .
Oh , I 'm all right. I 'll go. I 'll go back .
But I would like to have something to remember you by .
- Sure .
Sure , anything .
Not here .
When I see you off , I 'll come down to the train .
- But you won 't .
You 'll be afraid .
- No . Yes , I will .
- Well , you won 't .
- But I will .
Thank you , Miss Adams .
Why , you lowlife sneaks .
You dirty , double - crossing ... lf you print that picture , I 'll break your necks .
If you print that picture , I 'll skin you alive .
I 'll track you down to the ...
And as for you , if I ever said I loved you ...
What 's going on here ?
The notorious Caroline Adams , novelist , in the arms of my husband .
- Who ?
- Yes , that 's right. lsn 't that nice ?
Jed , this is hot .
" Mrs. Michael Grant sues for divorce , branding Caroline Adams love thief . "
Henry , we use the red ink on this one .
Oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy .
Yes , siree .
Hot diggety dog .
- Two in a row .
- Pride of Lynnfield .
The brazen hussy .
I only hope that Mary and Elsie are bearing up .
That 's all I hope .
Jed .
Jed .
Shoot .
What now ?
Associated dispatch .
" Caroline Adams vanishes . "
What ?
You don 't mean it .
- Rebecca .
- Rebecca .
No trace of Lynnfield 's famous daughter in seven days .
John , stop your gabbing , John .
Do you know where Theodora is or don 't you ?
Why , I 'm surprised you even bother about Theodora .
After all her scandalous behavior .
What 's so scandalous about it ?
Fine time for a wild old buzzard like you to turn moral .
Hypocrite . The old skate .
Elsie , where do you suppose she is ?
Have you seen the baby ?
Yes , he 's a whopper .
A face like a full moon .
Thanks for coming up , Theodora .
Oh , don 't be silly. I had nothing else to do .
I brought someone with me .
He 's standing right outside the door .
Your baby 's papa .
Roger .
Go on , stupid . Go on .
Lynn , Miss Lynn .
" Plan to arrive Saturday on the 10 : 15 .
Love . "
What do you know about that ?
Well , who 's it from , idiot ?
Theodora .
Theodora .
Clarence , this is a private telegram .
Don 't go spreading it to the whole of Lynnfield .
Me ?
Why , I 'm surprised at you , Mary Lynn .
Oh , we 'll welcome her , all right .
I for one am going to stay right indoors and pull down my blinds .
And when she finds herself coming into an empty depot , I hope she 'll understand she isn 't wanted in Lynnfield .
We have the solemn word of every man , woman and child in Lynnfield that nobody will set foot in the direction of that depot .
How are you , Harry ?
Hello , Eddie . Great day .
The decorations are nice , don 't you think , Mary ?
Only there ain 't enough of them .
How are you , Elsie Lynn , Mary Lynn ?
How are the two oracles ?
Let me shake hands with you .
- Nice day , Jed .
- Greatest day in the world , Mary .
Great day for Lynnfield .
Great day for Lynnfield .
Quite a turnout , eh ?
You know , I always knew Theodora had it in her .
How do you do ?
How do you do ?
How do you do ?
How do you do ?
Well , I got to thinking it might be better to come and just stare at her .
Till she drops through the ground for shame .
Well , look who 's here .
Lynnfield 's Literary Circle .
Jed , Jed Waterbury , who brought this band here ?
I did , Rebecca Perry .
Now you get a lawyer and try to stop me from spending my own money any way I like .
Here she comes , lads , here she comes .
On your toes . On your toes . Now watch me .
Let ' er go !
Welcome home , Theodora .
Welcome home .
Suffering cats .
- Where did she get it , Grandma ?
- You go home and stay home .
On your toes , me lads , on your toes .
You 'd think they 'd never seen a baby in their lives .
So help me Hannah . This town gets more narrow - minded every day .
He is darling , isn 't he , Aunt Mary ?
- lt 's all right , Adelaide .
- Are you sure ?
Sure .
Nobody will see us .
Oh , so you 're bored , sissy ?
Well , snap out of it ! She 'll be here in a minute .
Come on .
Come on , get up here .
Get up here and let 's rehearse our speech .
Now listen , you 're Theodora and I 'm Michael .
Theodora , darling .
Theodora , darling , I am free and I thank you .
I 've never met so many people in all my life .
Theodora , we are free ...
Michael .
Michael .
Michael .
Michael , wait a minute .
- No , you don 't .
Shut the door .
- Michael !
Michael , what 's the matter with you ?
Michael .
Michael .
Michael . How can you be so ...
Michael !
How do you expect me to be when I come back and find something like that ?
- Wait a minute . - Don 't say " Michael . "
Talk about cutting loose .
You certainly cut loose when you got to New York .
Let me out of here , will you , please ?
- Michael , it isn 't mine , you stupid .
- Oh , no ?
No. lt 's Adelaide Perry 's .
It 's yours , Grandma .
Rebecca .
Michael , you idiot .
Jean Renoir was unable to complete this filim shortly after the second World War , while Renoir was in the U.S.A ... . .. other hands gathered together the footage that existed and respectfully assembled it in the form he intended
One summer Sunday in 1860, Monsieur Dufour , Parisian ironmonger .. ... borrowed a milk cart and set off to commune with nature accompanied by wife , mother-in-law , daughter and intended son-in-law
Any fish ?
Maybe there is , maybe there ain 't , you must know how to catch them
This is just the place We can eat at that little restaurant , do you agree , Madame Dufour ?
We 'll make our way round to it
So shady and cool
With swings too
What fish we 'll catch !
We 'll have a real feast mark my words
" Restaurant Poulain , fish dishes a speciality parties catered for , swings , luncheon 2Fr 50 "
Now just you stop that Monsieur Dufour !
Any fishing rods ?
Don 't you lend out fishing rods here ?
Fishermen bring their own
Let 's go somewhere else
Here I am and here I stay
Quite right , my dear .
we 'll eat here Send your master to me
Are you happy now you 're here , grandmother ?
We 'll have a good lunch
Oh no I 'm hungry
Henriette we 'll put the cart in the shade , she can get off there
They 're from a dairy
Yes it 's a milk cart , a whole family of milkmen
Let 's pack up and go. lf only there were some women
There are three
They want lunch , Monsieur Poulain
All right but first here 's your cold water , Monsieur Henri
Shall I fry the fish you caught this morning ?
I 'm fed up with fish
They taste of oil nowadays
- l 'll feed them to the cats .
- Feed them to the Parisians That 's a good idea
The customers are waiting Monsieur Poulain
They 'll want a picnic , Parisians always do .
There 's no peace nowadays lt 's a shame .
This was a delightful spot , conveniently close to Paris
Poulain wouldn 't mind if we swam in our drawers
- What about the gamekeeper ?
- He 's our friend , too
Parisians are like microbes. admit one and you have a colony in a week
- What , shall we do today ?
- Escape Row away up river
They 'll be gone when we return
Rowing 's no fun in this heat
You 're hopeless at mixing pastis
Let 's admire the view
Your father was very clever to find this spot
- Could we have fried fish ?
- l was about to suggest it
How lucky we are !
You expect fish here I 'd rather catch my own
We 'll have fish , rabbit saute , salad and dessert
Two litres of white wine and some Bordeaux
- Can we have a picnic ?
- Of course , we 're in the country
Why don 't we eat here ?
It 's already ordered
- We 're going already , then
- No ! I 'll write it down for you
- Shall we go down to the river ?
- Of course Anatole
Don 't disturb us we 're very busy
He 's preoccupied , you see
Wonderful invention , the swing
A fraud ; you see less than you imagine lf only she 'd sit down , the view would be much more interesting
I think I 'll talk to them .
They 'll be flattered to make our acquaintance lf they saw you coming they 'd flee to their men and you 'd end up with a milkmen 's boating party
Personally , that sort of affair doesn 't appeal to me
You go in for love eternal
- What do you mean ?
- A year with Hortense !
- She was very beautiful
- But what a ninny I didn 't ask intelligence of her
And you 'd still be with Lea if she hadn 't married poor Gustave I 'm a family man at heart I 'm fed up with tarts , and even
You 're afraid of the pox No , of responsibilities .
What would you do with that girl on the swing ?
I 'd invite her for a row . We 'd land somewhere to stretch our legs Then I 'd have a little fun
Suppose a baby lf children resulted from every bit of fun , the world would be overpopulated
What if she fell in love with you ?
She 'd have good taste
Don 't be a fool. I can 't picture you in a dairy
You 'd do nothing about it , and you might ruin her life , mightn 't you ?
Let 's go and find your father
She 's a very nice girl
She 's a smasher. lf only she knew how to dress I 've made you a tarragon omelette
How about pig 's brawn today ?
Have you seen the Parisians ?
The woman 's all right
- The daughter you mean
- No , she 's too skinny
You fancy the mother ?
What a woman !
Something to get hold of there .
Elegant , too
You 're making my mouth water I 'm too busy , but if I were in your shoes ...
Listen to the old widower
He 's certainly fallen for the mother
All right. I 'm not afraid of responsibilities I 'll take the girl , and the risks involved
You can take the mother and pass a carefree afternoon
Shall we take them separately or together ?
That sort are like herrings .
they only move in shoals
Not so much salt , you 'll be thirsty
Could we have our picnic here ?
It 's nice and shady but what about ants ?
There aren 't any , but there are cherries .
Could we eat some ? We ought to ask permission
You 'll frighten the fish .
Don 't you ever think what you 're doing ?
You see that place , where l 'm pointing ?
Where it 's deep l reckon pike lurk there , waiting to pounce on their prey
They eat their own weight in other fish every day
That 's why they 're known as freshwater shark
And they 're hard to catch , they can bite through the thickest line
Could they bite your finger off ?
Their teeth will certainly cut to the bone
Funny things in rivers
Nature still guards plenty of secrets , my friend
- A pike ? - No , a chub
Haven 't you ever heard of a chub , you ignoramus ?
- lt 's tiny - lt 's not all that small lf only we had fishing rods
What a lovely caterpillar
Don 't touch it , you 'll get a rash lt 's not dirty , it eats grass only
How amazing the country is
Every blade of grass hides tiny , living things
We may kill some with every step lf you worry like that , you 'll get nowhere I wonder if such things are happy and sad like us
Of course not , they 're not people Anyway , they 're too small
But they are born and die like us l must say , I wonder how caterpillars have their young
They don 't have young .
That one will become a lovely butterfly
You see some strange things
When you were young , I mean when you were my age ... did you often visit the country ?
No more than you I wonder if you felt as strange as I do today
Strange ?
Well , you see , I feel a tremendous sort of tenderness
.. for the grass , the water , the trees
A vague sort of yearning lt 's like a catch in the throat
It almost makes me want to cry
Did you feel like that when you were young ?
My dear child , I still feel like that only I 'm older and wiser
Come and see !
There are some capital boats
Your hat !
Leave it. we 'll picnic here
My skirt is caught , how messy the country is
They 're skiffs .
Anatole . I know all about them
So we 're agreed to go " fishing " , what method shall we use ?
Casting would be most elegant
Live bait , dead bait or artificial lure ?
A delicate lure for females
- Where shall we fish from ?
- The boat I fancy
The mother will have to be trawled for
I can imagine her pinning on these flowers before setting out
Give it to me. I 'll show you why I need it
She loves me she loves me not ls it worth it ?
I 'd rather just lie down and smoke After a quarter of an hour you 'll be bored
The wind 's changed look at those clouds
Drat these flies !
There 'll be a storm
We 'll feel better after it
- ls that a skiff ?
It 's so pointed - To help it go fast
- Would you like a trip ?
- l 'd be afraid
Their speed makes them very stable I wouldn 't go in one
- l 'm not afraid - You must learn to swim first
Can you swim ?
I could , but I 've forgotten , I didn 't need it in trade
What 's this for ?
They 're rowlocks , another word for them is dames
Oarsmen never set out without their dames
Yes , with a boat like that I could easily row from here to Paris in an hour
Do you think we could hire them ?
No they 're private property Anyway , the weather 's changing I shouldn 't be surprised if we had a squall
A squall is a nautical term for a storm , you ignoramus
Lunch is ready
- We should eat indoors if it 's stormy
- No , picnic beneath the cherry tree
Your daughter is right , let 's have our fill of air
As I was telling Anatole in Paris we 're short of oxygen
We 'd like to picnic under the cherry tree .
May we eat the cherries ?
Tell grandmother that lunch is ready
And bring the umbrella , in case it rains
They 've taken our place I expect they 're the boaters We 'll have to find somewhere else
Yes , but where ?
- By the jetty
- Too many nettles
- By the bridge ?
- Yes by the bridge
- l wanted the cherry tree . - Anyway , get your hat
Did you mislay your hat , Mademoiselle ?
You are too kind
Did you wish to picnic ?
I warn you , the cherries aren 't very good , but the place is all yours
- We 're not disturbing you ?
- On the contrary
On behalf of the ladies , I accept with gratitude your generous offer
Well , Henriette , you have your cherry tree I 'm sure they are both young gentlemen
They 're certainly not tradesmen
They 've swalloed the gentle , but it 's much too early to strike don 't you understand anything ?
Yes , but I 'm tired of your technical terms
For a shopkeeper 's daughter , that girl has style I was surprised by her bearing
Are they the Prevert brothers ?
No , they 're boaters
Yes. I knew the Preverts when they were babies but now the eldest is going to school I think
Yes , we 'll write it down for you
The Parisians are going to get wet
Do you want anything else ?
How about a little stroll in the woods , Cyprien ?
Remember last year at Conflans Saint Honorine when we both got lost in the forest
- l 'm sure there are ants here
- You 're imagining things ln my corsage !
Unlace me
How aggravating he is
Anatole stop hiccuping
Stop hiccuping Anatole , or I 'll have hysterics
He should drink some water
There 's only wine here lf you were a man , you 'd find some water
Anatole you 're ridiculous
That came from the stomach Let 's go to the kitchen
Where are you off to now ?
To drown yourself ?
Scratch me Henriette Not there , more to the right
Now is the time to strike
- Lace me up - l can 't , they 're looking
Lovely weather but unnaturally heavy as you say I think it will storm
You don 't mind the smoke ?
I 'm used to it , my husband smokes like a chimney
- You did well to come here
- The fried fish was excellent I meant it was well for us , there 's little company here usually
We were overjoyed to hear that pretty Parisiennes had arrived I mean it quite seriously , Madame
You men are all the same
And on the swings what grace what charm !
Wild horses would not have dragged me from the sight
Do those lovely boats belong to you ?
How about us four going for a row ?
There are many lovely spots on the river
I don 't know if we should
We might get caught in the rain .
And we must ask Monsieur Dufour
The clouds have passed
Shall I ask Father ?
These gentlemen can go with you , to explain to him
Just a moment , please . Henriette
These young men are very well mannered lt seems to me that you 're poaching in my waters
You go with her to find Father , I 'll get the fishing rods
- You 're not so stupid my friend
- Less stupid than you think
- Do you often visit the country ?
- Once a year - l 'm here every Sunday
- You 're lucky
Try to come here more often
We haven 't time for such trips .
my family is in trade
You seem to be less worried about the responsibilities now
You have responsibilities , some joint-enterprise ?
Yes , but we don 't always agree
Sometimes we cheat each other
That 's how it is with partners ;
Father prefers to work alone
My hiccups have quite gone , Monsieur Dufour I told you so , water never fails
Can Mother and I go boating with these two gentlemen ?
And you may like to try a little fishing
Fishing rods at last !
And here are some maggots - and some rotten cheese , chub love that
Do pike love rotten cheese too ?
You 're an ignoramus , Anatole
Aren 't we lucky , Monsieur Dufour ?
I told you we 'd go home with a catch , Anatole
Gentlemen , I don 't know how to thank you
Your kindness and generosity are truly worthy of the name gentlemen
Well , Father ?
Can we go boating ?
Of course. I 'll have no qualms if you 're with these two gentlemen
Where is the best place for fishing ?
Poulain throws his scraps by the stunted willow , so chub gather there
And that 's where we 'll gather , too
I 'm hooked up
You 'll have my eye out with those rods , you fool !
Hurry it 's getting late
Mother , Father agrees
You must go very gently with ladies , they 're delicate
That 's why we love them
Excuse me for a moment
- How shall we arrange it ?
- lt 's arranged itself I 'm a sport. I 'll take the mother
I 'm so frightened , isn 't it rather dangerous ?
I put myself in your hands eyes closed , like a child
Never fear. I 'll guard you like my life lt 's a pity the boat is so narrow
Otherwise we could sit side by side and row like lovers
Oh , really ! I wouldn 't dare
You look almost naked in that shirt
- Where is your shop ?
- Rue des Martyrs
That 's not too built up lf they 'd let you , you could visit us here , I 'd meet you at the station
- Father would never agree
- That could be arranged
Monsieur Dufour , what time should we come back ?
Whenever you like but keep quiet !
Anatole , give me your fishing rod
You 're an ignoramus Anatole !
I did so want to go boating I 'm sure rowing is not as easy as you make it seem
We 're just gliding along .
It 's so quiet here I feel it would be a sin to make a noise and break the silence
- Silence ?
The birds are making a din
- Their song is part of the silence
Do you like the river ?
So do l. l come here often
Wouldn 't you like to get out ?
To stretch our legs
Monsieur Henri , I 'd really rather not
Because it 's late and Mother will worry I 'm sure she 's on her way back already
You really want to go back ?
Very well , as you wish I think it would be best if we went back
I 'm not a bit afraid and Monsieur Rodolphe is very skilful I 'm not going to turn back until we must
- Listen to that bird
- A nightingale singing to the hen lf we go quietly , we 'll get very close to it
I 've never seen anything so beautiful
It 's all enclosed like a house I often come here , I call it my study
It 's in that tree
And what is your name , Madame ?
- How forward you are !
Why do you ask ?
- So that I may court you
Try to guess I give up
Juliette
And I 'm Romeo
- You 're Rodolphe
- But now I feel more like Romeo
Wherever did you get such ideas ?
Years passed , with Sundays as bleak as Mondays
Anatole married Henriette , and one Sunday
I often come here , it brings back my happiest memories and I remembert it every night
Well dear , time for us to go
For the lady of the camellias .
And they 're almost twice as large as usual .
I shall have twice as many as usual tomorrow .
Twice as man ... ?
Oh , don 't listen to her , Barjon .
I know what those things cost .
Aren 't you willing to listen to her when she orders hats and dresses from you ?
They 're an investment .
Of course , I order too many flowers , hats and too many everything .
But I want them .
To the theater .
And there 's no limit to your extravagance .
Now , you won 't be young forever .
It 's high time you settle something about your future .
And I know the very man for you .
- Really ?
- Yes , really .
Aren 't you interested to know who it is ?
Oh , yes , who is it ?
The Baron de Varville , one of the richest and most elegant gentlemen in Paris .
One foot in the grave and a wig on his head .
Not at all . Not at all .
Quite the contrary .
He 's young and handsome .
I heard from one of the girls in my shop who heard from his valet he 's gonna be at the theater tonight .
That 's why I wanted you to look your best .
Come here .
I want to send a note .
And I 'll give you a handsome tip if you get it to the right person .
Do you know the Baron de Varville ?
- Yes , Madame .
- Good .
Well , that 's done .
We go this way .
My dear , you 're as good as a baroness already .
Don 't forget .
I arranged it all .
- Where are we sitting ?
- Box A , of course .
I always ask for Box A.
The baron can 't miss it .
Come , come , old dear , open Box A.
- Someone else is in there .
- What ?
- Good evening .
Let me see your ticket .
- Here .
- Why , this says Box B.
- I asked for Box A.
If you 'd wear your spectacles , you 'd see what you get .
- None of your lip .
- Not so much fuss .
- Wait , who 's in there ?
- A friend of yours .
- Olympe .
- Olympe .
Right .
Well , what 's so funny about it , I 'd like to know .
How you arranged everything for Olympe .
That cat .
If you think I 'm going to let a cheating , lying wretch like that upset my plans , you 're wrong .
- She 's got to change places with us .
- Well , fight it out , ladies .
- My angel .
- Marguerite , darling .
Oh , how are you , my dear ?
How beautiful we look this evening .
- Nice perfume .
What is it ?
- That 's my secret .
- And how are you , you old robber ?
- You 're great for teasing , aren 't you ?
Is there any point in our staying out here in this draft ?
Oh , look here , Olympe , there 's been a little mistake about our tickets and we want you to change boxes with us .
Why ?
I can 't understand why you must sit in this box when yours is just as good .
Well , you know Prudence .
She 's a woman full of secrets .
Even changing her corset is a great mystery .
Some things have to be a mystery .
But if you 'll do what I ask you to do , I 'll send you that fur toque for a present .
It 's a bargain .
During the intermission , I 'll move .
Come here , Marguerite .
A note for Monsieur le Baron .
- Which is Box A ?
- There , Monsieur le Baron .
At the left .
Show me to my seat .
Doesn 't Monsieur le Baron wish to send an answer ?
I 'll wait and decide that later .
My dear , do you see that gentleman standing up ?
- Which one ?
- In the second row on the aisle .
- Yes .
Do you know him ?
- I know who he is .
He 's the fabulously rich de Varville , Baron de Varville .
I didn 't know that rich men ever looked like that .
This one does .
He 's looking at us .
He 's seen us looking at him .
I 've changed my mind , Prudence .
You can keep your fur toque .
The Baron de Varville is on his way to this box , and I 'm going to stay and meet him .
But he 's coming here to meet me .
- So that 's what you had up your sleeve .
- I invited him to join us here myself .
Nothing could be better .
Thank you , my dear Prudence , for arranging it .
But having done so much , you really must let me receive him alone .
- Unfortunately , I like him too .
- Why unfortunately ?
Because his eyes have made love to me all evening .
That 's a lie .
He barely glanced at you .
I never took my glasses from his face except for an instant to let him see mine .
Perhaps that was the instant he smiled at me .
He did not smile at you , and he won 't meet you here .
- Then he must look for me somewhere else .
- Sit down , Marguerite .
Listen , Olympe , I appeal to your sense of honor , if you have such a thing .
Oh , shut up , you old woman .
Get out before I have you dragged out .
Come , come , Prudence .
You really are a fool , Olympe .
You 're the fool .
You know that Prudence is nothing but an old vulture .
Vulture !
She called me a vulture .
That one who 'd pick a dead man 's pocket .
I 'll tell you something else .
If you don 't stop being so easygoing with money you 'll land in the gutter before you 're through .
Or back on that farm where you came from milking cows and cleaning out henhouses .
Cows and chickens make better friends than I 've ever met in Paris .
Come here .
Stop the baron going to Box A. Tell him to join us in Box B. Hurry .
Hurry !
Monsieur le Baron .
There has been a mistake , Monsieur le Baron .
The lady who sent you the note does not wish you to go to Box A but to join her and her friend in Box B.
So it is you .
Do come in , monsieur .
But your answer , Monsieur le Baron .
You may say that for the moment I am engaged .
- Are you following me ?
- Yes .
You ... Well , you did smile at me a moment ago , didn 't you ?
Well , you tell me first whether you smiled at me or at my friend .
- What friend ?
- You didn 't even see her ?
- No .
- That 's very nice .
I was wondering if you 'd ask me to sit down if I knocked at the door of the box .
Why not ?
We really seemed fated to meet this evening , didn 't we ?
Fate must 've had something to do with this evening .
I 've hoped for it so long .
- You don 't believe me ?
- No .
The first time I saw you was a year and a half ago .
You were in an open carriage and dressed in white .
I saw you go into a shop in the Place de la Bourse .
Yes , that might 've happened .
I went to a dressmaker in Place de la Bourse .
You were wearing a thin dress with miles of ruffles a large straw hat , an embroidered shawl , a single bracelet and heavy , gold chain and , of course , the camellias at your waist .
You have a marvelous memory , haven 't you ?
The next time was at the Opéra Comique .
You were sitting in a box with a fur coat on and Gaston , a chap whom I know who knows you said , " Marguerite 's been ill . "
And that hurt me .
- The next time ...
- Tell me , if all you say is true why have you never spoken to me before ?
- In the first place , I didn 't know you .
- You didn 't know me tonight .
No , but after you smiled at me , I knew you wouldn 't mind .
And now , since you 've met me ?
Now I know that I love you and have loved you since that first day .
Marguerite , my dear .
After what happened , I had to have a brandy .
- And after that , two brandies .
- Yes , and then he made me have another .
Well , that 's only four .
Suppose you go and have another , Prudence , and then ...
Well , then another .
- You don 't want to get me drunk , do you ?
- She wants to get rid of us .
She wants to be alone with my friend .
For once in your life you 're quite right , Gaston .
Who is your friend anyway ?
Baron de Varville , this is my neighbor , Madame Duvernoy .
- Baron de Varville ?
- He , the Baron de Varville ?
No wonder she wanted to get rid of us .
Well , I ... I never said I was the " Baron " anybody .
There 's the Baron de Varville sitting over there , big as life , with that wretch , Olympe .
- Really ?
- Certainly .
Well , this is rather funny .
- Funny ?
- Yes , I quite agree with you .
It is funny .
Oh , even if you 're not Baron de Varville , sit down .
I can 't believe I 'm wanted now that my unimportance has been discovered .
Don 't be silly .
Who are you anyhow ?
My name is Armand Duval .
I 've never had any reason to be ashamed of it .
- Armand Duval .
- Yes .
I 'm not always sincere .
One can 't be in this world , you know .
- But I am not sorry the mistake happened .
- Nor am I.
The baron keeps looking over here .
That must worry Olympe .
Well , as long as you don 't wish to sit down , would you go and buy me some sweets ?
You can afford a pound of marrons glacés even if you 're not the rich baron , can 't you ?
I 'll not come back with your sweets too soon .
- What is your friend 's name ?
- I 'm not sure which friend you mean .
The girl in the opposite box whom you just spoke to .
Oh , her .
Well , she 's hardly a friend .
I know her , of course .
But she 's not easy to get along with .
Ask anybody .
What did you say her name was ?
And she has a reputation of being one of the most extravagant girls in Paris as well as one of the most insincere .
- I like sincerity , don 't you ?
- It 's an admirable quality .
Well , I insist on it .
She 's the kind who says one thing and thinks another .
- Who ?
- Marguerite , the girl we were talking about .
Marguerite .
- What is her other name ?
- Gautier .
Not that it 's her real name .
She had some sort of very common name , I hear , when she came to Paris .
There 's no use boring you about her .
A friend of mine is giving a small party tonight , if you 'd care to come .
I detest parties .
Thank you for a very charming entr 'acte , my dear .
Will I see you again ?
I should think it 's very likely , sometime .
Good evening .
- Good evening .
- Good evening .
- I hope I don 't intrude .
- No .
You 're very welcome , baron .
I was delighted when I saw that you were alone .
Oh , monsieur , I 'm so sorry I kept you waiting .
I had to go to two shops before I found your marrons glacés .
It doesn 't matter .
I 'm in no hurry .
But since nothing but marrons glacés would do , these are very fresh .
- Will monsieur try one ?
- Thank you .
Thank you , monsieur .
The coachman wishes me to remind Monsieur le Baron there are four horses to manage , and they 're restless .
Very well .
I must go .
I think I 'll change my mind and take you with me .
- The doctors warned me against Russia .
- But Russia isn 't cold in summer .
Even so , the trip would be too much for me .
I shall get tired .
I shall get ill again .
And you 'll be bored .
Now , what shall I give you to remember me by ?
- You can 't give the only thing I 'd like .
- What ?
A tear .
- You 're not sorry enough I 'm going .
- Oh , but I am sorry .
Is there anything I can do for you before I go ?
Yes .
I 'm going to an auction this afternoon .
- I would like to buy a pair of horses .
- I just gave you a pair .
Yes , but these horses belonged to my friend , Eugenie Clivet who died a few weeks ago .
And I know she 'd like me to have her horses .
Well , what of it if you don 't need them ?
Olympe wants them .
She always wants everything I want and I don 't want her to have them .
Are you really as jealous of Olympe as all that ?
I don 't believe it .
I 'll be frank with you .
I want Clivet 's horses because I want the coachman .
And he 'd be miserable without the horses .
- He must be very young and handsome .
- Oh , no .
He 's quite old .
He 's older than Nanine .
But , well , he needs someone to take care of him , and I know Olympe won 't .
So much heart and so little sense .
I shall take a good look at your new coachman when I come back .
- Thank you .
- Now , goodbye .
Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Keep an eye on her , Nanine .
Two thousand two hundred and forty for this magnificent pair of chestnuts .
They 're the finest pair in the whole of France .
Why , they 're worth 5000 at least .
- Two thousand five hundred .
- Bid , Nanine , 3000 .
- Twenty-five hundred once .
- Three thousand .
So that 's what you came for .
I might 've known it .
Three thousand and one hundred francs .
Three thousand seven hundred and fifty .
- Four thousand .
Four !
- Four thousand .
Four thousand for this fine pair of chestnuts which is easily worth 7 .
- Oh , that 's too much .
- Of course .
Don 't bid anymore .
- I won 't .
- No .
Four thousand one hundred .
- Four thousand one hundred .
- Four thousand five hundred .
- Five thousand !
- Five thousand .
Five thousand !
Five thousand francs for this magnificent pair of chestnuts , ladies and gentlemen .
They can be sold any day for 10 .
- Five thousand one hundred .
- Six thousand .
- Six thousand .
- Six thousand .
Six thousand .
Six thousand francs .
Six thousand francs .
Ladies and gentlemen .
Once , twice .
Ladies and gentlemen , sold at 6000 francs .
Well , I hope they don 't run away and kill you .
I hear they 're none too safe .
Go settle with the auctioneer , Nanine .
Tell the old coachman we 'll take him with the horses .
- You really have a heart , Marguerite .
- Yes .
It 's going to cost her a lot .
- I hope mine never gets that soft . - Don 't worry , it won 't .
It 's a great mistake for any woman to have a heart bigger than her purse .
Prudence , did you invite them to my party tomorrow ?
I thought the baron disliked parties .
He won 't be there .
He 'd be bored with my friends .
- Have you quarreled ?
- Not yet , but don 't give up hope , Olympe .
- Nichette .
- Marguerite .
How well you look .
How happy .
It must be love .
- It is .
- Still the same young man ?
Of course .
And just think , Marguerite .
He talks of our getting married .
Just as soon as he 's passed his examinations and is a real lawyer .
- You seem to think that 's very fine of him .
- But of course I do .
After all , I have no dowry , and he 's a gentleman and educated .
Even so , why should the mention of marriage go to your head ?
But , Marguerite , it 's ideal to love , and to marry the one you love .
I have no faith in ideals .
Amuse yourself if you wish .
But remember , you can always do better than a penniless lawyer .
I never want to do better than Gustave .
Well , well , time changes our minds , as well as our hearts .
Perhaps you won 't go on being a little goose always .
Only , come and see me now and then .
Remember , you 're my oldest friend in Paris .
I will , Marguerite .
Soon .
I often think of those days we worked in the linen shop .
I 'm so glad to see you today and that you 're looking so well .
I always look well when I 'm near death .
Armand Duval .
- Where are my marrons glacés ?
- I ate them , Madame , six months ago .
What a pity .
However , I 'm glad of this opportunity of returning something belonging to you .
- Yes ?
- I found it on the floor when I came back .
- And you kept it with you all this time ?
- Yes .
- Always with you ?
- Always with me , like an old friend to remind me that I 'm not the Baron de Varville .
- That 's not a very romantic reason .
- No , I kept it as a warning against romance .
How sensible .
Has it made you very cynical ?
- Yes , very .
- Is that why you 've never called on me ?
- Perhaps .
- I 'm sorry .
One needs friends .
Well , I 've been looking for you .
Monsieur , you can see for yourself , she 's quite well again .
Oh , no , Nanine .
Well , or would be if she took proper care of herself .
Why would my health interest Monsieur Duval ?
Because he came every day when you were ill to ask how you were and to leave flowers .
He 's the one ?
Tell her yourself .
He just said " a friend , " so I thought ...
- All right , Nanine .
Wait for me downstairs .
- Yes , Madame .
Monsieur .
- You might have asked to have seen me .
- Well , I knew there were so many others .
There were no others .
None during all those weeks the doctors thought I might die .
Not even the Baron de Varville ?
Baron de Varville chose to be in England at the time .
No , you were the only one that took the trouble to ring my bell .
- But now ...
- Now I 'm well again , and all goes merrily .
Would you come to a party I 'm giving tomorrow night ?
It 's my birthday .
Aren 't you afraid you 're not strong enough yet ?
Oh , I 'm afraid of nothing except being bored .
- It 's supper after the theater .
- Thank you , I 'll come with pleasure .
And bring this book as a present .
Have you read it ?
- I never read anything .
What is it ?
- Manon Lescaut .
- Who was she ?
- A beautiful girl who lived for love and pleasure .
It 's a beautiful color .
It should be a very good story .
Yes , it is , but it 's rather sad .
She dies in the end .
Well , then I 'll keep it , but I won 't read it .
I don 't like sad thoughts .
However , we all die .
So perhaps this will be sold again someday at an auction after my death .
- I thought you didn 't like sad thoughts .
- I don 't .
But they come sometimes .
- Au revoir , Monsieur Duval .
- Goodbye .
Marguerite , my child , are we waiting for someone , my dear ?
- Or are we just waiting for supper ?
I was so afraid you wouldn 't come .
- Here 's the book I brought you .
- Thank you .
We were just about to sit down .
- Will you come ?
- Oh , I remember you , young man .
- You 're the bogus baron .
- Tactful as always , Prudence .
- You may all sit where you wish .
- Thank you so much .
Now , I 'm going to sit next to Gaston , and you sit over here .
Thank you .
Oh , Marguerite , how charming this table looks .
- And how are you this evening , Madame ?
- Very well , and how are you , monsieur ?
Good gracious , listen to them .
Why so formal ?
Why not ?
This is a very elegant soiree .
Well , elegant or not , if I 'm going to enjoy my supper I 've got to take off these tight shoes .
Help me , Gaston .
Can 't you manage to hold it a little higher ?
There .
- What are those little fellas on that dish ?
- Partridges , Madame .
- Put some on my plate . - Some ?
How many do you think you 'll get ?
Partridges are not oysters , you know .
Well , they don 't look much bigger than oysters .
- The funniest story I 've ever heard in my life .
- What 's the joke ?
I shall die !
- Tell me , tell me .
- Get closer .
- Tell me .
- Oh , no , tell me .
Well , no fair .
Tell us all .
Tell me the story , Gaston .
I know what 's coming , but you go on .
I want a laugh too .
Tell me the story .
I 'll tell you .
You 've probably heard it before .
It 's as old as Prudence .
- What 's that about my being old ?
- I said that the story was as old as you are .
I 'm 36 .
