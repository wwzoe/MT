honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended the first to the meeting in committee . 
i am surprised that the committee and that it will rise know what to do with the Senate independent . too 
that will not concern for the time so . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
the work that on a senator over the next two years undertaking . 
it is an important , because , in principle , these new Senate committee to determine what sit committee some senators . 
i am therefore presented to the sitting of the committee to realize that one of the nine of yesterday was indeed senators . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I will name people . 
you will see that I am kind ' t it ? 
the Senate will have their own to find that had been because research . 
when one a work , it must accept the do . 
the sitting in the Senate women who have proven . 
they will have much more that the majority of the men in the Senate remplissaient . 
i remember as the that held the hold to the committee of veterans in February 1998 . 
the Senate or the House of Commons do here at that stage Ni . 
they sat in the proceedings of the committee , all of the three senators women . 
the leadership of the Senate could not find a person to the committee . 
i could cite , to say , the hon. senator Carstairs took answer the question I asked word . 
i asked him : " were the criteria are as follows Quels ? " 
she said that it was to address the representation of women in the first report a . 
it was written on the parliamentary associations that in 1993 . 
delegations at the time was formées only of men . The 
this is in this regard , I have been replaced by the Senate Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I will look forward to enter the preferred my association . 
honourable senators , I do not know how when the House will be or about these two reports decision . 
the Senate is that each on television verdict . 
or by a group of students , from journalists wondered or other . 
if we do that ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
if a senator accept in a position to a committee , he or she should participate in any meetings intended . 
we are not the members of the words in which the corridors : 
" do you in committee today and after two years of education , there is a question Présentez in committee final '' . 
they do not even know what they are viewed , they stand out when they stand the their leaders . 
no they do not know what happened . 
honourable senators the words " and " and " continuité " is the way in our dedication speech . 
over the next two weeks , to look at the way we will start the Senate independent . into 
if we do not do that , on my own créerai of Parliament who are interested in the world affairs committee . 
no one can we try to . 
Honour the Speaker : the 
if any other hon. Senator wishes to speak , you will , is it the pleasure honourable senators , to adopt the motion ?

( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
