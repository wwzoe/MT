honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended the first to meeting of the committee . 
and I am surprised that the committee to rise not really know what to do with the Senate independent . 
that will not so concerned about at this time . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
on the work that a senator undertaking over the next two years . 
it is an important committee , as in principle , these new senators to determine what sit committee some senators . 
i am therefore presented to the sitting of the committee to yesterday to realize that one of the Senate nine was indeed . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I will name people . 
you will see that I am kind ' t it ? 
the Senate will have their own research to find that had been fault . 
when one accepts an , it must work to do . 
the women who are sitting in the Senate have proven . 
they have remplissaient have much more that the majority of the men in the Senate . 
i remember as the to hold the held to the committee of veterans in February 1998 . 
the Senate Ni or sitting in the House of Commons do not the time . 
three senators they sat in the proceedings of the committee , all of women . 
the leadership of the Senate could not find a person to the committee . 
i could cite , to say that words , the hon. senator Carstairs took answer the question I asked . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
she said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
that they were prepared to the parliamentary associations in 1993 . 
shall delegations at the time was only formées of men . 
this is in this regard , I have been replaced by the Senate Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I will look back the opportunity to my association preferred . 
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will be ruling in regard to these two reports . 
every time the Senate that is on television verdict . 
wondered or by a group of students , from journalists or other . 
that if we do ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he or she should participate in any provided meetings . 
we are not members of the words in which the corridors : 
" - Présentez you today and in committee , after two years of education , there is a final question in committee '' . 
they do not even know what they are viewed , they stand out their leaders when the stand them . 
no they do not know what happened . 
honourable senators the words " and " and " continuité dedication '' is the way in our speech . 
over the next two weeks , starting to reflect on the way we will address the independent senators . 
if we do not do that , I créerai my own committee of Parliament who are interested in the world affairs . 
no one can we try to . 
the the Speaker : Honour 
if any other hon. Senator wishes to speak , do you , is it the pleasure honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
