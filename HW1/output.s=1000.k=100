honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended the first to meeting of the committee . 
i am surprised that the committee and admits that it does not really know what to do with the Senate independent . 
that will not so concerned about at this time . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
the business of strikes a Senate that over the next two years . 
it is important , because of a committee , these new Senate , supposedly to determine what sit committee some senators . 
my presented to the sitting of the committee will therefore to note that one of the new Senate yesterday was indeed . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators name , I do not know . 
you will see that I am kind ' t it ? 
the Senate will have their own to find that had been because research . 
when one a work , it must accept the do . 
the women who are sitting in the Senate have proven . 
they will have much more that the majority of the men remplissaient in the Senate . 
i remember as the sessions held that the committee to the veterans in February of 1998 . 
the Senate Ni or are sitting in the House that point . 
they sat in the proceedings of the committee , all three senators of women . 
the leadership of the Senate could not find a person to the committee . 
i could cite words , words , the hon. senator Carstairs took to answer the question I asked . 
i asked him Quels were the criteria are as follows : " ? " 
she said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
it was struck by the parliamentary associations that in 1993 . 
shall delegations were formées only of men at that time . 
in this regard , I have been replaced by Senator Finestone on for a number of years . 
however , I will look forward to enter the preferred my association . 
senators , I do not know how or honourable House when the decision about these two reports will be . 
the Senate is that each on television verdict . 
or a wondered of students , from journalists or any group . 
if we do that ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
if a senator accept this position in committee , he or she should participate in any meetings a package . 
we are not which put it in the corridors of hon. members : 
" Présentez do you today and in committee to study after two years , there is a final question in committee '' . 
they do not even know what is viewed , they stand out when they stand to them their leaders . 
no they do not know what happened . 
honourable senators the words " continuité '' , " and " is the way in our dedication speech . 
over the next two weeks , look at the way we are beginning to address the independent senators . 
if we do not do that , on my own créerai of Parliament who are interested in the world affairs committee . 
no one can we try to . 
the Honour the Speaker : 
if any other hon. Senator wishes to speak , you will , honourable senators , is it the pleasure to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
