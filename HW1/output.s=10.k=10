honourable , what happened here , last Tuesday Senate ? 
a committee was selection achievement . 
yesterday I attended the first to the meeting in committee . 
i am surprised that the committee , which is known rise what to do with the Senate independent . too 
that will not concern for the time so . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
on the work that an undertaking in the Senate next two years . 
it is an important committee , supposedly , as these new senators to determine what sit committee some senators . 
i am therefore presented to the sitting of the committee to realize that one of the nine of yesterday was indeed senators . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I will name people . 
you will see that I am , did he not nice ? 
the Senate will have their own to find that had been because research . 
when one a work , it must accept the do . 
the sitting in the Senate women who have proven . 
they will have much more that the majority of the men in the Senate remplissaient . 
i remember as the that held the to the committee of veterans in February hold 1998 . 
the Senate or the House of Commons do here at that stage . Ni 
they sat in the proceedings of the committee , all of the three senators women . 
the leadership of the Senate could not find a man to the committee . 
i could cite , so that the hon. senator Carstairs took answer the question I asked word by word . 
i asked him : " were the criteria are as follows Quels ? " 
she said that it was the first the representation of women in a report to address . 
it was that of the parliamentary associations in 1993 drafted . 
delegations at the time was formées only of men . The 
this is in this regard , I have been replaced by the Senate for a number of years Finestone . 
however , I will look back the opportunity to my association preferred . 
honourable , I do not know how or when the House will be decision about these two reports senators . 
each time that the Senate is on television verdict . 
or by a group of students , from journalists or other wondered . 
if we do that ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
if a accept this position in a committee , he or she should participate in any meetings senator intended . 
we are not of the House the words in which the corridors : 
" do you in committee today and after two years of education , there is a question Présentez in committee final '' . 
they do not even know what they are , they stand out when their leaders considers the they stand . 
they do not know what happened no . 
honourable the Senate and say " " and " continuité " is the way in our dedication speech . 
over the next two weeks , to look at the way we will start the Senate independent . into 
if we do not do that , on my own committee of Parliament who are interested in the world affairs créerai . 
no one can we try to . 
Honour the Speaker : the 
if any other hon. Senator wishes to speak , you will , is it the pleasure senators , to adopt the motion honourable ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
