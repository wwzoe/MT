honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a committee selection was achievement . 
yesterday I attended on the first meeting of the committee . 
and I expected the committee rise which is known too what to do with the Senate independent . 
what will not strike so for the time . 
the committee selection can show some impact . 
on the work that undertaking a senator over the next two years . 
it is a committee important , because , in principle , these new Senate actually to what committee sit some senators . 
i am therefore presented to the sitting of the committee yesterday ' s to realize that one of the new Senate was indeed . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I do name people . 
you can see what that I am kind ' t it ? 
the Senate will have their own research to find that had been fault . 
when one accepts an work , it must the do . 
the women who sit in the Senate have proven . 
they remplissaient their duty much more that the majority of the men in the Senate . 
i remember as the hold that held the to the committee of veterans in February 1998 . 
Ni the Senate or the House of Commons do here at that time . 
three senators they sat in the proceedings of the committee , all of women . 
the leadership of the Senate could not find a man to the committee . 
i could cite , word by word , the hon. senator Carstairs took responded to the question I asked . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
it was that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
that they were prepared to the parliamentary associations in 1993 . 
shall delegations at the time was formées only of men . 
in this regard , on I was replaced by the Senate Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I look want the opportunity to enter my association preferred . 
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will be decision on these two reports . 
every time that the Senate are verdict on television . 
or wondered by a group of students in journalists or other . 
that if we do ? 
it is true , and I will believe . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not think of the option . 
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he or she should participate in any meetings intended . 
we are not the members which we say in the corridors : 
" Présentez do you in committee today and after two years of education , there is a question final in committee '' . 
they do not even know what they are viewed , they stand out when their leaders stand to them . 
they do not know no what happened . 
honourable senators , the words " continuité " and " dedication '' is the way in our speech . 
in the next two weeks , starting to reflect on the way we will address the Senate independent . 
if we are the are not , I créerai my own committee as parliamentarians who are concerned about the world affairs . 
no one can we are try . 
the Honour the Speaker : 
if any other hon. Senator are wishes to speak , you is it the pleasure of honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , and the report agreed to )
